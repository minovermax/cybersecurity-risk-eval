{"cik": "1232524", "company": "Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our ordinary shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nRisks Related to Xyrem and Our Other Marketed Products\nXyrem is our largest selling product, and our inability to maintain or increase sales of Xyrem would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nXyrem\u00ae (sodium oxybate) oral solution is the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, in adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Xyrem is our largest selling product, and our financial results are significantly influenced by sales of Xyrem, which accounted for 75% and 74% of our net product sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our future plans assume that sales of Xyrem will increase, but there is no guarantee that we can maintain sales of Xyrem at or near current levels, or that Xyrem sales will continue to grow. We have periodically increased the price of Xyrem, most recently in January 2019, and there is no guarantee that price adjustments we have taken or may take in the future will not negatively affect Xyrem sales volumes and revenues from Xyrem.\nOur ability to maintain or increase Xyrem product sales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The most important of these risks and uncertainties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales of and revenue from Xyrem, are discussed in more detail in this Part I, Item 1A and include those related to:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, Xyrem in the treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of a generic version of Xyrem in the U.S. market before the entry dates specified in our settlements with the abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, filers or on terms that are different from those contemplated by the settlement agreements;\n\u2022\nincreased pricing pressure from, changes in policies by, or restrictions on reimbursement imposed by, third party payors, including pressure to agree to discounts, rebates or other restrictive pricing terms for Xyrem;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare laws and policy, including changes in requirements for patient assistance programs, rebates, reimbursement and coverage by federal healthcare programs, and changes resulting from increased scrutiny on pharmaceutical pricing and risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, programs by government entities;\n\u2022\nchanges to or uncertainties around our Xyrem REMS, or any failure to comply with our REMS obligations to the satisfaction of the FDA;\n\u2022\nchallenges to our intellectual property around Xyrem, including the possibility of new ANDA or new drug application, or NDA, filers or new post-grant patent review proceedings;\n\u2022\noperational disruptions at the Xyrem central pharmacy;\n\u2022\nany supply or manufacturing problems, including any problems with our sole source Xyrem active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, provider;\n\u2022\ncontinued acceptance of Xyrem by physicians and patients, including as a result of negative publicity that surfaces from time to time; and\n\u2022\nchanges to our label, including new safety warnings or changes to our boxed warning, that further restrict how we market and sell Xyrem.\nIf sales of Xyrem were to decline significantly, we might need to reduce our operating expenses or seek to raise additional funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects, including on our ability to acquire, in-license or develop new products in the future to grow our business.\nThe introduction of a new product in the U.S. market that competes with, or otherwise disrupts the market for, Xyrem would adversely affect sales of Xyrem.\nWhile Xyrem is currently the only product approved by the FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy, we and others may launch products as treatment options in cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy, including other branded sodium oxybate products and other new and existing branded market entrants. In addition, Xyrem will face competition from generics and authorized generics. We expect that the approval and launch of any other sodium oxybate or alternative product that treats narcolepsy, or the launch of an authorized generic product, or AG Product, or other generic version of Xyrem, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of and revenues from Xyrem and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWith respect to generic and authorized generic competition, nine companies sent us notices that they filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem, and we filed patent lawsuits against each of them, asserting that such generic products would violate our patents covering Xyrem. As of October 2018, we have settled patent litigation with all nine companies. In our settlement with the first filer, West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC), or West-Ward, we granted West-Ward the right to sell an AG Product in the U.S. beginning on January 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances. These include circumstances related to the licensing or market entry of another generic sodium oxybate product, a final decision that all unexpired claims of the Xyrem patents are invalid and/or unenforceable, or a substantial reduction in Xyrem net sales over specified periods of time. West-Ward has a right to elect to continue to sell the West-Ward AG Product for a total of up to five years. We also granted West-Ward a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product as early as six months after it has the right to sell the West-Ward AG Product, but if it elects to begin selling its own generic product, it cannot continue to sell the West-Ward AG Product. In our settlements with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, or Amneal, Lupin Inc., or Lupin, and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Par, we granted each party the right to sell a limited volume of an AG Product in the U.S. beginning on July 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances, including events related to the acceleration of West-Ward\u2019s AG Product launch date, the earlier launch of another party\u2019s AG Product, the launch of another generic sodium oxybate product or a final decision that all unexpired claims of the Xyrem patents are invalid and/or unenforceable. We also granted each of Amneal, Lupin and Par a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product under its ANDA on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances, including events related to the launch of another generic sodium oxybate product or a final decision that all unexpired claims of the Xyrem patents are not infringed, or are invalid and/or unenforceable. If an acceleration event occurs, then each of Amneal, Par and Lupin will have the option to elect to market its AG Product until December 31, 2025, but will not be entitled to market its AG Product and its own generic sodium oxybate product simultaneously. Under the terms of our settlement agreements, we are entitled to receive royalty and other revenue based on sales of AG Products. In our settlements with each of the other five ANDA filers, we granted each a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product under its ANDA on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances, including the launch of another generic sodium oxybate product.\nIn order to launch a generic sodium oxybate product, an ANDA filer must obtain and maintain FDA approval of its ANDA. In January 2017, the FDA approved West-Ward\u2019s ANDA and tentatively approved two additional ANDAs for generic sodium oxybate products, and we believe that it is likely that the FDA will approve or tentatively approve the additional ANDAs that have been filed.\nAny ANDA holder launching an AG Product or another generic sodium oxybate product will establish the price of the AG Product and/or its own generic sodium oxybate product. Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold. After any introduction of a generic product, whether or not it is an AG Product, a significant percentage of the prescriptions written for Xyrem may be filled with the generic product. Certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available. This would result in reduction in sales of, and revenue from, Xyrem, although we would continue to receive royalty and other revenue based on sales of an AG Product in\naccordance with the terms of our settlement agreements. For more information on the impact of generic competition, see the risk factors under the heading \u201cAdequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably\u201d and \u201cThe pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nIt is possible that additional companies may file ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Xyrem which could lead to additional patent litigation or challenges with respect to Xyrem. Such patent litigation or challenges could potentially trigger acceleration of the launch dates in our settlement agreements. For example, the launch dates in our settlement agreements would be accelerated if a new ANDA filer were to obtain a final decision prior to January 1, 2023 that all unexpired claims of the Xyrem patents are invalid and/or unenforceable. Alternatively, the launch dates in our settlement agreements could be accelerated if a new ANDA filer were to obtain FDA approval for its sodium oxybate product, and launch its generic product through a generic sodium oxybate REMS before the entry dates specified in our settlement agreements, if, for example, we are unable to obtain an injunction or because that party launches \u201cat risk\u201d of being held liable for damages for patent infringement. It is also possible that we could enter into a settlement agreement with a future ANDA filer that would permit such filer to enter the market on or prior to the launch date(s) in our settlement agreements. If a company launches a generic or authorized generic sodium oxybate product in any of these scenarios, except in limited circumstances related to an \u201cat risk\u201d launch, the launch date for West-Ward\u2019s AG Product would be accelerated to a date on or prior to the date of such entry, which could lead to acceleration of the other settling ANDA filers\u2019 AG Product and generic sodium oxybate product launch dates as described above. For further discussion of Xyrem-related patent matters, see the risk factors under the heading \u201cRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\u201d in this Part 1, Item 1A.\nAnother circumstance that could trigger acceleration of West-Ward\u2019s launch date for an AG Product, which would also accelerate Amneal, Lupin and Par\u2019s launch dates for their AG Products and ultimately could lead to acceleration of the other settling ANDA filers\u2019 launch dates for their generic sodium oxybate products, is a substantial reduction in Xyrem net sales. Such a reduction could occur under various circumstances, including if we introduce, or a third party introduces, a product to treat EDS or cataplexy in narcolepsy that leads to a substantial decline in Xyrem net sales prior to January 1, 2023. For example, we are developing JZP-258, an oxybate product candidate that contains 90% less sodium than Xyrem. Given the well-accepted relationship between dietary sodium and blood pressure as well as published hypertension guidelines underscoring that excessive consumption of sodium is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease and other adverse outcomes, we believe that lower sodium intake would be beneficial for patients. JZP-258 is being developed for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy as well as for other conditions, and, subject to the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial in narcolepsy, we expect to file an NDA for approval of this product by as early as the end of 2019. Other companies may similarly develop a sodium oxybate product for treatment of narcolepsy, using an alternative formulation or a different delivery technology, and seek approval in the U.S. using an NDA approval pathway under Section 505(b)(2) and referencing the safety and efficacy data for Xyrem, which could lead to additional patent litigation or challenges. We are aware that a company called Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc, or Avadel, is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of a once-nightly formula of sodium oxybate which uses its proprietary technology for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy, and has indicated that it intends to seek approval using the Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway. Approval and successful commercialization of JZP-258, or Avadel\u2019s sodium oxybate formulation, or any other new non-generic sodium oxybate or other product for treatment of narcolepsy patients could negatively impact our ability to maintain and grow sales of Xyrem.\nAlthough, as noted above, Xyrem is currently the only product approved by the FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, we are aware that prescribers often prescribe branded or generic medications for cataplexy before prescribing or instead of prescribing Xyrem, and that payors often require patients to try such medications before they will cover Xyrem, even if they are not labeled for this use. For example, prescribers often treat mild cataplexy with drugs that have not been approved by the FDA for this indication, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. These drugs have known side effects, including for example, somnolence or insomnia, that can be problematic for patients with narcolepsy. We are also aware that branded or generic stimulants may be prescribed off label for treatment of EDS in narcolepsy. Wake-promoting agents Provigil\u00ae (modafinil) and Nuvigil\u00ae (armodafinil), and their generic equivalents are labeled for treatment of EDS in narcolepsy and other conditions, and may be used in conjunction with or instead of Xyrem. Prescribers often prescribe these medications before prescribing or instead of prescribing Xyrem, and payors often require patients to try such medications before they will cover Xyrem.\nIt is possible that additional branded or generic products may be introduced to treat symptoms of narcolepsy that will also be prescribed before or instead of Xyrem, or that payors will require patients to try before they will cover Xyrem. For example, Harmony Biosciences LLC, or Harmony, has exclusive U.S. rights to seek approval of and commercialize pitolisant, a drug that has already been approved in Europe to treat adult patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. Published data and prescribing patterns in the EU suggest that pitolisant would likely be appropriately used in patients with less severe cataplexy\nthan those treated with Xyrem. While pitolisant is not currently approved in the U.S., Harmony has established an expanded access program for pitolisant, received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations from the FDA and, in February 2019, announced that the FDA had accepted for filing with priority review its pitolisant NDA.\nNon-oxybate products intended for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in narcolepsy, even if not directly competitive with Xyrem, could have the effect of changing treatment regimens and payor coverage of Xyrem, which could materially and adversely affect sales of Xyrem.\nThe distribution and sale of Xyrem are subject to significant regulatory restrictions, including the requirements of a REMS, and these regulatory requirements subject us to risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem.\nThe active ingredient of Xyrem, sodium oxybate, is the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, a central nervous system depressant known to be associated with facilitated sexual assault as well as with respiratory depression and other serious side effects. As a result, the FDA requires that we maintain a REMS with elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, for Xyrem to help ensure that the benefits of the drug in the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy outweigh the serious risks of the drug. The REMS imposes extensive controls and restrictions on the sales and marketing of Xyrem that we are responsible for implementing. For example, under the Xyrem REMS, all of the Xyrem sold in the U.S. must be dispensed and shipped directly to patients or caregivers through a central pharmacy, and may not be stocked in retail pharmacies. Physicians and patients must complete an enrollment process prior to fulfillment of Xyrem prescriptions, and each physician and patient must receive materials concerning the serious risks associated with Xyrem before the physician can prescribe, or a patient can receive, the product. The central certified pharmacy must monitor and report instances of patient or prescriber behavior giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of abuse, misuse or diversion of Xyrem, and maintains enrollment and prescription monitoring information in a central database. Any failure to comply with our REMS obligations, or a determination by the FDA that the Xyrem REMS is not meeting its goals, could result in enforcement action by the FDA, lead to changes in our Xyrem REMS obligations, negatively affect sales of Xyrem, result in additional costs and expenses for us and/or require us to invest a significant amount of resources, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWhile we believe that the Xyrem REMS has met its goal of mitigating the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse, abuse and diversion of Xyrem, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will agree or that the Xyrem REMS will continue to do so in the future. We are required to prepare and submit regular assessments of the Xyrem REMS, and the FDA has stated that it will evaluate the REMS on an ongoing basis and will require modifications as may be appropriate. We cannot predict whether the FDA will request, seek to require or ultimately require modifications to, or impose additional requirements on, the Xyrem REMS, including in connection with the submission of applications for new oxybate products, new oxybate indications, or the introduction of authorized generics, or whether the FDA will approve modifications to the Xyrem REMS that we consider warranted in connection with the submission of applications for new oxybate products. Any modifications approved, required or rejected by the FDA could change the safety profile of Xyrem, and have a significant negative impact in terms of product liability, public acceptance of Xyrem as a treatment for cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy, and prescribers\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to take, Xyrem, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Xyrem business. Modifications approved, required or rejected by the FDA could also make it more difficult or expensive for us to distribute Xyrem, make distribution easier for sodium oxybate competitors, disrupt continuity of care for Xyrem patients and/or negatively affect sales of Xyrem.\nIn October 2018, the FDA approved a modification to the Xyrem REMS in connection with our submission of our pediatric supplemental NDA to include information for pediatric patients and their caregivers. We are in the process of implementing the October 2018 modification to the Xyrem REMS. We have also submitted and expect to continue to submit ongoing assessments as required by the FDA. However, we cannot guarantee that our implementation and ongoing assessments will be completed on our expected timing or be satisfactory to the FDA, or that the Xyrem REMS will satisfy the FDA\u2019s expectations in its evaluation of the Xyrem REMS on an ongoing basis.\nWe depend on outside vendors, including the central certified pharmacy, to implement the requirements of the Xyrem REMS. We have an exclusive agreement with Express Scripts Specialty Distribution Services, Inc., the central pharmacy for Xyrem, which expires on July 1, 2019, but we expect to exercise our right to extend the agreement for an additional year. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time without cause on 180 days\u2019 prior written notice to the other party. If the central pharmacy fails to meet the requirements of the Xyrem REMS applicable to the central pharmacy or otherwise does not fulfill its contractual obligations to us, provides timely notice that it wants to terminate our agreement, refuses or fails to adequately serve patients, or fails to promptly and adequately address operational challenges or challenges in implementing REMS modifications, the fulfillment of Xyrem prescriptions and our sales would be adversely affected. If we change to a new central pharmacy, new contracts might be required with government payors and other insurers who pay for Xyrem, and the terms of any new contracts could be less favorable to us than current agreements. In addition, any new central pharmacy would need to be registered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and certified and would also need to implement\nthe particular processes, procedures and activities necessary to distribute Xyrem under the Xyrem REMS. Transitioning to a new pharmacy could result in product shortages, which would negatively affect sales of Xyrem, result in additional costs and expenses for us and/or take a significant amount of time, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nA generic version of a drug subject to a REMS with ETASU is required to have the same REMS as the brand drug, and generics and brands are mandated to use a single shared system REMS. However, the FDA may waive this requirement for a single shared system and approve an ANDA with a separate REMS with differing but comparable aspects of ETASU under certain circumstances. In its approval of West-Ward\u2019s ANDA, the FDA waived the shared REMS requirement, approving West-Ward\u2019s ANDA with a generic sodium oxybate REMS, on the condition that the generic sodium oxybate REMS be open to all future sponsors of ANDAs or NDAs for sodium oxybate products. In connection with the waiver, FDA issued a statement that it considers the generic sodium oxybate REMS to have the same ETASU as the Xyrem REMS and operationalizes those elements in a comparable manner to achieve the same level of safety as the Xyrem REMS. However, the generic sodium oxybate REMS, unlike the Xyrem REMS, permits multiple certified pharmacies and multiple databases that are connected via an electronic \u201cswitch\u201d system. The generic sodium oxybate REMS also requires the certified pharmacies in its system to contact the Xyrem REMS program to verify that the patient has no other active prescriptions for Xyrem that overlap with the generic prescription to be filled and to identify any patient and prescriber disenrollments from the Xyrem system for suspected abuse, misuse and diversion.\nWe were not involved in development of the generic sodium oxybate REMS and were not consulted regarding any features of this REMS. A sodium oxybate distribution system that is less restrictive than the Xyrem REMS, such as the generic sodium oxybate REMS, which provides that generic sodium oxybate products and potentially sodium oxybate products approved under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval pathway could be distributed through multiple pharmacies, could increase the risks associated with sodium oxybate distribution. Because patients, consumers and others may not differentiate generic sodium oxybate from Xyrem or differentiate between the different REMS programs, any negative outcomes, including risks to the public, caused by or otherwise related to a separate sodium oxybate REMS, could have a significant negative impact in terms of product liability, our reputation and good will, public acceptance of Xyrem as a treatment for cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy, and prescribers\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to take, Xyrem, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Xyrem business.\nWe may face pressure to further modify the Xyrem REMS or to license or share intellectual property pertinent to the Xyrem REMS, including proprietary data required for the safe distribution of sodium oxybate, in connection with the FDA\u2019s approval of the generic sodium oxybate REMS or otherwise. Our settlement agreements with ANDA filers do not directly impact the FDA\u2019s waiver of the single shared system REMS requirement, any other ANDA filer\u2019s ability to develop and implement the generic sodium oxybate REMS for its generic sodium oxybate product or our ability to take any action with respect to the generic sodium oxybate REMS. We cannot predict the outcome or impact on our business of any future action that we may take with respect to the FDA\u2019s waiver of the single shared system REMS requirement, its approval and tentative approval of generic versions of Xyrem or the consequences of distribution of sodium oxybate through the generic sodium oxybate REMS approved by the FDA or another separate REMS.\nREMS programs have increasingly drawn public scrutiny from the U.S. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the FDA, with allegations that such programs are used as a means of improperly blocking or delaying competition. The U.S. Congress, for example, has introduced proposed legislation aimed at preventing companies from using REMS and other restricted distribution programs as a means to deny potential competitors access to product samples needed for bioequivalence testing. The FDA has stated that it will seek to coordinate with the FTC in identifying and publicizing practices the FTC finds to be anticompetitive and has further stated that the FDA has concerns related to the role of REMS programs in delaying approval of generic products. For example, in May 2018, FDA published a list of companies that it said had potentially been blocking access to the samples of their branded products, including one of our subsidiaries that sells FazaClo\u00ae (clozapine, USP) through a REMS program. It is possible that the FTC, the FDA, other governmental authorities or other third parties could claim that, or launch an investigation into whether, we are using our REMS programs in an anticompetitive manner or have engaged in other anticompetitive practices. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act further states that a REMS ETASU shall not be used by an NDA holder to block or delay generic drugs or drugs covered by an application under Section 505(b)(2) from entering the market. In its 2015 letter approving the Xyrem REMS, the FDA expressed concern that we were aware that the Xyrem REMS could have the effect of blocking or delaying generic competition. We cannot predict whether we would face a government investigation or a complaint by a third party premised on a claim that the Xyrem REMS is blocking competition, or the outcome or impact of any such claim.\nPharmaceutical companies, including their agents and employees, are required to monitor adverse events occurring during the use of their products and report them to the FDA. The patient counseling and monitoring requirements of the Xyrem REMS provide more extensive information about adverse events, including deaths, than is generally available for other products that are not subject to similar REMS requirements. As required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, the adverse\nevent information that we collect for Xyrem is regularly reported to the FDA and could result in the FDA requiring changes to Xyrem labeling, including additional warnings or additional boxed warnings, or requiring us to take other actions that could have an adverse effect on patient and prescriber acceptance of Xyrem. As required by the FDA, Xyrem\u2019s current labeling includes a boxed warning regarding the risk of central nervous system depression and misuse and abuse.\nAny failure to demonstrate our substantial compliance with the REMS or any other applicable regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA or another regulatory authority could result in such regulatory authorities taking actions in the future which could have a material adverse effect on Xyrem sales and therefore on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading \u201cIn addition to those specifically described in other risk factors, we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nWhile Xyrem remains our largest product, our success also depends on our ability to effectively commercialize our other products.\nIn addition to Xyrem, we are commercializing a portfolio of products, including our other lead marketed products, Erwinaze, Defitelio and Vyxeos, and we are making significant investments in maximizing the value and therapeutic reach of Defitelio and Vyxeos by conducting additional research and development activities, which include generating additional supportive clinical data and seeking regulatory approval for new indications, as appropriate. Our inability to effectively commercialize our lead marketed products and to maximize their potential where possible through successful research and development activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nErwinaze\nErwinaze\u00ae (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi) is a treatment approved in the U.S. and in certain markets in Europe (where it is marketed as Erwinase\u00ae) for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Erwinaze is licensed from, and manufactured by, a single source, Porton Biopharma Limited, or PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes our license for Erwinaze, expires on December 31, 2020. We and PBL had been engaged in discussions related to entry into a replacement agreement to extend the term of our commercial relationship with respect to Erwinaze past 2020, but we did not reach agreement. Unless we and PBL enter into a new agreement, we will lose our license to Erwinaze after December 31, 2020, other than our right to sell certain Erwinaze inventory for a post-termination sales period of 12 months. In such event, we may not be able to replace the product sales we would lose from Erwinaze, which in 2018 totaled $174.7 million, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be materially adversely affected. In addition, we cannot predict whether uncertainty related to rights to, and availability of, Erwinaze after 2020 will impact sales of and revenues from this product.\nA continuing and significant challenge to our ability to maintain sales of Erwinaze and a barrier to increasing sales is PBL\u2019s inability to consistently supply product adequate to meet market demand. PBL\u2019s product quality and manufacturing issues have resulted, and continue to result, in supply disruptions, and our need for PBL to minimize or avoid additional supply disruptions due to capacity constraints, production delays, quality or regulatory challenges and other manufacturing difficulties. In addition, we have incurred and continue to incur significant internal and external costs and expenses as a result of these issues, including due to managing the increased need for regulatory and customer interaction. See the discussion regarding Erwinaze supply issues in the risk factor under the heading \u201cDelays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or our for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nOur ability to maintain sales of Erwinaze is also subject to a number of additional challenges, including the following as well as other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Part I, Item 1A:\n\u2022\nthe limited population of patients with ALL, and the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived asparaginase within that population;\n\u2022\nthe development of new asparaginase treatments or treatment protocols for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens and prescribers\u2019 use of alternate methods to address hypersensitivity reactions;\n\u2022\nthe failure to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA or UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, to release batches of Erwinaze requiring batch-specific approval due to quality and manufacturing issues;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with obtaining and maintaining favorable pricing and reimbursement arrangements;\n\u2022\npotential competition from future biosimilar products;\n\u2022\nPBL\u2019s ability to meet the manufacturing post-marketing commitments imposed by the FDA in connection with its approval of our biologics license application, or BLA;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with obligations under our agreement with PBL resulting in PBL claiming an uncured material breach; and\n\u2022\nour need to apply for and receive marketing authorizations, through the European Union\u2019s, or EU\u2019s, mutual recognition procedure or otherwise, in certain additional countries if we decide to launch promotional efforts in those countries.\nIf we fail to maintain revenue from sales of Erwinaze, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nTo expand our asparaginase franchise beyond Erwinaze, we are pursuing activities related to the development of improved asparaginase products for patients with ALL or other hematological malignancies. Several of our external research and development collaborations are focused on these efforts, including our agreement with Pfenex, Inc. which includes worldwide rights to develop and commercialize multiple early-stage hematology product candidates and an option to negotiate a license for a recombinant pegaspargase product candidate, and our agreement with XL-protein GmbH, or XLp, for rights to use XLp\u2019s PASylation\u00ae technology to extend the plasma half-life of selected asparaginase product candidates. If these activities are unsuccessful, our growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nDefitelio\nDefitelio\u00ae (defibrotide sodium) is a product approved in the U.S. in 2016 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, or VOD, also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, and in Europe in 2013 (where it is marketed as Defitelio\u00ae (defibrotide)) for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT therapy.\nOur ability to maintain and successfully and sustainably grow sales of Defitelio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following as well as other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Part I, Item 1A:\n\u2022\nthe continued acceptance of Defitelio in the U.S., the EU and other countries by hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees and the continued availability of favorable pricing and adequate coverage and reimbursement by government programs and third party payors;\n\u2022\nthe limited experience of, and need to educate, physicians in recognizing, diagnosing and treating VOD, particularly in adults;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that physicians recognizing VOD symptoms may not initiate or may delay initiation of treatment while waiting for those symptoms to improve, or may terminate treatment before the end of the recommended dosing schedule;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully maintain or grow sales of Defitelio in Europe and other non-U.S. countries, including our ability to obtain marketing approval in new countries;\n\u2022\ndelays or problems in the supply or manufacture of the product;\n\u2022\nthe limited size of the population of VOD patients who are indicated for treatment with Defitelio (particularly if changes in HSCT treatment protocols reduce the incidence of VOD diagnosis);\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the post-marketing commitments and requirements imposed by the FDA in connection with its approval of our NDA and by the European Commission, or EC, in connection with its marketing authorization granted \u201cunder exceptional circumstances\u201d; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals across Europe, particularly in countries that represent significant markets.\nTo expand the potential of Defitelio, our clinical development strategy generally focuses on the prevention and treatment of serious diseases associated with endothelial cell damage, including an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in prevention of VOD in high-risk patients following HSCT, ongoing Phase 2 trials in prevention of acute Graft versus Host Disease following allogeneic HSCT, and planned Phase 2 trials in the treatment of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy and the prevention of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy-, or CAR-T-, associated neurotoxicity. In addition to clinical trials we are sponsoring, there are more than 20 investigator-sponsored trials ongoing in the U.S. and EU to evaluate defibrotide in multiple conditions. If these development activities are unsuccessful, our growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause VOD is an ultra-rare disease, we have experienced inter-quarter variability in our Defitelio sales, which makes Defitelio sales difficult to predict from period to period. As a result, Defitelio sales results or trends in any period may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. If sales of Defitelio do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from the product would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nVyxeos\nVyxeos\u00ae (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection is a product approved in the U.S. in 2017 and in Europe in August 2018 (where it is marketed as Vyxeos\u00ae 44 mg/100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, or t-AML, or acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with myelodysplasia-related changes, or AML-MRC. We made a significant investment in Vyxeos through the acquisition of Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2017. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in Vyxeos by successfully and sustainably growing sales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following as well as other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Part I, Item 1A:\n\u2022\nour ability to differentiate Vyxeos from other liposomal chemotherapies and generically available chemotherapy combinations with which physicians and treatment centers are more familiar;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of Vyxeos in the U.S., the EU and other countries by hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees and the availability of favorable pricing and adequate coverage and reimbursement by government programs and third party payors;\n\u2022\ndelays or problems in the supply or manufacture of the product, including the ability of the third parties upon which we rely to manufacture Vyxeos and its APIs to manufacture sufficient quantities in accordance with applicable specifications;\n\u2022\nthe increasing complexity of the AML landscape requiring changes in patient identification and treatment selection, including diagnostic tests and monitoring that clinicians may find challenging to incorporate;\n\u2022\nthe use of new and novel compounds in AML that are either used off-label or are only approved for use in combination with other agents and that have not been tested in combination with Vyxeos;\n\u2022\nthe limited size of the population of high-risk AML patients who may potentially be indicated for treatment with Vyxeos, particularly given the ongoing clinical trials by other companies with the same patient population; and\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the post-marketing commitments and requirements imposed by the FDA in connection with its approval of our NDA and by the EC in connection with its marketing authorization.\nOur U.S. launch of Vyxeos is still at an early stage. The lack of prescriber usage data from U.S. commercialization of Vyxeos makes Vyxeos sales difficult to predict from period to period, and sales results or trends in any period may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. Following receipt of marketing authorization from the EC in late 2018, as part of our rolling launch of Vyxeos in the EU, we are in the process of making pricing and reimbursement submissions. If we experience delays or unforeseen difficulties in obtaining favorable pricing and reimbursement, planned launches in the affected EU member states would be delayed, which could negatively impact anticipated revenue.\nTo expand the potential of Vyxeos, our clinical development strategy is designed to target potential new patient segments across the AML landscape, to pursue indications related to myelodysplastic syndrome and to generate clinical data on Vyxeos when used in combination with other therapeutic agents. We are pursuing this strategy by sponsoring clinical trials, working with cooperative groups who are conducting clinical trials and partnering with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to evaluate potential treatment options for hematologic malignancies, with a near-term focus on Vyxeos. In addition, there are multiple investigator-sponsored trials ongoing. If these development activities are unsuccessful, our growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIf sales of Vyxeos do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from the product will be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nFor a discussion of the risks inherent in implementing our research and clinical development strategy with respect to Defitelio and Vyxeos, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading \u201cConducting clinical trials is costly and time-consuming, and the outcomes are uncertain. A failure to prove that our product candidates are safe and effective in clinical trials, or to generate data in clinical trials to support expansion of the therapeutic uses for our existing products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nWe face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios.\nOur products compete, and our product candidates may in the future compete, with currently existing therapies, product candidates currently under development by others and/or future product candidates, including new chemical entities that may turn out to be safer or more effective than our products. Any products that we develop may be commercialized in competitive markets, and our competitors, which include large global pharmaceutical companies and small research-based companies and institutions, may succeed in developing products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe also face competition, and may in the future face additional competition, from manufacturers of generic drugs. Certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician\nmandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available. Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold.\nThe commercial potential of our current products and any future products may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or acquire and commercialize generic or branded products that are safer or more effective, have fewer side effects, are easier to administer or are less expensive than our products.\nFor a discussion of specific risks relating to the launch of new products that treat cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy, including generic versions of Xyrem or other sodium oxybate products, see the risk factor under the heading \u201cThe introduction of a new product in the U.S. market that competes with, or otherwise disrupts the market for, Xyrem would adversely affect sales of Xyrem\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A. We expect that the approval and launch of any other sodium oxybate or alternative product that treats narcolepsy, or the launch of an AG Product or other generic version of Xyrem, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of and revenues from Xyrem and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWhile there is currently no direct competition to Erwinaze to treat ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, other companies have developed or are developing new treatments for ALL. Some new asparaginase treatments could reduce the rate of hypersensitivity in patients with ALL, and new treatment protocols are being developed for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens, including some for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL patients. We have experienced frequent intermittent shortages of the product that have impacted prescribing habits for Erwinaze, including prescribers\u2019 use of alternate methods to address hypersensitivity reactions. The development of these new treatments could negatively impact our ability to maintain, and potentially in the future grow, sales of Erwinaze in patient populations where the benefit of an asparaginase-containing regimen is not well established. As a biologic product, Erwinaze also faces potential competition from biosimilar products.\nWhile there is currently no direct competition to Defitelio to treat severe VOD, changes in the types of conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT may affect the incidence rate of VOD and demand for Defitelio.\nWith respect to Vyxeos, there are a number of alternative established therapies in AML. A key consideration in the treatment of AML patients is the patient\u2019s suitability for chemotherapy. The AML patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial supporting our NDA included fit patients, or those deemed able to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy. The existing options for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML and AML-MRC in fit patients include cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (i.e., daunorubicin), known as 7+3. In addition, we are aware of several other products that have been recently approved by the FDA or are in development as treatment options for newly diagnosed AML patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy, such as targeted agents (e.g. midostaurin, enasidenib and ivosidenib), immunotherapies (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin and CAR-T-cell therapy), and agents disrupting leukemia cell survival (e.g., glasdegib). We are also aware of the use of venetoclax, an AML treatment recently approved by the FDA. Some of the patient populations being studied for, or treated by, these products overlap with the patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial supporting our NDA. The existence of established treatment options and the development of competing products for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC could negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize Vyxeos and achieve the level of sales we expect.\nMany of our competitors, particularly large pharmaceutical and life sciences companies, have substantially greater financial, operational and human resources than we do. They can spend more on, and have more expertise in, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing activities. As a result, our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we can and may market their products more effectively than we do. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through focused development programs and collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.\nWe have a relatively small number of sales representatives compared with most other pharmaceutical companies with marketed products. Each of our sales representatives is responsible for a territory of significant size. Many of our competitors deploy more personnel to market and sell their products than we do. In particular, we compete with companies with extensive sales, marketing and promotional experience in hematology/oncology markets, and our failure to compete effectively in this area could negatively affect sales of our hematology/oncology products. If our sales force and sales support organization are not appropriately resourced and sized to adequately promote our products, the commercial potential of our current and any future products may be diminished.\nThe growth of our current products and the launch of any future products may require expansion of our sales force and sales support organization, and we may need to commit significant additional funds, management and other resources to such growth. We may not be able to expand in a timely or cost-effective manner, or we may not have the financial resources to achieve the necessary growth. We also compete with other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain pharmaceutical sales and marketing personnel, and excessive turnover in such personnel could negatively affect sales of our products.\nAdequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends in significant part on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Without third party payor support, patients may not be able to obtain prescribed medications due to barriers to access, including the inability to afford the medication.\nThird party payors\u2019 reimbursement practices are complex, vary widely from payor to payor and can impose time-consuming burdens for patients and prescribing physicians. As part of the overall trend toward cost containment, third party payors often require prior authorization for, and require reauthorization for continuation of, prescription products or impose step edits, which require prior use of another medication, usually a generic or preferred brand, prior to approving coverage for a new or more expensive product. Such restrictive conditions for reimbursement and an increase in reimbursement-related activities can extend the time required to fill prescriptions and may discourage patients from seeking treatment. For example, we are experiencing increasingly restrictive conditions for reimbursement required by some third party payors for Xyrem, which have extended the time required to fill some prescriptions and could continue to do so in the future and which may have a material effect on the overall level of reimbursement coverage for Xyrem. We cannot predict actions that third party payors may take, or whether they will limit the access and level of reimbursement for our products or refuse to provide any approvals or coverage. From time to time, third party payors have refused to provide reimbursement for our products, and others may do so in the future.\nReimbursement guidelines and incentives provided to prescribing physicians by third party payors may have a significant impact on the prescribing physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe our products. For example, the U.S. federal government follows a Medicare severity diagnosis-related group, or MS-DRG, payment system for certain inpatient hospital services provided under Medicare, which some states also use for Medicaid. The MS-DRG system entitles a hospital to a fixed reimbursement based on discharge diagnoses rather than actual costs incurred in providing inpatient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many healthcare products. For our hematology/oncology products, all of which are used primarily or exclusively in the inpatient hospital setting, there may not be sufficient reimbursement under the relevant MS-DRG to fully cover the cost of our products. In addition, in 2017 CMS approved, and reauthorized in 2018, a New Technology Add-on Payment, or NTAP, for Defitelio, and in 2018, approved an NTAP for Vyxeos. An NTAP is in addition to the MS-DRG-based reimbursement that hospitals receive. NTAP designations are reviewed by CMS on a yearly basis, and we cannot guarantee that CMS will continue the NTAP designation. If the NTAPs for Vyxeos or Defitelio are not renewed, the relevant MS-DRG may not fully cover the cost of our products.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our revenue from our hematology/oncology products, particularly Erwinaze and Vyxeos, is obtained through government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, and any failure to qualify for or receive adequate reimbursement under those programs, including as a result of legislative changes to these programs, would have a material adverse effect on revenues from such products. Significant attention has been paid to legislation proposing federal rebates on Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage utilization for drugs issued to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries and the desire to change the provisions that treat these dual-eligible patients differently from traditional Medicare patients. Any such changes could have a negative impact on revenues from sales of our affected products. Any failure to cover our products appropriately, in addition to legislative and regulatory changes and others that may occur in the future, could impact our ability to maximize revenues in the federal marketplace.\nOn February 6, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, published a proposed rule in the Federal Register proposing to modify the scope of the discount safe harbor to carve out discounts or rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, or other third party organizations known as PBMs, which are tasked with administering prescription drug programs for large employers, health plans and government programs, for patients receiving benefits under Medicare Part D or a managed Medicaid plan. While the potential impact of such a rule is still unclear, the potential disruption to the marketplace could have the practical effect of limiting our ability, in some instances, to effectively negotiate with PBMs for access to our products for patients. Medicaid and other governmental programs are described under the heading \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of specific risks relating to our reporting and payment obligations to government payors, see the risk factor under the heading \u201cIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A. Third party payors outside the federal government are also increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, including those used by federal government payors such as average net sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. It is not possible to predict the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products.\nThird party payors increasingly examine the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to their safety and efficacy, when making coverage and reimbursement decisions. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Even with such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third party payors may not provide and maintain coverage and reimbursement for our products. If our competitors offer their products at prices that provide lower treatment costs than our products, or otherwise suggest that their products are safer, more effective or more cost-effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of access for their products relative to our products, which would reduce our sales and harm our results of operations. In some cases, for example, third party payors try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. Because some of our products compete in a market with both branded and generic products, obtaining and maintaining access and reimbursement coverage for our products may be more challenging than for products that are new chemical entities for which no therapeutic alternatives exist.\nA small number of third party payors and PBMs have market power and negotiating leverage to limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, and to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments, or place drugs on formulary tiers with higher patient co-pay obligations, and/or to mandate stricter utilization criteria. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. In many instances, third party payors and PBMs may also exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position. In the past, we have not entered into such arrangements with third party payors for any of our products. The increasing pressure of the pharmaceutical coverage environment may require us to do so in the future, which could have a negative impact on our revenue from Xyrem.\nSpecifically, we are experiencing increasing pressure from third party payors to agree to discounts, rebates or other restrictive pricing terms for Xyrem. As our business becomes more complex, we may need to enter into rebate agreements in order to ensure that patients continue to have access to Xyrem, and to support the long-term success of our sleep franchise, which might result in lower net revenues for Xyrem.\nIf solriamfetol, our product candidate for the treatment in adult patients in EDS associated with obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, and EDS associated with narcolepsy, is approved by the FDA, the product will enter a competitive retail pharmacy market of branded and generic products. Any delays or unforeseen difficulties in obtaining access or reimbursement approvals could delay or prevent our commercial launch and our ability to receive a return on our investment in solriamfetol. Third party payors could impose steps edits that require patients to try alternative, including generic, treatments before authorizing payment for solriamfetol, exclude solriamfetol from formulary coverage lists, limit the types of diagnoses for which coverage will be provided or demand rebates, discounts, exclusivity or other concessions for solriamfetol and potentially our other products. Additionally, at launch, many payors impose a moratorium on coverage for products while the payor makes a coverage decision. These potential utilization management strategies could limit patient access to solriamfetol and depress therapy adherence rates. We cannot predict market acceptance of, and our ability to obtain adequate formulary positions, access to and reimbursement coverage for solriamfetol. An inability to obtain adequate formulary positions could increase patient cost-sharing for solriamfetol and cause some patients to determine not to use our product. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining broad coverage for solriamfetol, our anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for an approved solriamfetol product could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, if approved, new products indicated for the treatment of symptoms of narcolepsy, like solriamfetol or pitolisant, could impact access to Xyrem, particularly for newly diagnosed narcolepsy patients, if, for example, payors impose a step edit requiring a narcolepsy patient to try solriamfetol before authorizing payment for Xyrem. For more information on solriamfetol, see the risk factor under the heading \u201cOur future success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain and maintain regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe for our late-stage product candidates and, if approved, to successfully launch and commercialize those product candidates.\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nThe demand for, and the profitability of, our products could be materially harmed if the Medicaid program, Medicare program or other third party payors in the U.S. or elsewhere deny reimbursement for our products, limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed, or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business.\nThe pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes, particularly given the current atmosphere of mounting criticism of prescription drug costs in the U.S. We expect there will\ncontinue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together, the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment-for-performance initiatives. Additional legislative and regulatory changes remain possible and appear likely. Their nature and extent are uncertain and they will be subject to judicial and other challenges. For example, while \u201crepeal and replace\u201d efforts by President Trump and the U.S. Congress have failed, aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act have been changed legislatively, such as the repeal of the requirement that certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year make a tax-based shared responsibility payment commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d In addition, there have been delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, including the excise tax on generous employer-based health plans. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products.\nSome states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Healthcare Reform Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Healthcare Reform Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact our revenues. For details of the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B program, or the 340B program, see \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk factor under the heading \u201cIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A. The U.S. Congress could enact additional legislation that further increases Medicaid drug rebates or other costs and charges associated with participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program.\nIn addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, we anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, regulators and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies and reforms intended to curb healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include federal and state controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs, new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs, additional pharmaceutical cost transparency bills that aim to require drug companies to justify their prices through required disclosures, controls on healthcare providers, challenges to the pricing of drugs, or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means, requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product, expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person, and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third party payors to make coverage and payment decisions. For example, several states have passed laws or are considering legislation aimed at increasing transparency relating to drug pricing, and other states may do so in the future.\nThere also continue to be legislative proposals to amend U.S. laws to allow the importation into the U.S. of prescription drugs, which have not been subject to U.S. regulatory oversight. The potential importation of such prescription drugs could pose significant safety concerns for patients, increase the risk of counterfeit products becoming available in the market, and have a negative impact on prescription drug prices in the U.S.\nIf healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for our products, including Xyrem, may be affected, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted. We have periodically increased the price of Xyrem, most recently in January 2019, and may do so again in the future. We also have made and may in the future make similar price increases on our other products. There is no guarantee that such price adjustments will not negatively affect our reputation and our ability to secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products, which could limit the prices that we charge for our products, including Xyrem, limit the commercial opportunities for our products and/or negatively impact revenues from sales of our products.\nIf we become the subject of any government investigation or U.S. Congressional hearing with respect to drug pricing or other business practices, we could incur significant expense and could be distracted from operation of our business and execution of our strategy. Any such investigation or hearing could also result in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For more information, see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk factor under the heading \u201cIn addition to those specifically described in other risk\nfactors, we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nIn many countries outside the U.S., procedures to obtain price approvals, coverage and reimbursement can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval. The process of maintaining pricing and reimbursement approvals is complex and varies from country to country. Many European countries periodically review their reimbursement of medicinal products, which could have an adverse impact on reimbursement status. We cannot predict the outcome of any periodic reviews required to maintain pricing and reimbursement approvals across Europe. In addition, orphan products that have a significant impact on patient survival, such as Defitelio, may be budgeted on a local rather than national level. The balance of all of these factors will determine our ability to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals across Europe. Furthermore, after initial pricing and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities in other countries. In the EU, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries. If we are unable to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals in countries that represent significant markets, especially where a country\u2019s reimbursed price influences other countries, our anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for our products in the EU could be negatively affected.\nIn August 2018, the EC granted marketing authorization for Vyxeos, and, as part of our rolling launch of Vyxeos in the EU, we are in the process of making pricing and reimbursement submissions in EU member states. If we experience delays or unforeseen difficulties in obtaining favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals, planned launches in the affected EU member states would be delayed, which could negatively impact anticipated revenue from Vyxeos. If we are unable to obtain favorable pricing and reimbursement approvals in the EU member states that represent significant potential markets, our anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for Vyxeos in the EU could be negatively affected.\nIn various EU member states we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including those representing the larger markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product currently varies between EU member states.\nIn the EU, our products are marketed through various channels and within different legal frameworks. In certain EU member states, reimbursement for unauthorized products may be provided through national named patient programs. Such reimbursement may no longer be available if authorization for named patient programs expire or are terminated or when marketing authorization is granted. In other EU member states, authorization and reimbursement policies may also delay commercialization of our products, or may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nWe expect that legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU will continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down. Such measures could include limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third party payors, may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products. Further, an increasing number of EU member states and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as \u201creference prices\u201d to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some countries, including some EU member states, we may be required to conduct clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will obtain favorable reimbursement status in any country. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could negatively affect our growth prospects in Europe.\nIn addition to access, coverage and reimbursement, the commercial success of our products depends upon their market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and the medical community.\nIf physicians do not prescribe our products, we cannot generate the revenues we anticipate from product sales. Market acceptance of each of our products by physicians, patients, third party payors and the medical community depends on:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which a product is approved and any restrictions placed upon the product in connection with its approval, such as a REMS, patient registry requirements or labeling restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence of the disease or condition for which the product is approved and its diagnosis;\n\u2022\nthe severity of side effects;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\navailability of sufficient product inventory to meet demand, particularly with respect to Erwinaze;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 decisions relating to treatment practices based on availability of product, particularly with respect to Erwinaze;\n\u2022\nperceived advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nwith respect to Xyrem, physician and patient assessment of the burdens associated with obtaining or maintaining the certifications required under the Xyrem REMS;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including generic products; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of financial or other assistance for patients who are uninsured or underinsured.\nBecause of our dependence upon market acceptance of our products, any adverse publicity associated with harm to patients or other adverse events resulting from the use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies, including generic versions of our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, from time to time, there is negative publicity about illicit GHB and its effects, including with respect to illegal use, overdoses, serious injury and death. Because sodium oxybate, the API in Xyrem, is a derivative of GHB, Xyrem sometimes also receives negative mention in publicity relating to GHB. Patients, physicians and regulators may therefore view Xyrem as the same as or similar to illicit GHB. In addition, there are regulators and some law enforcement agencies that oppose the prescription and use of Xyrem generally because of its connection to GHB. Xyrem\u2019s label includes information about adverse events from GHB.\nFor additional discussion about payor acceptance, see the risk factor under the heading \u201cAdequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nDelays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of process controls required to consistently produce the API and the finished product in sufficient quantities while meeting detailed product specifications on a repeated basis. We and our suppliers may encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, process controls, quality control and quality assurance, including testing of stability, impurities and impurity levels and other product specifications by validated test methods, and compliance with strictly enforced U.S., state and non-U.S. regulations. In addition, we and our suppliers are subject to the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements, DEA regulations and equivalent rules and regulations prescribed by non-U.S. regulatory authorities. We have cGMP responsibilities for the products we manufacture in our facilities and also have oversight responsibilities for the manufacturing conducted by our third party suppliers operating under contract. If we or any of our suppliers encounter manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties with respect to any of our products, we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or meet commercial demand for such products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, the failure of any of our suppliers to comply with cGMP or other rules and regulations while manufacturing products on our behalf could result in regulatory action directed at the adequacy of our oversight of our contract suppliers, which could result in enforcement actions against us by the FDA and other regulatory entities.\nWe have a manufacturing and development facility in Ireland where we manufacture Xyrem and development-stage oxybate products, including JZP-258, and a manufacturing plant in Italy where we produce the defibrotide drug substance. We currently do not have our own commercial manufacturing or packaging capability for our other products, product candidates or their APIs. As a result, our ability to develop and supply products in a timely and competitive manner depends primarily on third party suppliers being able to meet our ongoing commercial and clinical trial needs for API, other raw materials, packaging materials and finished products. For details of our arrangements with our suppliers, see \u201cBusiness-Manufacturing\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn part due to the limited market size for our products and product candidates, we have a single source of supply for most of our marketed products, product candidates and their APIs. We are the sole supplier of the defibrotide compound. We have a single source for sodium oxybate, the API for Xyrem, for Erwinaze, for the finished vial form of Defitelio and for Vyxeos. Single sourcing puts us at risk of interruption in supply in the event of manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties. There is no guarantee that our suppliers can or will continue to supply on a timely basis, or at all, the quantities of API or finished product that we need. If one of our suppliers fails or refuses to supply us for any reason, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to, and to qualify, a new supplier. The FDA and similar international regulatory bodies must approve manufacturers of the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and\ncertain packaging materials used in our products. The loss of one of our suppliers could require us to obtain regulatory clearance in the form of a \u201cprior approval supplement\u201d and to incur validation and other costs associated with the transfer of the API or product manufacturing process. We believe that it could take up to two years, or longer in certain cases, to qualify a new supplier, and we may not be able to obtain APIs or finished products from new suppliers on acceptable terms and at reasonable prices, or at all. If there are delays in qualifying new suppliers or facilities or a new supplier is unable to meet FDA\u2019s or similar international regulatory body\u2019s requirements for approval, there could be a shortage of the affected products for the marketplace or for use in clinical studies, or both, which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues and could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations with customers or to violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need.\nErwinaze is licensed from, and manufactured for us by, a single source, PBL. The Erwinaze BLA includes a number of post-marketing commitments related to the manufacture of Erwinaze by PBL.\nIn January 2017, the FDA issued a warning letter to PBL indicating that it was not satisfied with PBL\u2019s response to the FDA Form 483 issued to PBL in March 2016 and citing significant violations of cGMP for finished pharmaceuticals and significant deviations from cGMP for APIs. In March 2017, PBL filed a response to the warning letter with the FDA. In August 2018, the FDA conducted an inspection of the PBL manufacturing facility and issued an FDA Form 483 to PBL citing observations related to items referenced in the warning letter as well as other manufacturing practices, including data and records management. PBL continues to address the issues identified by the FDA in the warning letter and has submitted its response to the August 2018 Form 483.\nIn the United Kingdom, or UK, where PBL\u2019s manufacturing facilities are located, PBL is subject to similar inspections conducted by the MHRA. Following a site inspection of PBL by MHRA in December 2017, MHRA issued an inspection report listing several major findings, including major deficiencies and failures by PBL to comply with cGMP. In January 2018, PBL filed a response to the report with the MHRA.\nInability to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA, the MHRA or other competent authorities in the EU member states in which Erwinaze is subject to marketing authorization, including any failure by PBL to correct the violations and deviations referenced above to the satisfaction of the FDA and MHRA, could adversely affect Erwinaze supply, particularly in light of the ongoing limited supply of Erwinaze, and could result in enforcement actions by the FDA, MHRA or other EU member states\u2019 competent authorities (including the issuance of the local equivalents of FDA Form 483s or warning letters), the approval of the FDA or other competent authorities being suspended, varied, or revoked, product release being delayed or suspended, including potentially the FDA refusing admission of Erwinaze in the U.S., or product being seized or recalled. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our sales of, and revenues from, Erwinaze and further limit our future maintenance and potential growth of the market for this product. We have incurred and continue to incur significant internal and external costs and expenses as a result of these issues, including due to managing the increased need for regulatory and customer interaction. In addition, if the FDA or any non-U.S. regulatory authority mandates any changes to the specifications for Erwinaze, we may face challenges having product produced to meet such specifications, and PBL may increase its price to supply Erwinaze meeting such specifications, which may result in additional costs to us or a delay in supply and may decrease any profit we would otherwise achieve with Erwinaze.\nAll Erwinaze that PBL has been able to supply is currently completely absorbed by demand for the product. As a consequence, there is no product inventory that can be used to absorb supply disruptions resulting from quality, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues. PBL has experienced and continues to experience product quality and manufacturing issues that have resulted, and continue to result, in disruptions in our ability to supply markets from time to time and have caused, and may in the future cause, us to implement batch-specific, modified product use instructions. We cannot predict whether the required remediation activities by PBL in connection with its January 2017 FDA warning letter, the December 2017 MHRA report or the August 2018 FDA Form 483 will further strain PBL\u2019s manufacturing capacity or otherwise further adversely affect Erwinaze supply. As capacity constraints and supply disruptions continue, whether as a result of continued quality or manufacturing challenges at PBL, regulatory issues or otherwise, we will be unable to build product inventory, our ability to supply the market will continue to be compromised and physicians\u2019 decisions to use Erwinaze will continue to be negatively impacted.\nIf PBL\u2019s quality, manufacturing or regulatory issues persist and supply disruptions continue, our agreement with PBL only gives us the right to engage a backup supplier for Erwinaze in very limited circumstances, such as following termination of the agreement by us due to uncured material breach or the cessation of manufacturing by our supplier. If we are required to engage a backup or alternative supplier, the transfer of technical expertise and manufacturing process to the backup or alternative supplier would be difficult, costly and time-consuming, might not be successful and would increase the likelihood of a delay or disruption in manufacturing or exacerbate the supply shortage. If we continue to fail to obtain a sufficient supply of Erwinaze from PBL, our sales of and revenues from Erwinaze, our future maintenance and potential growth of the market for this product, our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would continue to be materially adversely affected.\nThe API in Defitelio is derived from porcine DNA. If our porcine DNA supplier experiences safety or other issues that impact its ability to supply porcine materials to us as needed, we may not be able to find alternative suppliers in a timely fashion, which could negatively impact our supply of Defitelio.\nVyxeos is manufactured by Baxter Oncology GmbH, or Baxter, which is a sole source supplier from a single site location. Given that our Vyxeos launch is at an early stage, there is limited experience with the complex manufacturing process relating to Vyxeos. Baxter manufactured batches that were used in the Phase 3 clinical trial for Vyxeos; there have since been batch failures due to mechanical, component and other issues, and batches have been produced that have otherwise not been in compliance with applicable specifications. We are continuing to work with Baxter to address manufacturing complexities. Moreover, the proprietary technology that supports the manufacture of Vyxeos is not easily transferable. Consequently, engaging an alternate manufacturer may be difficult, costly and time-consuming. If we fail to obtain a sufficient supply of Vyxeos in accordance with applicable specifications on a timely basis for any reason or due to manufacturing or regulatory challenges, our sales of and revenues from Vyxeos, our future maintenance and potential growth of the market for this product, our ability to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of Vyxeos, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, while the APIs in Vyxeos, daunorubicin and cytarabine, are available from a number of suppliers, certain suppliers have received warning letters from the FDA. As a result, we have qualified other suppliers for each API, and we provided the qualification data to the FDA. If the FDA restricts importation of API from either supplier, and we are unable to qualify API from additional suppliers in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to successfully commercialize Vyxeos and generate sales of this product at the level we expect and to conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of Vyxeos could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo conduct our ongoing and any future clinical trials of, complete marketing authorization submissions for, and potentially launch our other product candidates, we need to have sufficient quantities of product manufactured. For example, Siegfried USA, LLC, or Siegfried, is currently our sole supplier of both the API and finished product for our development activities involving solriamfetol, and we expect that Siegfried will manufacture and supply solriamfetol drug product for commercial sale if solriamfetol receives regulatory approval. If Siegfried does not or is not able to supply us with solriamfetol for any reason, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another provider, and such delay could negatively impact our anticipated revenues from solriamfetol.\nWe or our suppliers may not be able to produce sufficient supplies of our product candidates in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable specifications. If any of our suppliers fail or refuse to comply with their obligations to us under our supply and manufacturing arrangements, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we or our supplier or suppliers for that product must obtain approval by the FDA to manufacture and supply product, in some cases based on qualification data provided to the FDA as part of our NDA submission. Any delay in generating, or failure to generate, data required in connection with submission of the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, portions of any NDA could negatively impact our ability to meet our anticipated submission dates, and therefore our anticipated timing for obtaining FDA approval, or our ability to obtain FDA approval at all. In addition, any failure of us or a supplier to obtain approval by the FDA to manufacture and supply product or any delay in receiving, or failure to receive, adequate supplies of a product on a timely basis or in accordance with applicable specifications could negatively impact our ability to successfully launch and commercialize products and generate sales of products at the levels we expect.\nOur manufacturing facilities and manufacturing facilities of our suppliers have been and are subject to periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, the DEA, the Italian Health Authority and other regulatory authorities, including state authorities and similar authorities in other jurisdictions, to confirm compliance with cGMP and other requirements. We and our third party suppliers must continually expend time, money and effort in production, recordkeeping and quality assurance and control to ensure that our products and product candidates meet applicable specifications and other requirements for product safety, efficacy and quality. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements subjects us and our suppliers to possible legal or regulatory action, including restrictions on supply or shutdown, which may adversely affect our or a supplier\u2019s ability to supply the ingredients or finished products we need. Moreover, our or our third party suppliers\u2019 facilities could be damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunication and information system failure, terrorism or similar events. Any of these events could cause a delay or interruption in manufacturing and potentially a supply shortage of our products, which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues.\nRisks Related to Growth of Our Product Portfolio and Research and Development\nOur future success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain and maintain regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe for our late-stage product candidates and, if approved, to successfully launch and commercialize those product candidates.\nIn furtherance of our growth strategy, we have made and are making significant investments in a number of product candidates, including solriamfetol and JZP-258. Our inability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates in the U.S. and Europe, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize new products would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nSolriamfetol\nWe are seeking approval in the U.S. and Europe for solriamfetol as a treatment to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy or OSA. The FDA accepted our solriamfetol new drug application, or NDA, for filing with a standard review in early 2018 and the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date is March 20, 2019. We submitted a solriamfetol marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2018. We cannot predict whether our NDA or MAA will be approved in a timely manner, or at all, or, in the case of our NDA for solriamfetol, the results of labeling discussions with the FDA. If we fail to obtain approval for solriamfetol in the U.S. and EU, or if the FDA or EC requires product labeling that negatively impacts patient, physician or payor acceptance of the product, our growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIf approved, solriamfetol will face competition from existing and future products that treat EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy or OSA in a competitive retail pharmacy market of branded and generic products. In particular, we will need to successfully differentiate solriamfetol from other branded and generic treatments for EDS in patients with narcolepsy with which physicians are more familiar, including stimulants, wake-promoting agents, such as Provigil and Nuvigil, and generic versions of stimulants and wake-promoting agents. We are also aware that stimulants and wake-promoting agents are prescribed for patients to treat excessive sleepiness in OSA. Solriamfetol, if approved by the FDA, will likely face competition from this genericized market. In addition, we are aware of several other products in development as potential treatments for excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy or OSA, including, for example, pitolisant, mazindol, modafinil combinations and Avadel\u2019s once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation.\nIn addition to uncertainties related to obtaining regulatory approval of solriamfetol and potential competition, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in solriamfetol is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following as well as other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Part I, Item 1A:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully launch and grow sales of any approved solriamfetol product in the U.S. and EU;\n\u2022\npotential launch delays after any approval, including due to the need for DEA scheduling review which will need to be completed after NDA approval, if any, but before commercial launch;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate formulary positions and pricing and adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payors, including government programs, including the impact of any delays in coverage decisions by payors;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on permitted promotional activities based on limitations on the approved labeling for the product required by the FDA or the EC;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance for an approved solriamfetol product, particularly by OSA physicians;\n\u2022\ndelays or problems in the supply or manufacture of an approved solriamfetol product; and\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy post-marketing commitments and requirements, if any, imposed by the FDA in connection with its approval of our NDA and by the EC in connection with its marketing authorization.\nIf sales of an approved solriamfetol product do not reach the levels we expect, or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for solriamfetol in a timely manner, or at all, our anticipated revenue from an approved solriamfetol product will be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nJZP-258\nJZP-258 is an oxybate product candidate that contains 90% less sodium than Xyrem. Given the well-accepted relationship between dietary sodium and blood pressure as well as published hypertension guidelines, we believe that lower sodium intake would be beneficial for patients. We have conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial of JZP-258 in patients for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy and are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia, a chronic neurological disorder that is primarily characterized by EDS. Subject to the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial in narcolepsy, we expect to submit an NDA to the FDA for JZP-258 by as early as the end of 2019. Any failure or delay in successfully completing necessary clinical trials and conducting other activities, including CMC activities, that are required to complete our planned NDA submission and obtain regulatory approval could materially and adversely affect our growth prospects.\nAvadel has announced that it has obtained an orphan drug designation from the FDA for its once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. To obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, Avadel will have to show clinical superiority to Xyrem, or, if applicable, clinical superiority to JZP-258. However, if the FDA approves Avadel\u2019s product and grants it orphan drug exclusivity before we obtain approval for JZP-258, there is a risk that JZP-258 will not be approvable for seven years unless it can establish clinical superiority to Avadel\u2019s product. We cannot predict the timing of the two submissions or how FDA will evaluate any clinical superiority arguments that either company may make, but a delay in our ability to obtain approval for JZP-258, if at all, could be detrimental to our business.\nFor a discussion of the risks inherent in product development and regulatory approval, see the discussions in the risk factors under the headings \u201cConducting clinical trials is costly and time-consuming, and the outcomes are uncertain. A failure to prove that our product candidates are safe and effective in clinical trials, or to generate data in clinical trials to support expansion of the therapeutic uses for our existing products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects\u201d and \u201cThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our partners from obtaining and maintaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A. If we are not successful in the clinical development of these and other future product candidates, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, or if sales of an approved product do not reach the levels we expect, our anticipated revenue from our product candidates would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates to grow our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nIn addition to continued investment in our research and development pipeline, we intend to grow our business by acquiring or in-licensing, and developing, additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential. Future growth through acquisition or in-licensing will depend upon the availability of suitable products and product candidates for acquisition or in-licensing on acceptable prices, terms and conditions.\nEven if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to successfully identify them, or we may not have the financial resources necessary to pursue them. Other companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources, compete with us for these opportunities. In order to compete successfully to acquire attractive products or product candidates in the current business climate, we may have to pay higher prices for assets than may have been paid historically, which may make it more difficult for us to realize an adequate return on any acquisition.\nEven if we are able to successfully identify and acquire, in-license or develop additional products or product candidates, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products or product candidates into our portfolio or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing. We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including if:\n\u2022\nwe are unable to obtain and maintain adequate funding to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize an acquired product candidate;\n\u2022\na product candidate proves not to be safe or effective in later clinical trials;\n\u2022\na product fails to reach its forecasted commercial potential as a result of pricing pressures or for any other reason;\n\u2022\nwe experience negative publicity regarding actual or potential future price increases for that product or otherwise; or\n\u2022\nthe integration of a product or product candidate gives rise to unforeseen difficulties and expenditures.\nAny failure to identify and manage these risks and uncertainties effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, product and product candidate acquisitions create other uncertainties and risks, particularly when the acquisition takes the form of a merger or other business consolidation. Our business acquisitions have required, and any similar future transactions will also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to transition activities and integrating the acquired business with our historical business. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with potential acquisitions and similar transactions, which include:\n\u2022\nhigh acquisition costs;\n\u2022\nthe need to incur substantial debt or engage in dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our historical core business;\n\u2022\nthe strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain key managers and other personnel;\n\u2022\nthe challenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of any acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe need to write down assets or recognize impairment charges;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to integration of operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures; and\n\u2022\nany unanticipated liabilities for activities of or related to the acquired business or its operations, products or product candidates.\nIf any of these or other factors impair our ability to integrate or otherwise manage an acquired business efficiently and successfully, we may be required to spend time or money on integration activities that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of our business. Resulting operating inefficiencies could increase costs and expenses more than we planned, could negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares and could otherwise distract us from the execution of our strategy. Failure to maintain effective financial controls and reporting systems and procedures during and after integration of an acquired business could also impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements.\nConducting clinical trials is costly and time-consuming, and the outcomes are uncertain. A failure to prove that our product candidates are safe and effective in clinical trials, or to generate data in clinical trials to support expansion of the therapeutic uses for our existing products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a condition to regulatory approval, each product candidate must undergo extensive and expensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate to a statistically significant degree that the product candidate is safe and effective. The results at any stage of the development process may lack the desired safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetic characteristics. Results of limited preclinical studies, including studies in animal models, may not predict the results of human clinical trials. Similarly, results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later and larger clinical trials, and later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy of our product candidates despite successful initial clinical testing. Even if we believe we have successfully completed testing, the FDA or any equivalent non-U.S. regulatory agency may determine our data is not sufficiently compelling to warrant marketing approval and may require us to engage in additional clinical trials or provide further analysis which may be costly and time-consuming. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials. If a product candidate fails at any stage of development or the data is otherwise not sufficient for regulatory approval, we will not be able to commercialize it and receive any return on our investment in that product candidate.\nIf the FDA determines that our safety or efficacy data for solriamfetol or, after NDA submission, JZP-258 do not warrant marketing approval, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, which could be costly and time-consuming, or we may not be able to commercialize solriamfetol or JZP-258, in which event we would not receive any return on our investments in these product candidates. The FDA may also require product labeling that negatively impacts patient, physician or payor acceptance of the product. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading \u201cOur future success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain and maintain regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe for our late-stage product candidates and, if approved, to successfully launch and commercialize those product candidates\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nAny adverse events or other data generated during the course of clinical trials of our product candidates and/or clinical trials related to additional indications for our commercialized products could result in action by the FDA or a non-U.S. regulatory agency, which may restrict our ability to sell, or adversely affect sales of, currently marketed products, or such events or other data could otherwise have a material adverse effect on a related commercial product, including with respect to its safety profile. Any failure or delay in completing such clinical trials could materially and adversely affect the maintenance and growth of the markets for the related marketed products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and overall growth prospects.\nIn addition to issues relating to the results generated in clinical trials, clinical trials can be delayed or halted for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying or enrolling eligible patients, often based on the number of clinical trials, particularly in hematology and oncology, with enrollment criteria targeting the same patient population;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial because of safety concerns of regulators relating to our product candidates or similar product candidates of our competitors or failure to follow regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining clinical materials and manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product candidate for use in trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective study sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocol from an institutional review board, known as an ethics committee in Europe, to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective study site;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in recruiting patients to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nfailure of our clinical trials and clinical investigators to be in compliance with the FDA and other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements, commonly referred to as good clinical practices;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u2022\ndifficulty monitoring multiple study sites;\n\u2022\nfailure of our third party clinical trial managers to satisfactorily perform their contractual duties, comply with regulations or meet expected deadlines; or\n\u2022\ninsufficient funds to complete the trials.\nWe rely on contract research organizations and other third parties, such as cooperative groups, to assist us in designing, coordinating, managing, monitoring and otherwise conducting clinical trials with our product candidates. If we, contract research organizations assisting us with clinical trials, other third parties conducting clinical trials with our product candidates, or our trial sites fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices, the clinical data generated in these clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA and/or other global regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar regulations outside of the U.S. Our failure, or the failure of our product suppliers, to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat or redesign clinical trials, which would delay the completion of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process.\nIf third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, including dosing requirements, or regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements. If our clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or generate additional clinical data in support of these products.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us or our partners from obtaining and maintaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nWe are not permitted to market a pharmaceutical product in the U.S. or in the EU member states until we receive approval from the FDA, the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states, as applicable. Submission of an application for marketing authorization does not assure approval for marketing in any jurisdiction, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain approval to market products.\nAlthough PDUFA provides a ten-month deadline for the FDA to review a new drug application, or a six-month deadline for priority review, there is no guarantee that the FDA will meet that deadline, and the FDA can extend a PDUFA action date under certain circumstances. If the FDA fails to meet PDUFA targeted action dates established for any of our product candidates, the commercialization of the affected product candidate could be delayed or impaired. In the first quarter of 2018, the FDA accepted our NDA for solriamfetol for filing with a standard review. In December 2018, the FDA determined that a submission we made during the course of discussions regarding draft labeling for solriamfetol constituted a major amendment to the NDA, resulting in a three-month extension of the PDUFA goal date to March 20, 2019, to provide time for a full review of the submission. However, if the FDA fails to meet the PDUFA target action date for our solriamfetol NDA submission, requires significant labeling restrictions as described below or requires product labeling that negatively impacts patient, physician or payor acceptance of the product, our ability to commercialize solriamfetol in the U.S. could be delayed or impaired. We also submitted an MAA to the EMA in November 2018 for solriamfetol as a treatment to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) or OSA. We cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain approval of our NDA for solriamfetol in the U.S. or our marketing authorization in the EU in a timely manner and on what terms, or at all.\nMoreover, the redemption of a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher may not result in faster review or approval compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by FDA. Any delay or failure in obtaining approval of a product candidate, or receipt of approval for narrower indications than sought, can have a negative impact on our ability to recoup or research and development costs and to successfully commercialize that product and on our financial performance.\nIf the FDA, the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states determine that our quality, safety or efficacy data do not warrant marketing approval, we could be required to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to receiving approval, which could be costly and time-consuming and could delay the approval of our application.\nEven if we receive approval, it may be subject to significant labeling restrictions, including limitations on the dosing of the product, indicated uses for which we may market the product, or other warnings and precautions, such as the requirement for a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks or the imposition of a boxed warning included in the\nlabeling for the product. A boxed warning is the strongest type of warning that the FDA can require for a drug product and warns prescribers that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or even life-threatening adverse effects. The FDA requires a REMS and a boxed warning for Xyrem, and similar restrictions could be imposed on other products in the future.\nRegulatory authorities may also impose post-marketing obligations as part of their approval. Post-marketing obligations may lead to additional costs and burdens associated with commercialization of the drug, and may pose a risk to maintaining approval of the drug. We are subject to certain post-marketing requirements and commitments in connection with the approval of certain of our products, including Erwinaze, Defitelio and Vyxeos. For example, for Defitelio, in the U.S. the FDA imposed several post-marketing commitments and requirements in connection with its approval, including the requirement that we conduct a clinical trial to analyze the safety of defibrotide versus best supportive care in the prevention of VOD in adult and pediatric patients, and in the EU marketing authorization was granted under exceptional circumstances and requires us to comply with a number of post-marketing obligations, including a study to provide further data on long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio in normal use. Similarly, the FDA imposed post-marketing requirements in connection with its approval of our NDA for Vyxeos, including the requirement that we conduct a safety study to characterize infusion-related reactions in patients treated with Vyxeos and a clinical trial to determine dosing to minimize toxicity in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, and the marketing authorization in the EU also requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments. In the event that we are unable to comply with our post-marketing obligations imposed as part of the marketing approvals in the U.S. or EU, our approval may be varied, suspended or revoked, product supply may be delayed and our sales of and revenues from our products could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK is derived from EU laws. For that reason, the results of the formal procedure of withdrawal from the EU, initiated by the UK in March 2017, could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to our operations, including with respect to the approval of our product candidates, as there is significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. For a further discussion, see the risks under the heading \u201cThe UK\u2019s planned withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining, maintaining and defending intellectual property protection for our products and product candidates, including protection of their use and methods of manufacturing and distribution. Our ability to protect our products and product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importation by third parties depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or have adequately protected trade secrets that cover these activities.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex and often changing legal, regulatory and factual questions. The degree of protection to be afforded by our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nour patent applications, or those of our licensors or partners, may not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or therapeutically equivalent products without infringing our patents, or those of our licensors, such as products that are not covered by the claims of our patents, or for which we do not have adequate exclusive rights under our license agreements;\n\u2022\nour issued patents, or those of our licensors or partners, may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties or may be vulnerable to legal challenges as a result of changes in applicable law;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or partners might not have been the first to invent or file, as appropriate, subject matters covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or those of our licensors or partners;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may manufacture products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or that have a different scope of patent protection or that do not respect our patents; or\n\u2022\nothers may be issued patents that prevent the sale of our products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties.\nWe have patents covering many of our products in Europe and other parts of the world where patent laws operate differently and provide a different scope of protection than in the U.S. For example, in the EU, approval of a generic pharmaceutical product can occur independently of whether the reference brand product is covered by patents, and enforcement of such patents generally must await approval and an indication that the generic product is being offered for sale. Patent enforcement generally must be sought on a country-by-country basis, and issues of patent validity and infringement may be judged differently in different countries.\nWe own a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications and have licensed rights to a number of issued patents and patent applications that cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including Xyrem, Defitelio, Vyxeos and solriamfetol. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Even if we are able to obtain patents covering our products and product candidates, any patent may be challenged, and potentially invalidated or held unenforceable, including through patent litigation or through patent office procedures that permit challenges to patent validity. Patents can also be circumvented, potentially including by FDA approval of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that avoids infringement of our intellectual property.\nXyrem is covered by patents covering its manufacture, formulation, distribution system and method of use, and we have U.S. patents that extend to 2033. We have settled patent litigation with nine companies seeking to introduce generic versions of Xyrem in the U.S. by granting those companies licenses to launch their generic products in advance of the expiration of the last of our patents. Notwithstanding our patents and settlement agreements, additional third parties may also attempt to introduce generic versions of Xyrem or other sodium oxybate products for treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy that design around our patents or assert that our patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. If these efforts are successful, then that third party could launch a generic or 505(b)(2) product referencing Xyrem before the dates provided in our patents or settlement agreements.\nFor example, we have several method of use patents listed in the FDA\u2019s publication \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d or the Orange Book, that expire in 2033 that cover instructions on the Xyrem package insert and Xyrem REMS related to a drug-drug interaction, or DDI, with divalproex sodium. Although the FDA has stated, in granting a Citizen Petition we submitted in 2016, that it would not approve any sodium oxybate ANDA referencing Xyrem that does not include the portions of the currently approved Xyrem package insert related to the DDI patents, we cannot predict whether a future ANDA filer, or a company that files a Section 505(b)(2) application for a drug referencing Xyrem, may pursue regulatory strategies to avoid infringing our DDI patents notwithstanding the FDA\u2019s response to the Citizen Petition, or whether any such strategy would be successful. Likewise, we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain the validity of these patents or will otherwise obtain a judicial determination that a generic or other sodium oxybate product, its package insert or the generic sodium oxybate REMS or another separate REMS will infringe any of our patents or, if we prevail in proving infringement, whether a court will grant an injunction that prevents a future ANDA filer or other company introducing a different sodium oxybate product from marketing its product, or instead require that party to pay damages in the form of lost profits or a reasonable royalty.\nSince Xyrem\u2019s regulatory exclusivity has expired in the EU, we are aware that generic or hybrid generic applications have been approved by various EU regulatory authorities, and additional generic or hybrid generic applications may be submitted and approved. We cannot predict whether our licensee in the EU will be able to enforce our existing European patents against generic or hybrid generic filers in the EU.\nFor a discussion regarding the risks associated with our ANDA litigation settlement agreements, the potential launch of AG Products or other generic versions of Xyrem, or the approval and launch of other sodium oxybate or other products that compete with Xyrem, as well as other risks and challenges we face with respect to Xyrem, see the risk factors under the headings \u201cRisks Related to Xyrem and the Our Other Marketed Products\u201d and \u201cWe have incurred and may in the future incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents, other intellectual property rights and related matters, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or commercialize, our products\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our products and their commercial position, particularly with respect to our products with limited or no patent protection, such as Erwinaze, which has no patent protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in part through confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and partners. Nevertheless, our employees, consultants, advisors and partners may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors, and we may not have adequate remedies for such disclosures. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained or is using any of our inventions or trade secrets would be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside of the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIn some instances, we also rely on regulatory exclusivity to protect our commercial position. In addition to relying on trade secret protection, Erwinaze was granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in the U.S. for a seven-year period from its FDA approval, which had precluded approval of another product with the same principal molecular structure for the same indication until November 2018. As a biologic product approved under a BLA, Erwinaze is also subject to the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. We believe that Erwinaze is protected by exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the BPCIA. However, interpretation of regulatory exclusivity under the BPCIA may evolve over time based on FDA issuance of guidance documents, proposed regulations or decisions made by the FDA in the course of considering specific applications. In addition, the BPCIA exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to Erwinaze, generating all the\ndata necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. BPCIA exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDA\u2019s prior approvals of Erwinaze to support the biosimilar product\u2019s approval. As a result, it is possible that a potential competing drug product might obtain FDA approval before the expected BPCIA exclusivity period has expired, which would adversely affect sales of Erwinaze. In the EU, the regulatory data protection that provides an exclusivity period for Erwinase has lapsed. Any new marketing authorizations for Erwinase in other EU member states will not receive any regulatory data protection. If a biosimilar product to Erwinaze is approved as interchangeable to Erwinaze in the U.S. or in other countries where Erwinaze is sold, a significant percentage of the prescriptions that would have been written for Erwinaze may be filled with the biosimilar version, resulting in a loss in sales of Erwinaze, and there may be a decrease in the price at which Erwinaze can be sold. Competition from a biosimilar product to Erwinaze could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur research and development collaborators may have rights to publish data and other information to which we have rights. In addition, we sometimes engage individuals or entities to conduct research that may be relevant to our business. While the ability of these individuals or entities to publish or otherwise publicly disclose data and other information generated during the course of their research is subject to contractual limitations, these contractual provisions may be insufficient or inadequate to protect our trade secrets and may impair our patent rights. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication, or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our innovations and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be jeopardized. Moreover, a dispute may arise with our employees, consultants, advisors or partners over the ownership of rights to inventions, including jointly developed intellectual property. Such disputes, if not successfully resolved, could lead to a loss of rights and possibly prevent us from pursuing certain new products or product candidates.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents, other intellectual property rights and related matters, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or commercialize, our products.\nOur ability, and that of our partners, to commercialize any approved products will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, enforce those patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from infringing our patents, our licensed patents or our partners\u2019 patents, that third party has the right to ask the court or an administrative agency to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced. These lawsuits and administrative proceedings are expensive and consume time and other resources, and we may not be successful in these proceedings or in stopping infringement. In addition, the inter partes review, or IPR, process under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act permits any person, whether they are accused of infringing the patent at issue or not, to challenge the validity of certain patents. As a result, many types of entities, including ANDA filers, have challenged valuable pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process, and six of our Orange Book-listed patents for Xyrem were invalidated through this process.\nThere is a risk that a court or the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, could decide that our patents or certain claims in our patents are not valid or infringed, and that we do not have the right to stop a third party from using the inventions covered by those claims, as happened with the decision of the PTAB that certain of our patent claims covering the Xyrem REMS are invalid. In addition, even if we prevail in establishing that another product infringes a valid claim of one of our patents, a court may determine that we can be compensated for the infringement in damages, and refuse to issue an injunction. As a result, we may not be entitled to stop another party from infringing our patents for their full term. For more information, see the risk factors under the headings \u201cRisks Related to Xyrem and Our Other Marketed Products\u201d and \u201cIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A. Lawsuits or proceedings we may file in the future, or our defense against any lawsuits or other proceedings that may be brought against us, may not costly and time-consuming and may not be successful in stopping the infringement of our patents.\nLitigation involving patent matters is frequently settled between the parties, rather than continuing to a court ruling, and we have settled patent litigation with all nine Xyrem ANDA filers. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, certain types of agreements between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the settlement of patent litigation or the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs violate the antitrust laws and has commenced investigations and brought actions against some companies that have entered into such agreements. In particular, the FTC has expressed its intention to take aggressive action to challenge settlements that include an alleged transfer of value from the brand company to the generic company (so-called \u201cpay for delay\u201d patent litigation settlements) and to call on legislators to pass stronger laws prohibiting such settlements. Because there is currently no precise legal standard with respect to the lawfulness of such settlements, there could be extensive litigation over whether any settlement that we have entered into or might enter into in the future constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S. are required by law to file the agreements with the FTC and the U.S Department of Justice, or DOJ, for review. Accordingly, we have submitted our ANDA litigation settlement agreements to the FTC and the DOJ for review. We may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC regarding our ANDA litigation settlements, and there is a risk that the FTC may commence a\nformal investigation or action against us, or a third party may initiate civil litigation regarding such settlements, which could divert the attention of management and cause us to incur significant costs, regardless of the outcome. Any claim or finding that we or our business partners have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations could be costly to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nA third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights, or that we or such partners are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating other intellectual property rights, and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. Such lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of management and development personnel. There is a risk that a court could decide that we or our partners are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third party patent or other intellectual property rights, which could be very costly to us and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry, like other industries, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, which we may not be able to do.\nBecause some patent applications in the U.S. may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the U.S. and many non-U.S. jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after their priority date, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for inventions covered by our or our licensors\u2019 issued patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensors were the first inventors.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent and other intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. For further discussion of our Xyrem-related patent matters, see the risk factors under the headings \u201cRisks Related to Xyrem and Our Other Marketed Products\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\u201d and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies-Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have substantially expanded our international footprint and operations, and we may expand further in the future, which subjects us to a variety of risks and complexities which, if not effectively managed, could negatively affect our business.\nWe are headquartered in Dublin, Ireland and have multiple offices in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Italy and other countries in Europe. Our headcount has grown to approximately 1,360 as of February 2019. This includes employees in 15 countries in North America and Europe, a European commercial presence, a complex distribution network for products in Europe and additional territories, and manufacturing facilities in Italy and Ireland. We may further expand our international operations into other countries in the future, either organically or by acquisition. While we have management and other personnel with substantial international experience, conducting our business in multiple countries subjects us to a variety of risks and complexities that may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. These risks and complexities include:\n\u2022\nthe diverse regulatory, financial and legal requirements in the countries where we are located or do business, including those related to data security and the use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, taxation, trade laws, including tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions, and any changes to those requirements;\n\u2022\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing employees in diverse geographies, including the need to adapt systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs to differing labor and employment law and other regulations, as well as maintaining positive interactions with our unionized employees;\n\u2022\ncosts of, and liabilities for, our international operations, products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency rates.\nIn addition, as a result of our international expansion, our business and corporate structure has become substantially more complex. Significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of our company, and there can be no guarantee that we will effectively manage the increased complexity without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe UK\u2019s planned withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nBrexit has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU, particularly if the UK withdraws from the EU without a ratified withdrawal agreement in place. From a regulatory perspective, there is uncertainty about which laws and regulations will apply. A significant portion of the regulatory framework in the UK is derived from EU laws. However, it is unclear which EU laws the UK will decide to replace or replicate in connection with its withdrawal from the EU. In particular, the regulatory regime applicable to our operations, including with respect to the approval of our product candidates, may change, potentially significantly, and the impact on the process for obtaining or maintaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the UK is otherwise unknown.\nA basic requirement related to the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is the requirement that the applicant be established in the EU. Following withdrawal of the UK from the EU, marketing authorizations previously granted to applicants established in the UK through the centralized, mutual recognition or decentralized procedures may no longer be valid. Moreover, depending upon the exact terms of the UK's withdrawal, there is a risk that the scope of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product granted by the EC pursuant to the centralized procedure, or by the competent authorities of other EU member states through the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, would not encompass the UK. In that circumstance, a separate authorization granted by the UK competent authorities would be required to place medicinal products on the UK market.\nIn addition, the laws and regulations that will apply after the UK withdraws from the EU may have implications for manufacturing sites that hold certifications issued by the UK competent authorities. Our capability to rely on these manufacturing sites for products intended for the EU market will depend on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and, potentially, on the ability to obtain relevant exemptions under EU law to supply the EU market with products manufactured at UK-certified sites. There is also the risk that if batch release and quality control testing sites for our products are located only in the UK, manufacturers will need to use sites in other EU member states. All of these changes, if they occur, could increase our costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nBrexit has also given rise to calls for the governments of other EU member states to consider withdrawal from the EU. These developments, or the perception that they could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, including by significantly reducing global market liquidity or restricting the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. In addition, currency exchange rates for the British Pound and the euro with respect to each other and to the U.S. dollar have already been negatively affected by Brexit. Should this foreign exchange volatility continue or be exacerbated by UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results.\nWe have an office in Oxford, England which is focused on commercialization of our products outside of the U.S. We do not know to what extent, or when, the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU or any other future changes to membership in the EU will impact our business, particularly our ability to conduct international business from a base of operations in the UK. The UK could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, possibly resulting in increased trade barriers, which could make doing business in Europe more difficult and/or costly. Moreover, in the U.S., tariffs on certain U.S. imports have recently been imposed, and the EU and other countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. exports. We cannot predict what effects these and potential additional tariffs will have on our business, including in the context of escalating global trade and political tensions. However, these tariffs and other trade restrictions, whether resulting from the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU or otherwise, could increase our cost of doing business, reduce our gross margins or otherwise negatively impact our financial results.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and motivate key personnel or to retain the members of our executive management team, our operations and our future growth may be adversely affected.\nOur success and our ability to grow depend in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. We are highly dependent upon our executive management team and other critical personnel, all of whom work on many complex matters that are essential to our success. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance. The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team or other key personnel could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our vital activities. Any employee may terminate his or her employment at any time without notice or with only short notice and without cause or good reason. The resulting loss of institutional knowledge may negatively impact our operations and future growth.\nIn addition, to grow our company we will need additional personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate quality individuals, including in our research and development operations, which are continuing to expand, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe also depend on the unique abilities, industry experience and institutional knowledge of the members of our board of directors to efficiently set company strategy and effectively guide our executive management team. We cannot be certain that future board turnover will not negatively affect our business.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or data security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. We have also outsourced some of our operations (including parts of our information technology infrastructure) to a number of third party vendors who may have, or could gain, access to our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties, in turn, subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties.\nOur information technology systems are large and complex and store large amounts of confidential information. The size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in frequency, persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. In addition to the extraction of important information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information. Although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nSignificant disruptions of our, our third party vendors\u2019 and/or business partners\u2019 information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant legal and financial exposure. In addition, security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may further harm us. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices to access confidential information increases the risk of security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nIn addition to those specifically described in other risk factors, we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nFDA and Equivalent Non-U.S. Regulatory Authorities\nOur activities are subject to extensive regulation encompassing the entire life cycle of our products, from research and development activities to marketing approval (including specific post-marketing obligations), manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event and safety reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, pricing and reimbursement, recordkeeping, distribution, importing and exporting. These requirements apply both to us and to third parties we contract with to perform services and supply us with products. The failure by us or any of our third party partners, including clinical trial sites, suppliers, distributors and our central pharmacy for Xyrem, to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions or other negative consequences, such as delays in approval or refusal to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products, our suppliers, our other partners or us, the withdrawal, suspension or variation of product approval, untitled letters, warning letters, fines and other monetary penalties, unanticipated expenditures, product recall, withdrawal or seizure, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution, any of which could result in a significant drop in our revenues from the affected products and harm to our reputation and could have a significant impact on our sales, business and financial condition.\nWe monitor adverse events resulting from the use of our products, as do the regulatory authorities, and we file periodic reports with the authorities concerning adverse events. The authorities review these events and reports, and if they determine\nthat any events and/or reports indicate a trend or signal, they can require a change in a product label, restrict sales and marketing and/or require or conduct other actions, potentially including withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market, any of which could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The FDA and the competent authorities of the EU member states on behalf of the EMA also periodically inspect our records related to safety reporting. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on FDA Form 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. The EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee may propose to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that the marketing authorization holder be required to take specific steps or advise that the existing marketing authorization be varied, suspended or revoked. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action, which could include the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures. The failure to adequately address and promptly correct any matters identified by the FDA or other regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nErwinase, defibrotide and Vyxeos are available on a named patient basis in many countries where they are not commercially available. If any such country\u2019s regulatory authorities determine that we are promoting such products without proper authorization, we could be found to be in violation of pharmaceutical advertising laws or the regulations permitting sales under named patient programs. In that case, we may be subject to financial or other penalties. Moreover, any failure to maintain revenues from sales of Erwinase, defibrotide and/or Vyxeos on a named patient basis and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of these products exceeding historical sales on a named patient basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe FDA, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other governmental authorities require advertising and promotional labeling to be truthful and not misleading, and products to be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Regulatory authorities actively investigate allegations of off-label promotion in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. If we are found to have promoted an approved product for off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative financial penalties and other remedies as well as criminal financial penalties, other sanctions and imprisonment. Even if we are not determined to have engaged in off-label promotion, an allegation that we have engaged in such activities could have a significant impact on our sales, business and financial condition. The U.S. government has also required companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that impose significant reporting and other burdens on the affected companies. Failure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could subject us to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.\nIn the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are also subject to EU member states\u2019 laws governing promotion of medicinal products, including limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals, advertising and promotion of our products to the general public, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.\nOther Regulatory Authorities\nWe are also subject to regulation by other regional, national, state and local agencies, including the DEA, the DOJ, the FTC, the United States Department of Commerce, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of the HHS and other regulatory bodies, as well as similar governmental authorities in those non-U.S. countries in which we commercialize our products.\nWe are subject to numerous anti-fraud and abuse laws and regulations globally and our sales, marketing, patient support and medical activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute is broad and activities that involve providing anything of value to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical products may be subject to scrutiny. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices or arrangements that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not clearly qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. While we maintain a comprehensive compliance program to try to ensure that our practices and the activities of our third-party contractors and employees fall within the scope of such exceptions and safe harbors, regulators and enforcement agencies may disagree with our assessment or find fault with the conduct of our employees or contractors. In addition, existing regulations are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the DOJ or OIG. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute may be punished by civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\nThe federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, making a fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds or a false statement to get a false claim paid. The government may assert that a claim resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. Many companies have faced government investigations or lawsuits by whistleblowers who bring a qui tam action under the False Claims Act on behalf of themselves and the government for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers expecting that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, providing consulting fees, grants, free travel and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products, and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug reimbursement rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, the government and private whistleblowers have pursued False Claims Act cases against pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. If we become the subject of a government False Claims Act or other investigation or whistleblower suit, we could incur substantial legal costs (including settlement costs) and business disruption responding to such investigation or suit, regardless of the outcome. Violations of the False Claims Act may result in significant financial penalties (on a per claim or statement basis), treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.\nThe majority of individual states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and the False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nThe Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Sunshine provisions, currently requires us to track and report to the federal government payments and transfers of value that we make to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests held by physicians and their family, and provides for public disclosures of these data. Public reporting under the Sunshine provisions has resulted in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, teaching hospitals and physicians. Such scrutiny may negatively impact our ability to engage with physicians on matters of importance to us. In addition, government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports. For example, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and gifts and payments to individual physicians, and/or restrict when and to what extent pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities. If the data reflected in our reports are found to be in violation of any of the Sunshine provisions or any other U.S. federal, state or local laws or regulations that may apply, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the Sunshine provisions or similar requirements of state or local regulators, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages or fines.\nOutside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the EU, is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU member states, as described below. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Certain EU member states require that payments made to physicians be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nXyrem is a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Our suppliers, distributors, clinical sites and the central pharmacy for Xyrem are subject to DEA and state regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures, including limitations on prescription refills, and are required to maintain DEA registration and state licenses, when handling Xyrem and its API. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA, relevant state authorities or any comparable international requirements could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, fines, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties, could result in, among other things, additional operating costs to us or delays in shipments outside or into the U.S. and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. DEA quotas are required for any U.S. supplier to manufacture sodium oxybate or Xyrem. New oxybate market entrants, including generic products, may impact the amount of quota available in the U.S., and if, our suppliers cannot obtain the quotas that are needed on a timely basis, or at all, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect that solriamfetol will be subject to scheduling review under the CSA before it can be commercially launched. For a further discussion on controlled substance regulations, see the discussion under the heading \u201cBusiness-Government\nRegulation-Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation-Controlled Substance Regulations\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have various programs to help patients access our products, including patient assistance programs, which include co-pay coupons for certain of our products, services that help patients determine their insurance coverage for our products, and a free product program. Co-pay coupon programs for commercially insured patients, including our program for Xyrem, have received negative publicity related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. In the past, payors brought class action lawsuits challenging the legality of manufacturer co-pay programs under a variety of federal and state laws and insurers have taken actions through their network pharmacies and PBMs to restrict manufacturer co-pay programs. In September 2014, the OIG issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and other laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Medicare Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, including Xyrem, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and financial condition.\nWe have established programs to consider grant applications submitted by independent charitable organizations, including organizations that provide co-pay support to patients who suffer from the diseases treated by our drugs. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor\u2019s product. If we or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, such facts could be used as the basis for an enforcement action against us by the federal government.\nIn 2016 and 2017, we received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to our support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In April 2018, we reached an agreement in principle with the DOJ on a proposal for a civil settlement of potential claims by the DOJ in the amount of $57.0 million, subject to accrual of interest on the settlement amount from the date of the agreement in principle, negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement and other contingencies. We expect any such settlement will involve entry into a corporate integrity agreement, which will impose significant costs and operational burdens on our business. Moreover, a failure to comply with the terms of a corporate integrity agreement could result in monetary penalties or a reduction or elimination of coverage for our products by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and state health care programs. If we do not reach a final settlement, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate and enter into a corporate integrity agreement, the outcome of this investigation could include an enforcement action against us. If the federal government were to file an enforcement action against us as a result of the investigation and could establish the elements of a violation of relevant laws, we could be subject to damages, fines and penalties, which could be substantial, along with other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. We would expect to incur significant costs in connection with any enforcement action, regardless of the outcome.\nWe may also become subject to similar investigations by other state or federal governmental agencies or offices. Any additional investigations of our patient assistance programs or other business practices may result in damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. Such investigations may also result in negative publicity or other negative actions that could harm our reputation, impact our business practices, reduce demand for, or patient access to, our products and/or reduce coverage of our products, including by federal health care programs and state health care programs. If any or all of these events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the UK Bribery Act. Our heavily regulated business involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in certain countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act. Recently the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, private individuals who report original information to the SEC that leads to successful enforcement actions may be eligible for a monetary award. There is no certainty that all employees and third party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors, and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of suppliers and other third party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result\nin civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues which may affect our business. Failure to comply with current and future laws and regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that will become effective beginning January 2020, could result in government enforcement actions (including the imposition of significant penalties), criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business. If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon for the transfer of personal data are ever deemed inadequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, although we are not directly subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we potentially could be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nUnder the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, agreements between branded pharmaceutical companies and potential generic competitors settling patent litigation must be submitted to the FTC and the DOJ for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, certain brand-generic settlement agreements violate the antitrust laws and has brought actions against some companies that have entered into such agreements. In particular, the FTC has expressed its intention to take aggressive action to challenge settlements that include an alleged transfer of value from the brand company to the generic company (so-called \u201cpay for delay\u201d patent litigation settlements) and to call on legislators to pass stronger laws prohibiting such settlements. Because there is currently no precise legal standard with respect to the lawfulness of such settlements, there could be extensive litigation over whether any settlement that we have entered into or might enter into in the future constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement. We may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC regarding our Xyrem patent settlements, and there is a risk that the FTC may commence a formal investigation or action against us, or a third party may initiate civil litigation regarding such settlements, which could divert the attention of management and cause us to incur significant costs, regardless of the outcome. We cannot predict the outcome of any potential government investigation of any antitrust claims, including those described above, or the impact of any such claims.\nIn addition to those described in this and other risk factors, numerous federal, state and non-U.S. statutes and regulations govern the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information, promotion, marketing, and pricing to government purchasers and government healthcare programs. Any claim or finding that we or our business partners have failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations could be costly to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines.\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental programs are described under the heading \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our failure to comply with these obligations could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Healthcare Reform Act. The issuance of the final regulation, as well as any other regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, has increased and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if CMS challenges the approach we take in our implementation of the final regulation.\nWe also participate in the 340B program, which is described in more detail under the heading \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally\novercharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. Implementation of this regulation could affect our obligations and potential liability under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. HRSA also began to implement a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B program during the first quarter of 2019. There is no guarantee that our submissions will not be found by HRSA to be incomplete or incorrect. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.\nWe have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program, as described in more detail under the heading \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. In the case of our Medicaid pricing data, if we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products under the 340B program.\nCivil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, or if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. There is no guarantee that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nWe participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program and the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, as described in more detail under the heading \u201cBusiness-Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with price reporting under these programs can subject a manufacturer to civil monetary penalties. These program obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements.\nIf we overcharge the government in connection with our arrangements with FSS or Tricare, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.\nShareholder activism, which takes many forms and arises in a variety of situations, has been increasingly prevalent. If we become the subject of certain forms of shareholder activism, such as proxy contests, the attention of our management and our board of directors may be diverted from execution of our strategy. Such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future strategy, adversely affect our relationships with business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may incur substantial costs, including significant legal fees and other expenses, related to activist shareholder matters. Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.\nProduct liability and product recalls could harm our business.\nThe development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls. Side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with, or manufacturing defects in, the products sold by us could exacerbate a patient\u2019s condition, or could result in serious injury or impairment or even death. This could result in product liability claims against us and/or recalls of one or more of our products. In many countries, including in EU member states, national laws provide for strict (no-fault) liability which applies even where damages are caused both by a defect in a product and by the act or omission of a third party.\nProduct liability insurance coverage is expensive, can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Our product liability insurance may not cover all of the future liabilities we might incur in connection with the development, manufacture or sale of our products. In addition, we may not continue to be able to obtain\ninsurance on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts. A successful claim or claims brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Such claims could also harm our reputation and the reputation of our products, adversely affecting our ability to market our products successfully. In addition, defending a product liability lawsuit is expensive and can divert the attention of key employees from operating our business.\nProduct recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of our suppliers, government agencies and other entities that have regulatory authority for pharmaceutical sales. Any recall of our products could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell that product for some time and by adversely affecting our reputation. A recall could also result in product liability claims by individuals and third party payors. In addition, product liability claims could result in an investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs conducted by the FDA, the EMA, or the competent authorities of the EU member states. Such investigations could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, limitations on the therapeutic indications for which they may be used, or suspension, variation, or withdrawal of approval. Any such regulatory action by the FDA, the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states could lead to product liability lawsuits as well.\nWe use hazardous materials in our manufacturing facilities, and any claims relating to the improper handling, storage, release or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming and expensive.\nOur operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, in Italy and Ireland where we have manufacturing facilities. Environmental and health and safety authorities in Italy and Ireland administer laws governing, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Our manufacturing facilities are involved in the controlled storage, use and disposal of chemicals and solvents. Even if our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by EU laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from hazardous materials. If an accident occurs, an injured party could seek to hold us liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. In certain cases, laws may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste or any migration of such hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with current or future EU environmental laws.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Results\nWe have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1.8 billion, which included $651.0 million in outstanding term loan indebtedness under a secured credit agreement that we entered into in June 2015 and subsequently amended in July 2016 and in June 2018, which we refer to as the amended credit agreement, $575.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under our 1.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes, which were issued in August 2014, and $575.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under our 1.50% exchangeable senior notes due 2024, or the 2024 Notes, which were issued in August 2017 and which we refer to, together with the 2021 Notes, as the Exchangeable Senior Notes.\nOur debt may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nresult in dilution to our existing shareholders in the event exchanges of the Exchangeable Senior Notes are settled in our ordinary shares;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or restructure all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can assure you that we would be able to do in a timely manner, or at all.\nCovenants in our amended credit agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe amended credit agreement provides for a $667.7 million principal amount term loan due in June 2023 and a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility, with any loans under such revolving credit facility due in June 2023, subject to early mandatory repayments under certain circumstances. The amended credit agreement contains various covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\nissue redeemable preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments, acquisitions (including acquisitions of exclusive licenses) and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nThe amended credit agreement also includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the covenants under the amended credit agreement could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the amended credit agreement, which could permit the lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility. A default under the amended credit agreement could also lead to a default under other debt agreements or obligations, including the indentures governing the Exchangeable Senior Notes.\nIn addition, the holders of the Exchangeable Senior Notes have the ability to require us to repurchase their notes for cash if we undergo certain fundamental changes, such as specified change of control transactions, our liquidation or dissolution, or the delisting of our ordinary shares from The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Moreover, upon exchange of the Exchangeable Senior Notes, unless we elect to deliver only our ordinary shares to settle such exchange, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. It is our intent and policy to settle the principal amount of the Exchangeable Senior Notes in cash upon exchange. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make any required repurchases of surrendered Exchangeable Senior Notes or to pay cash upon exchanges of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. Our failure to repurchase the Exchangeable Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indentures governing the Exchangeable Senior Notes or to pay any cash payable on future exchanges of the Exchangeable Senior Notes as required by the indentures governing the Exchangeable Senior Notes would constitute a default under that indenture. A default under those indentures could also lead to a default under other debt agreements or obligations, including the amended credit agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the related indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our business. In this regard, if we are unable to repay amounts under the amended credit agreement, the lenders under the amended credit agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our future financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of positive cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The amended credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of\nassets, use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate or obtain proceeds from such dispositions, and any such proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIn addition, our borrowings under the amended credit agreement are, and are expected to continue to be, at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.\nTo continue to grow our business, we will need to commit substantial resources, which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe scope of our business and operations has grown substantially since 2012 through a series of transactions, including the business combination between Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Azur Pharma Public Limited Company, which we refer to as the Azur Merger, and our acquisitions of EUSA Pharma Inc., Gentium S.r.l. and Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To continue to grow our business over the longer term, we will need to commit substantial additional resources to our business and execution of our strategy. Our ongoing capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe revenues from our commercial products, which may be affected by many factors, including the extent of competition for Xyrem or our other products;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquiring and/or in-licensing any new products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of our commercial operations;\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our development and clinical activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals and of compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of investigations, litigation and/or settlements related to regulatory oversight and third party claims;\n\u2022\nthe costs of integration activities related to any future strategic transactions we may engage in; and\n\u2022\nthe costs arising from changes in laws and regulations, including, for example, healthcare reform legislation.\nOur strategy includes the expansion of our business through acquiring or in-licensing, and developing, additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential. See the risk factor under the heading \u201cWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates to grow our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions\u201d in this Part I, Item 1A. We may be unable to expand our business if we do not have sufficient capital or cannot borrow or raise additional capital on attractive terms. Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds for acquisitions or to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future acquisitions. In addition, if we use a substantial amount of our funds to acquire or in-license products or product candidates, we may not have sufficient additional funds to conduct all of our operations in the manner we would otherwise choose.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nDuring the past several years, domestic and international financial markets have experienced extreme disruption from time to time, including, among other things, high volatility and significant variability in stock prices, which has caused uncertainty with regard to credit availability for many borrowers. We expect to opportunistically seek access to the capital and credit markets to supplement our existing cash balances, cash we expect to generate from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements or to continue to grow our business over the longer term through product acquisition and in-licensing, product development and clinical trials of product candidates, and expansion of our commercial operations. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, including as a result of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU or as a result of tariffs and other trade restrictions potentially contributing to instability in the global financial markets, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing or credit on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects. Changes in our credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nWe have significant intangible assets and goodwill. Consequently, the future impairment of our intangible assets and goodwill may significantly impact our profitability.\nOur intangible assets and goodwill are significant. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded $3.7 billion of intangible assets and goodwill related to our past acquisitions. Intangible assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For example, in connection with entry into an asset purchase agreement in June 2018 to sell substantially all of the assets held by us related to Prialt\u00ae (ziconotide) intrathecal infusion, we recognized an impairment charge of $42.9 million in our consolidated statements of income in 2018, primarily related to the carrying balances of intangible assets. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually.\nEvents giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of intangible assets or goodwill occur.\nOur financial results have been and may continue to be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have significant operations in Europe as well as in the U.S., but we report revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars. Our primary currency translation exposure relates to our subsidiaries that have functional currencies denominated in the euro. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate from period to period. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. To the extent that revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. For example, because our Defitelio and Erwinase product sales outside of the U.S. and potential future sales of Vyxeos are or will be primarily denominated in the euro, our sales of those products have been and may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In this regard, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against a foreign currency, the relative value of sales made in the foreign currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against a foreign currency, the relative value of such sales increases. Accordingly, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, primarily the euro, could adversely affect our foreign revenues, perhaps significantly. In addition, as we continue to expand our international operations, we will conduct more transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which could increase our foreign currency exchange risk. Given the volatility of exchange rates, as well as our expanding operations, there is no guarantee that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage currency risk primarily related to certain intercompany balances denominated in non-functional currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedges. Gains and losses on these derivative instruments are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying balance sheet exposures. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain our tax rates, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and maintain subsidiaries in North America and a number of other foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions where we operate. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the distribution of our profits or losses between the jurisdictions where we operate and differences in interpretation of tax laws. In addition, the tax laws of any jurisdiction in which we operate may change in the future, which could impact our effective tax rate. We are subject to reviews and audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Services, or IRS, and other taxing authorities from time to time, and the IRS or other taxing authority may challenge our structure, transfer pricing arrangements and tax positions through an audit or lawsuit. Responding to or defending against challenges from taxing authorities could be expensive and consume time and other resources. If we are unsuccessful, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could require us to reduce our operating expenses, decrease efforts in support of our products or seek to raise additional funds. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn December 2015, we received proposed tax assessment notices, and, in October 2018, we received revised tax assessment notices from the French tax authorities for 2012 and 2013 and in December 2018, we received a proposed tax assessment notice for 2015, relating to certain transfer pricing adjustments. The notices propose additional French tax of approximately $43 million for 2012 and 2013 and approximately $4 million for 2015, including interest and penalties through the respective dates of the proposed assessments, translated at the foreign exchange rate at December 31, 2018. We disagree with the proposed assessments and are contesting them vigorously.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or U.S. Tax Act, was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. The U.S. Department of Treasury has issued limited regulations and other interpretive guidance under the U.S. Tax Act, and is expected to issue additional guidance, the impact of which is uncertain but could change the financial impacts that were recorded at December 31, 2018 or are expected to be recorded in future periods. Furthermore, the impact of this tax reform on certain holders of our ordinary shares could be adverse. Among other things, changes to the rules for determining a foreign corporation\u2019s status as a controlled foreign corporation could have an adverse effect on U.S. persons who are treated as owning (directly or indirectly) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our ordinary shares. Investors should consult their own advisers regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments.\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Because we indirectly acquired all of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s assets through the acquisition of the shares of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. common stock in the Azur Merger, the IRS could assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874. The IRS continues to scrutinize transactions that are potentially subject to Section 7874, and has issued several sets of final and temporary regulations under Section 7874 since 2012. We do not expect these regulations to affect the U.S. tax consequences of the Azur Merger. Nevertheless, new statutory and/or regulatory provisions under Section 7874 of the Code or otherwise could be enacted that adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and any such provisions could have prospective or retroactive application to us, our shareholders, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and/or the Azur Merger.\nOur U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to use their net operating losses to offset potential taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is limited under Section 7874 of the Code and could be subject to further limitations if we do not generate taxable income in a timely manner or if the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code result in further annual limitations.\nFollowing certain acquisitions of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions. Based on the limited guidance available, this limitation applies to us. Our U.S. affiliates have a significant amount of NOLs. As a result of Section 7874 of the Code, after the Azur Merger, our U.S. affiliates have not been able and will continue to be unable, for a period of time, to utilize their U.S. tax attributes to offset their U.S. taxable income, if any, resulting from certain taxable transactions. While we expect to be able to fully utilize our U.S. affiliates\u2019 U.S. NOLs prior to their expiration, as a result of this limitation, it may take our U.S. affiliates longer to use their NOLs.\nOur ability to use these NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is also dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the NOLs, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, our U.S. affiliates will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of the NOLs. In addition, the use of NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to annual limitations under the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and similar state provisions, which may result in the expiration of additional NOLs before future utilization.\nFuture changes to the tax laws under which we expect to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes or to other tax laws relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect us.\nThe U.S. Congress, the EU, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is the OECD\u2019s initiative in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. Some countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the OECD\u2019s recommendation. As a result of the focus on the taxation of multinational corporations, the tax laws in Ireland, the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates based on USD LIBOR and certain of our financial contracts are also indexed to USD LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, in the U.S. has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to the U.S. dollar, or USD, LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as relating to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD LIBOR. We have certain financial contracts, including the amended credit agreement and our interest rate swaps, that are indexed to USD LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative\nreference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness. Any transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. We are monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks, and any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR may result in increased expenses, may impair our ability to refinance our indebtedness or hedge our exposure to floating rate instruments, or may result in difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price of our ordinary shares has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe market price for our ordinary shares has fluctuated significantly from time to time, for example, varying between a high of $184.00 on June 20, 2018 and a low of $113.52 on December 24, 2018 during 2018. The market price of our ordinary shares is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors, including the risk factors described above. The stock market in general, including the market for life sciences companies, has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the market for life sciences companies. These broad market and industry factors have harmed, and in the future may seriously harm, the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance.\nOur share price may be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts\u2019 forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. Our ability to meet analysts\u2019 forecasts, investors\u2019 expectations and our financial guidance is substantially dependent on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our marketed products. The risks and uncertainties associated with our ability to maintain or increase sales of our products include those discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market or significant price decline, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, the market price of our ordinary shares may decline if the effects of our transactions, including the Celator Acquisition and/or potential future acquisitions, on our financial or operating results are not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors. The market price of our ordinary shares could also be affected by possible sales of our ordinary shares by holders of the Exchangeable Senior Notes who may view the Exchangeable Senior Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our ordinary shares by the holders of the Exchangeable Senior Notes.\nWe are subject to Irish law, which differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nIt may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction.\nOur articles of association, Irish law and the indentures governing the Exchangeable Senior Notes contain provisions that could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nOur articles of association could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares. For example, our articles of association:\n\u2022\nimpose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nstagger the terms of our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of a supermajority of the voting power of the shares of our share capital entitled to vote generally at a meeting of shareholders to amend our articles of association; and\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred shares with rights and preferences, as our shareholders may determine by ordinary resolution.\nIn addition to our articles of association, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For example, Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent, and the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ from those in the U.S., and in some cases are greater, under Irish law. We are also subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances. Furthermore, the indentures governing the Exchangeable Senior Notes require us to repurchase the Exchangeable Senior Notes for cash if we undergo certain fundamental changes and, in certain circumstances, to increase the exchange rate for a holder of 2021 Notes or 2024 Notes. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Exchangeable Senior Notes and/or increase the exchange rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquiror to engage in a business combination transaction with us.\nThese provisions, whether alone or together, may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our ordinary shares at a premium over the market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our ordinary shares. These provisions, whether alone or together, could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOther than funds we have allocated for the purposes of supporting our share repurchase program, we anticipate that we will retain all earnings, if any, to support our operations and our proprietary drug development programs, acquire or in-license additional products and product candidates, and pursue other opportunities. If we propose to pay dividends in the future, we must do so in accordance with Irish law, which provides that distributions including dividend payments, share repurchases and redemptions be funded from \u201cdistributable reserves.\u201d In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on or repurchase our ordinary shares is restricted under the terms of the amended credit agreement. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will, subject to Irish legal requirements, be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with the terms of the amended credit agreement and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, holders of our ordinary shares must rely on increases in the trading price of their shares for returns on their investment in the foreseeable future. In addition, in the event that we pay a dividend on our ordinary shares, in certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.\nA transfer of our ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty.\nIn certain circumstances, the transfer of shares in an Irish incorporated company will be subject to Irish stamp duty, which is a legal obligation of the buyer. This duty is currently charged at the rate of 1.0% of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher. Because our ordinary shares are traded on a recognized stock exchange in the U.S., an exemption from this stamp duty is available in respect of transfers by shareholders who hold our ordinary shares beneficially through brokers which in turn hold those shares through the Depository Trust Company, or DTC, to holders who also hold through DTC. However, a transfer by or to a record holder who holds our ordinary shares directly in his, her or its own name could be subject to this stamp duty. We, in our absolute discretion and insofar as the Irish Companies Act 2014 or any other applicable law permits, may, or may provide that a subsidiary of ours will, pay Irish stamp duty arising on a transfer of our ordinary shares on behalf of the transferee of such ordinary shares. If stamp duty resulting from the transfer of our ordinary shares which would otherwise be payable by the transferee is paid by us or any of our subsidiaries on behalf of the transferee, then in those circumstances, we will, on our behalf or on behalf of our subsidiary (as the case may be), be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement of the stamp duty from the transferee, (ii) set-off the stamp duty against any dividends payable to the transferee of those ordinary shares and (iii) claim a first and permanent lien on the ordinary shares on which stamp duty has been paid by us or our subsidiary for the amount of stamp duty paid. Our lien shall extend to all dividends paid on those ordinary shares.", "PERMNO": 92096, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "JAZZ"}
