RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks below were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to IEA\nOur business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers, exposing us to variable quarterly results.\nSome of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the calendar year. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the fall and winter seasons, can also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of North America. As a result, we generally experience reduced revenue in the first quarter of each calendar year. Natural catastrophes such as hurricanes or other severe weather could also have a negative effect on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur 2018 results reflect the effect of multiple severe weather events on the Company's wind business that began late in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter. These weather conditions had a significant impact on the construction of six wind projects across South Texas, Iowa, and Michigan, resulting in additional labor, equipment and material costs as well as change orders. IEA is aggressively pursuing the collection of all amounts it is contractually owed due to weather-related delays, including collections on change orders resulting from force majeure provisions of certain customer\ncontracts, which generally compensate for the actual costs of weather-related delays. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of weather impact.\nOur failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns or a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays, changes from the initial project scope and adverse conditions, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect, or from project or contract terminations. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial results.\nOur business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments, which could cause delays and/or increase our costs and reduce profitability.\nWe perform work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, challenging and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions. Performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially causing us to incur additional, unanticipated costs, reductions in revenue or the payment of liquidated damages. In addition, some of our contracts require that we assume the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected. Some of our projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases, which may occur over extended time periods. We may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and material delivery delays, schedule changes, delays from customer failure to timely obtain rights-of-way, weather-related delays, delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, but which affect our ability to complete a project as originally scheduled. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of such costs. Any such delays or cancellations or errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project. Delays or cancellations could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts and our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur failure to properly manage projects, or project delays, may result in additional costs or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCertain of our engagements involve large-scale, complex projects that may occur over extended time periods. The quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones. Additionally, delays on a particular project, including delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from a customer\u2019s failure to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or to meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays, permitting delays, governmental, market, political and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in the cancellation or deferral of project work, which could lead to a decline in revenue from lost project work, or, for project deferrals, could cause us to incur costs which are not reimbursable by the customer, and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date.\nIn addition, some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines; therefore, any failure to properly estimate or manage cost or delays in the completion of projects, could subject us to penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers\u2019 expectations could result in damage claims against us, and because of the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-times necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects, damage claims may substantially exceed the\namount we can charge for our associated services.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which could trigger events of default that could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate requirements, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to increased interest expense related to our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under our credit facility;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and\n\u2022\npreventing us from paying dividends.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, and some of these activities may be on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nOur credit facility imposes restrictions on us that may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of defaults and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders. The restricted actions include, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaking unfinanced capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nengaging in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nbuying back shares or paying dividends in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\nmaking investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;\n\u2022\ncreating certain liens against our assets;\n\u2022\nprepaying subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengaging in certain mergers or combinations;\n\u2022\nfailing to satisfy certain financial tests; and\n\u2022\nengaging in transactions that would result in a \u2018\u2018change of control.\u2019\u2019\nOur credit facility requires that we comply with a consolidated first lien leverage ratio. Should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility, we would be required to obtain consents from our bank group, further modify our credit facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business, none of which may be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. A default could also result in the acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility. To the extent we need additional financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms, which may materially decrease our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings, and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our replacement credit facility.\nSome of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. If we are not able to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, we may be precluded from being able to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral security in connection with the bonds, which would only be obtainable if we have sufficient availability under our replacement credit facility and, if available, would reduce availability for borrowings under our facility. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral at any time. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that require bonding.\nOur failure to comply with the regulations of OSHA and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u2018\u2018OSHA\u2019\u2019) and various recordkeeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards and safety in excavation and demolition work, may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of business in complying with OSHA and other state and local laws and regulations, and could incur penalties and fines in the future, including, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions.\nWhile we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability. Although we have taken what we believe to be appropriate precautions, we have had employee injuries in the past, and may suffer additional injuries in the future. Serious accidents of this nature may subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Personal injury claims for damages, including for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate, or if we suffered substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur business is subject to physical hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition.\nConstruction projects undertaken by us expose our employees to heavy equipment, mechanical failures, transportation accidents, adverse weather conditions and the risk of damage to equipment and property. These hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims which could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services. In addition, if serious accidents or fatalities occur, or if our safety records were to deteriorate, we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining new contracts and certain existing contracts could be terminated. Our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and ratings bureaus.\nThe occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities, employee turnover, increase the costs of our projects, or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new customer contracts, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur experience modification rate, a measure of our history and safety record as compared to other businesses in our industry, was 0.61 and our total recordable incident rate was 1.29 in 2018, both of which were significantly below the industry averages of 1.0 and 2.8, respectively, reported by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2017. While these standards are still below industry averages, the Company experienced a fatality at one of our work sites in 2018 and there is no guarantee, based on the hazards discussed above, that we can maintain these averages.\nWe are self-insured against certain potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer\u2019s liability, general liability, auto and workers compensation claims, those policies are subject to deductibles or self-insured retention amounts of up to $500,000 per occurrence. We are primarily self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible/self-insured retention. In addition, for our employees not part of a collective bargaining agreement, we provide employee health care benefit plans. Our primary health insurance plan is subject to a deductible of $100,000 per individual claim per year.\nOur insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice. If we fail to comply with these requirements, our coverage could be denied.\nLosses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends.\nAcquisition activity presents certain risks to our business, operations and financial position, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of a transaction.\nWe expect that the acquisitions will be an important part of our long-term growth strategy. Successful execution following the closing of an acquisition is essential to achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction. We have made acquisitions to expand into new markets and our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to complete and integrate the acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, and any mergers and acquisitions that we complete may not be successful. The process of integrating an acquired company\u2019s business into our operations and investing in new technologies is challenging and may result in expected or unexpected operating or compliance challenges, which may require significant expenditures and a significant amount of our management\u2019s attention that would otherwise be focused on the ongoing operation of our business. The potential difficulties or risks of integrating an acquired company\u2019s business include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic positions and our reputation;\n\u2022\nrisk that we fail to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022\nrisk that we are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including synergies or economies of scale;\n\u2022\nrisk that we are unable to complete development and/or integration of acquired technologies;\n\u2022\nrisk that the market does not accept the integrated product portfolio;\n\u2022\nchallenges in reconciling business practices or in integrating product development activities, logistics or information technology and other systems;\n\u2022\nchallenges in reconciling accounting issues, especially if an acquired company utilizes accounting principles different from those we use;\n\u2022\nretention risk with respect to key customers, suppliers and employees and challenges in retaining, assimilating and training new employees;\n\u2022\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or\nchallenges of an acquired company, which could result in unexpected litigation, regulatory exposure, financial contingencies and known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in complying with newly applicable laws and regulations, including obtaining or retaining required approvals, licenses and permits.\nOur acquisitions may also result in the expenditure of available cash and amortization of expenses any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. Investments in immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies have an especially high degree of risk, with the possibility that we may lose the value of our entire investments or incur additional unexpected liabilities. Large or costly acquisitions or investments may also diminish our capital resources and liquidity or limit our ability to engage in additional transactions for a period of time. All of the foregoing risks may be magnified as the cost, size or complexity of an acquisition or acquired company increases, or where the acquired company\u2019s products, market or business are materially different from ours, or where more than one integration is occurring simultaneously or within a concentrated period of time.\nIn addition, in the future we may require significant financing to complete an acquisition or investment, whether through bank loans, raising of debt or otherwise. We cannot assure you that such financing options will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to obtain such necessary financing, it could have an impact on our ability to consummate a substantial acquisition or investment and execute our growth strategy. Alternatively, we may issue a significant number of shares as consideration for an acquisition, which would have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nOur business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees are trained in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficiently skilled labor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor and training expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may not be able to pass these expenses on to our customers, which could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor or training costs, or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe U.S. wind and solar industries benefit from tax and other economic incentives and political and governmental policies. A significant change in these incentives and policies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (\u2018\u2018CAA\u2019\u2019) extended certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which contains federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry. Currently, the tax code provides that the production tax credit for wind projects (the \u2018\u2018PTC\u2019\u2019) applies to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date was prior to January 1, 2020. The PTC was reduced by 20% for 2017, has been reduced by 40% for 2018, and finally will be reduced by 60% for 2019. Similarly, a phase down rate of the investment tax credit (the \u2018\u2018ITC\u2019\u2019) in lieu of PTC is available for wind projects: 30% ITC for projects commencing before 2017, 24% for projects commencing in 2017, 18% for projects commencing in 2018 and 12% for projects commencing in 2019. Solar projects, however, will be eligible for an investment tax credit (the \u2018\u2018Solar ITC\u2019\u2019) only. The Solar ITC is 30% for projects commencing prior to 2020 and is reduced to 26% for projects commencing in 2020 and to 22% for projects commencing in 2021. After 2021, the Solar ITC will permanently remain at 10% for projects that commence prior to 2022, but are placed in service after 2023.\nThe PTC, ITC, Solar ITC and cash grant program provide material incentives to develop wind energy generation facilities and thereby impact the demand for our manufactured products and services. The increased demand for our products and services resulting from the credits and incentives may continue until such credits or incentives lapse. The failure of Congress to extend or renew these incentives beyond their current expiration dates could significantly delay the development of wind energy generation facilities and the demand for wind turbines, towers and related components. In addition, we cannot assure you that any subsequent extension or renewal of the PTC, ITC, Solar ITC or cash grant program would be enacted prior to its expiration or, if allowed to expire, that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect. It is possible that these federal incentives will not be extended beyond their current expiration dates. Any delay or failure to extend or renew the PTC, ITC, Solar ITC or cash grant program in the future could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, results of operations, financial performance and future development efforts.\nState renewable energy portfolio standards generally require state-regulated electric utilities to supply a certain proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of their plant capacity to renewable energy generation. Typically, subject utilities comply with such standards by qualifying for renewable energy credits evidencing the share of electricity that was produced from renewable sources. Under many state standards, these renewable energy credits can be unbundled from their associated energy and traded in a market system allowing generators with insufficient credits to meet their applicable state mandate. These standards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our manufactured products. Currently, the majority of states and the District of Columbia have renewable energy portfolio standards in place and certain states have voluntary utility commitments to supply a specific percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. The enactment of renewable energy portfolio standards in additional states or any changes to existing renewable energy portfolio standards, or the enactment of a federal renewable energy portfolio standard or imposition of other greenhouse gas regulations may impact the demand for our products. We cannot assure you that government support for renewable energy will continue. The elimination of, or reduction in, state or federal government policies that support renewable energy could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits. Our backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and therefore is an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nOur backlog consists of the estimated amount of services to be completed from future work on uncompleted contracts or work that has been awarded with contracts still being negotiated. It also includes revenue from change orders and renewal options. Most of our contracts are cancelable on short or no advance notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer, or for other reasons, could significantly reduce the revenue that we actually receive from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog.\nBacklog amounts are determined based on target price estimates that incorporate historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and from communications with our customers. These estimates may prove inaccurate, which could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work due to changes in our customers\u2019 spending plans, as well as on construction projects, due to market volatility, regulatory and other factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers\u2019 requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable. If our backlog fails to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delay paying us for the related services.\nWe use subcontractors to perform portions of our services. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. We could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity if we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers that fail to pay, or delay paying us, for the related work.\nOur subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these relationships, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe depend on subcontractors to perform work on some of our projects. There is a risk that we may have disputes with subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they perform, customer concerns about our subcontractors, or our failure to extend existing work orders or issue new work orders under a subcontracting arrangement. If any of our subcontractors fails to deliver the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. In addition, the absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have satisfactory relationships could adversely affect our ability to perform under some of our contracts or the quality of the services we provide. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe also rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials for certain projects, and on equipment manufacturers and\nlessors to provide us with the equipment we require to conduct our operations. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier or equipment manufacturer or lessor, any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers or equipment could negatively affect our operations. Market and economic conditions could contribute to a lack of available suppliers or equipment. If we cannot acquire sufficient materials or equipment, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nMany of our customers are regulated by federal and state government agencies, and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact demand for our services and the profitability of those services.\nMany of our energy customers are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, and our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions. These agencies could change the way in which they interpret the application of current regulations and/or may impose additional regulations. Interpretative changes or new regulations having an adverse effect on our customers and the profitability of the services they provide could reduce demand for our services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAny future restrictions or regulations which might be adopted could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs for our customers in the wind industry that could result in reduced capital spending and/or delays or cancellations of future wind infrastructure projects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and to address violations of or liabilities under these requirements.\nOur operations and products are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and sell products governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, soil and groundwater contamination, employee health and safety, and product content, performance and packaging. We cannot guarantee that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws and regulations and if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or our permitting and other requirements, we may be required to pay fines or be subject to other sanctions. Also, certain environmental laws can impose the entire or a portion of the cost of investigating and cleaning up a contaminated site, regardless of fault, upon any one or more of a number of parties, including the current or previous owner or operator of the site. These environmental laws also impose liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at a contaminated site. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of sites and users of disposal sites for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous substances from those sites.\nChanges in existing environmental laws and regulations, or their application, could cause us to incur additional or unexpected costs to achieve or maintain compliance. The assertion of claims relating to on- or off-site contamination, the discovery of previously unknown environmental liabilities, or the imposition of unanticipated investigation or cleanup obligations, could result in potentially significant expenditures to address contamination or resolve claims or liabilities. Such costs and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with services provided under fixed price contracts, which could impair our financial performance.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, we typically set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that certain costs associated with our performance may be greater than what we estimated. In addition, we enter into contracts for specific projects or jobs that may require the installation or construction of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system, which are priced on a per unit basis. Profitability will be reduced if actual costs to complete each unit exceed our original estimates. If estimated costs to complete the remaining work for the project exceed the expected revenue to be earned, the full amount of any expected loss on the project is recognized in the period the loss is determined. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services and our ability to execute in accordance with our plans. A variety of factors affect these costs, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, may cause actual project revenue and profits to differ from original estimates. As a result, if actual costs exceed our estimates, we could have lower margins than anticipated, or losses, which could reduce our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe recognize revenue from installation/construction fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method; therefore, variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability.\nWe recognize revenue from fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, under which the percentage of revenue to be recognized in a given period is measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date on the contract to the total estimated costs for the contract. The percentage-of-completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis as the work progresses. Adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of contracts revenue or costs are reflected in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions, judgment and experience, but are subject to the risks inherent in estimates, including unanticipated delays or technical complications. Variances in actual results from related estimates on a large project, or on several smaller projects, could be material. The full amount of an estimated loss on a contract is recognized in the period that our estimates indicate such a loss. Such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability, which could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a concentrated base of customers, and the loss of a small number of our significant customers, or a reduction in their demand for our services, could impair our financial performance.\nOur business is concentrated among relatively few customers, and a significant proportion of our services are provided on a project-by-project basis. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer, our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose a small number of our significant customers, or if a few of our customers elected to perform the work that we provide with in-house service teams. In addition, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be negatively affected if our customers reduce the amount of business they provide to us, or if we complete the required work on non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. Many of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or no advance notice. Any of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.\nA drop in the price of energy sources other than solar or wind energy would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that a customer\u2019s decision to invest in solar or wind projects, as opposed to other forms of electric power generation, is to a significant degree driven by the levelized cost of energy production. Changes in technology or cost of commodities could lessen the appeal of wind-generated electricity and other renewables relative to other technologies for power generation. Similarly, government support for other forms of renewable or non-renewable power generation could make construction of wind and solar generating projects less attractive to customers economically. The ability of energy conservation technologies, public initiatives and government incentives to reduce electricity consumption could also lead to a reduction in the need for new generating capacity and in turn reduce demand for our services. If prices for electricity generated by wind or solar facilities are not competitive or demand for new production falls, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects may be materially harmed.\nIncreases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins.\nThe price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity because most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for such expenses.\nWe maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads. We could incur significant costs and reduced profitability from underutilization of our workforce if we do not receive future contract awards, if these awards are delayed, or if there is a significant reduction in the level of work we provide.\nOur estimates of future performance and results of operations depend on, among other factors, whether and when we receive new contract awards, which affect the extent to which we are able to utilize our workforce. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a variety of factors, including our ability to manage attrition, our ability to forecast our need for services, which allows us to maintain an appropriately sized workforce, our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new projects or between internal business groups, and our need to devote resources to non-chargeable activities such as training or business development. While our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment, these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information. In the case of large-scale\nprojects where timing is often uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award. The uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size to our contract needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits, indemnity or other claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of our business. These actions and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, liquidated damages, consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. We may also be subject to litigation involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties.\nClaimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. When appropriate, we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to developments. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8. We could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity if our legal reserves are inadequate, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or becomes unavailable, or our self-insurance liabilities are higher than expected. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits or proceedings, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the ultimate resolution of any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management\u2019s attention from our business or divert resources away from operating our business, and cause us to incur significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCertain of our businesses have employees who are represented by unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The use of a unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nCertain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements. Although all such collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur despite the terms of these agreements. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and cause us to lose business. Additionally, as current agreements expire, the labor unions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members, or at all, or avoid strikes, lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members. Therefore, it cannot be assured that new agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire, or on desirable terms. Any action against us relating to the union workforce we employ could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nSubstantially all of our union and collective bargaining agreements require us to participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. To the extent that U.S.-registered plans are underfunded defined benefit plans, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (collectively, \u2018\u2018ERISA\u2019\u2019), which governs U.S.-registered multiemployer pension plans, subjects employers to substantial liabilities upon the employer\u2019s complete or partial withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plans. Under current law pertaining to employers that are contributors to U.S.-registered multiemployer defined benefit plans, a plan\u2019s termination, an employer\u2019s voluntary withdrawal from, or the mass withdrawal of contributing employers from, an underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan requires participating employers to make payments to the plan for their proportionate\nshare of the multiemployer plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits of the plan for all plan participants, not only for benefits payable to participants of the contributing employer. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if the other participating employers cease to contribute to, or withdraw from, the plan. The allocable portion of liability to participating employers could be more disproportionate if employers that have withdrawn from the plan are insolvent, or if they otherwise fail to pay their proportionate share of the withdrawal liability. We currently contribute, and in the past have contributed to, plans that are underfunded, and, therefore, could have potential liability associated with a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from, or termination of, these plans. We currently do not have plans to withdraw from, and are not aware of related liabilities associated with these plans. However, there can be no assurance that we will not be assessed liabilities in the future. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u2018\u2018PPA\u2019\u2019) requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on their level of underfunding, under which benefit reductions may apply and/or participating employers could be required to make additional contributions. In addition, if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u2018\u2018IRS\u2019\u2019) may impose on the employers contributing to such a plan a non-deductible excise tax of 5% of the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency.\nBased upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of December 31, 2018, several of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate are underfunded and, as a result, we could be required to increase our contributions, including in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as these amounts are based on future levels of work of the union employees covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans.\nWithdrawal liabilities, requirements to pay increased contributions, and/or excise taxes in connection with any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur financial results are based, in part, upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Key estimates include: the recognition of revenue and project profit or loss, which we define as project revenue less project costs of revenue, including project-related depreciation, in particular, on long-term construction contracts or other projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, for which the recorded amounts require estimates of costs to complete projects, ultimate project profit and the amount of probable contract price adjustments; allowances for doubtful accounts; estimated fair values of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition-related contingent consideration, investments in equity investees; asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization; accrued self-insured claims; share-based compensation; other reserves and accruals; accounting for income taxes; and the estimated impact of contingencies and ongoing litigation. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to IEA\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities associated with our domestic operations and discontinued Canadian operations.\nWe are currently subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Management must exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes due to lack of clear and concise tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions. Tax laws may be changed or clarified and such changes may adversely affect our tax provisions. We are audited by various U.S. tax authorities and in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. In addition, we have certain ongoing audits and tax disputes with tax authorities in Canada. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we maintain appropriate reserves for our potential liability, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in our financial statements.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely\naffected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWarranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe generally warrant the work we perform for a two year period following substantial completion of a project, subject to further extensions of the warranty period following repairs or replacements. Historically, warranty claims have not been material, but such claims could potentially increase. If warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost, or, if our customers elect to repair or replace the warrantied item using the services of another provider, we could be required to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Additionally, while we generally require that the materials provided to us by suppliers have warranties consistent with those we provide to our customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not reimbursed. The costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty-related legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe rely on information, communications and data systems in our operations.\nSystems and information technology interruptions and/or breaches in our data security could adversely affect our ability to operate and our operating results or could result in harm to our reputation. We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. Our operations could be interrupted or delayed, or our data security could be breached, if we are unable to add software and hardware, effectively maintain and upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and/or take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, acts of war or terrorism, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions, including breaches by computer hackers and cyber-terrorists. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays and/or loss of critical data including private data, could delay or prevent operations, including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results, processing inefficiency, downtime, or could result in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information, which could adversely affect our operating results, harm our reputation and result in significant costs, fines or litigation. Similar risks could affect our customers and vendors, indirectly affecting us. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to IEA\u2019s Industry and its Customers\u2019 Industries\nEconomic downturns could reduce capital expenditures in the industries we serve, which could result in decreased demand for our services.\nThe demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the U.S. economy. During economic downturns, our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure, or may have difficulty obtaining financing for planned projects. In addition, uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets may reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers, causing them to reduce capital spending. This has resulted, and in the future could result, in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date. Such cancellations or deferrals could materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. These conditions could also make it difficult to estimate our customers\u2019 demand for our services and add uncertainty to the determination of our backlog.\nIn addition, our customers are negatively affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services. During an economic downturn, our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure or may outsource less work. A decrease in related project work could negatively impact demand for the services we provide and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur customers may be adversely affected by market conditions and economic downturns, which could impair their ability to pay for our services.\nSlowing conditions in the industries we serve, as well as economic downturns or bankruptcies within these industries, may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis. In difficult economic times, some of our clients may find it difficult to pay for our services on a timely basis, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it may be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay us on a timely basis or defaults in making payments on a project for which we have devoted significant resources, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nWe compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing and prospective customers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the services we provide. Additionally, organizations that have adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become a competitor. Most of our customers\u2019 work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, although management believes reliability is often more important to customers than price, price is often the principal factor that determines which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors sometimes win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements. Additionally, our bids for certain projects may not be successful because of a customer\u2019s perception of our relative ability to perform the work as compared to our competitors or a customer\u2019s perception of technological advantages held by our competitors as well as other factors. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding for projects or renewing our contracts, or if our ability to win such projects or agreements requires that we accept lower margins.\nMany of the industries we serve are subject to customer consolidation, rapid technological and regulatory changes, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers\u2019 changing needs could result in decreased demand for our services.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the heavy civil and power generation industries, which are subject to consolidation, rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Consolidation of any of our customers, or groups of our customers, could result in the loss of one or more of these customers, or could affect customer demand for the services we provide. Additionally, changes in technology may reduce demand for the services we provide.\nNew technologies or upgrades to existing technologies by customers could reduce demand for our services. Technological advances may result in lower costs for sources of energy, which could render existing renewable energy projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries we serve could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, certain of our customers face stringent regulatory and environmental requirements and permitting processes as they implement plans for their projects, any of which could result in delays, reductions and cancellations of projects, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Common Stock\nThere may be future sales of our common stock or other dilution of our equity that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In connection with certain completed acquisitions, we have issued shares of our common stock, and\nwe additionally have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash as consideration for future earn-out obligations.\nWe may agree to issue additional shares in connection with other future acquisition or financing transactions, which, if issued, would dilute your share ownership and could lead to volatility in our common stock price. We grow our business organically as well as through acquisition. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of equity securities. In connection with certain acquisitions, we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of paying cash for the related earn-out obligations. Such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions, convertible securities or other issuances of our common stock, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and/or options, or otherwise, will dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ has been volatile in recent years. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our customers' industries;\n\u2022\ncapital spending plans of our significant customers;\n\u2022\nglobal and domestic energy prices;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or one of our competitors of new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years, which have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause shareholders to lose some or all of their investment in our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. Among other things, we will not be required to (1) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new rules that may be adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (3) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (4) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act, (5) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies, or (6) hold a nonbinding\nadvisory vote on executive compensation and obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nAccordingly, the information that we provide shareholders in this annual report and in our other filings with the SEC may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. In particular, as we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and adversely affected. In addition, as we are not required to have our auditors formally attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot predict the outcome of testing in future periods. If, once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm cannot provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (2) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act or any successor statute, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period, and (4) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, or July 6, 2021.\nM III and Oaktree have significant ability to influence corporate decisions.\nOaktree and M III beneficially own approximately 48.0% and 9.5%, respectively, of our common stock as of December 31, 2018. These ownership percentages take into account both the vested founder shares and unvested founder shares.\nAs long as M III or Oaktree own or control a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to significantly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our Board, any amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, each of Oaktree, on the one hand, and M III, on the other hand, will have consent rights over certain matters for so long as Oaktree or M III, respectively, directly or indirectly, beneficially own at least fifty percent (50%) of the Common Stock (including unvested founder shares, in the case of the M III) beneficially owned by the Selling Stockholders or the Sponsors, respectively, as of the closing of our business combination, including:\n\u2022\nentering into, waiving, amending or otherwise modifying the terms of any transaction or agreement between the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (a) the M III or their affiliates or any affiliate of the Company, on the other hand (in the case of Oaktree), other than the exercise of any rights under certain existing agreements (without giving effect to any subsequent amendments) or (b) certain Selling Stockholders, Oaktree or their affiliates (in the case of the M III), subject to certain exceptions, and other than the exercise of any rights under certain existing agreements (without giving effect to any subsequent amendments);\n\u2022\nhiring or removing the Chief Executive Officer or any other executive officer of the Company or its subsidiaries; or\n\u2022\nexcept as contemplated by the Investor Rights Agreement, increasing or decreasing the size of the Board.\nM III and Oaktree will also have ongoing rights to nominate one or two directors, depending on the ownership interests of Oaktree or the M III, respectively, and, in the case of an increase in the size of the Board or an increase in their respective ownership percentages, additional directors proportional to their respective ownership percentages.\nIn addition, Oaktree\u2019s consent will be required under the terms of the Certificate of Designation for the Company and its subsidiaries to take certain actions, including:\n\u2022\nCreating, authorizing or issuing any stock that ranks senior to or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock with\nrespect to payment of dividends or upon liquidation, any capital stock that votes as a single class with the holders of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the consent rights granted pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, or any stock of any subsidiary of the Company (with certain exceptions);\n\u2022\nReclassifying or amending any capital stock if it would render such capital stock senior to or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nEntering into any agreement with respect to or consummating any merger, consolidation or similar event pursuant to which the Company or its subsidiary would not be the surviving entity if as a result of which any capital stock of such surviving entity would rank senior to or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nIncurring or guaranteeing debt if as a result the Company and its subsidiaries would have aggregate debt in excess of $5,000,000 other than pursuant to the replacement credit facility or any refinancing thereof;\n\u2022\nAuthorizing or consummating any change of control event or liquidation (as described in the Certificate of Designation); or\n\u2022\nModifying the Certificate of Designation or other organizational document of the Company in a manner that would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe interests of M III or Oaktree may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. M III and Oaktree are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. M III or Oaktree may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our current certificate and our proposed certificate of incorporation also provides that M III and Oaktree and their respective partners, principals, directors, officers, members, managers and/or employees, including any of the foregoing who serve as officers or directors of the post-combination company, do not have any fiduciary duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as the post-combination company or any of its subsidiaries.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u25aa\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u25aa\nprofitability of our products and services, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u25aa\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u25aa\nimpairment of long-lived assets;\n\u25aa\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u25aa\nnegative publicity relating to products and services we offer;\n\u25aa\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u25aa\nexpansion to new markets; and\n\u25aa\nfluctuations in commodity prices.\nOur articles of incorporation and certain provision of Delaware law contain anti-takeover provisions that could impair a takeover attempt.\nAs a Delaware corporation, anti-takeover provisions may impose an impediment to the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be of benefit to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our\nArticles of Incorporation and Bylaws also may impose an impediment or discourage others from a takeover.\nThese provisions include:\n\u2022\na staggered Board providing for three classes of directors, which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our Board;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by (i) the chairman of our Board, (ii) our Chief Executive Officer, (iii) a majority of our Board, or (iv) directors designated by the Sponsors or Oaktree subject to certain conditions set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that changes or amendments to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws must be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of the Common Stock of the post-combination company and, in the case of our Bylaws, in some cases 80% of the Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 16261, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "IEA"}
