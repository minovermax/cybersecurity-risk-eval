RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation, volatile commodity prices and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials, labor, energy and logistics;\n\u2022political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters or social or labor unrest;\n\u2022changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n\u2022exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product, including as a result of COVID-19, or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n\u2022lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n\u2022foreign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n\u2022changes to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics, profit controls or other government controls.\nAny or all of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\nIn addition, there continue to be uncertainties related to the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly referred to as Brexit), including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU (the \u201cEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d). These uncertainties include the impact of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on businesses in the EU and the United Kingdom and how the new relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom will develop over time, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and/or the euro and disruptions to our workforce and that of\nour suppliers and business partners. We do not, however, believe Brexit has had or will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFurthermore, the imposition of tariffs and/or increase in tariffs on various products by the United States and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries and new and/or increased tariffs have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us to additional costs and expenditure of resources. Major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the United States and/or other countries, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\nWe face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models.\nWe face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do, introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more effectively to business and economic conditions and changing consumer preferences, including by launching innovative new products. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience elevated demand for some of our products as compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights, against infringement and legal challenges by competitors.\nWe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIncreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, the rapid growth of eCommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do. They have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances, slotting fees or increased investment, including through display media, paid search, preparation fees and co-op programs, which have led to and could continue to lead to reduced sales or profitability in certain markets. The loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our customers, see \u201cDistribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents\u201d in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nWe also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, or environmental, sustainability, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives. For example, a determination\nby a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental, supply chain or packaging standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, \u201cprivate label\u201d products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products.\nFurther, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer (DTC) businesses. These trends accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. If we are not successful in continuing to adapt or to effectively react to changes in consumer preferences, purchasing patterns and market dynamics and/or expanding sales through eCommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels, including the profitable expansion of our own DTC capabilities, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\u2022identify, develop and fund technological innovations;\n\u2022obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and\n\u2022anticipate and quickly respond to the needs and preferences of consumers and customers.\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products that drive incremental sales involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace.\nOur ability to quickly innovate to adapt and market our products and to adapt our packaging to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. The failure to develop and launch successful new products or to adapt our packaging and supply chain to meet such preferences could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.\nWe face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics or similar widespread public health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic, epidemic or similar widespread health concern could have, and COVID-19 has had and will continue to have, a variety of impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u2022our ability to continue to maintain and support the health, safety and well-being of our employees, including key employees;\n\u2022disruptions to our global supply chain, including the closure of manufacturing and distribution facilities, due to, among other things, the lack of availability of raw and packaging materials or manufacturing components; a decrease in our workforce or in the efficiency of such workforce, including as a result of illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism or governmental regulations; transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions or volume and capacity restraints; or the impact of COVID-19 on our retailers, third party suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or distributors;\n\u2022volatility in the demand for and availability of our products, which may be caused by the temporary inability of our consumers to purchase our products due to illness, financial hardship, quarantine, government actions mandating the closure of our facilities (which impacted some of our production facilities in Asia in 2021), distributors or retailers and/or imposing travel or movement restrictions, shifts in demand and consumption away from more discretionary or higher priced products to lower-priced products or pantry-loading activity;\n\u2022changes in purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of in-store visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and a shift to purchasing our products online and disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail;\n\u2022significant volatility in demand for certain of our products, which may require us to increase our production capacity or acquire additional capacity at an additional cost and expense;\n\u2022failure of third parties on which we rely, including our retailers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, customers, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties;\n\u2022significant changes in the economic and political conditions of the markets in which we operate, which could restrict and have restricted our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, could mandate and have mandated or caused the closure of certain distributors or retailers, our offices, shared business service centers and/or operating and manufacturing facilities or otherwise could prevent and have prevented us as well as our third-party partners, suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the manufacture, distribution, sale and support of our products;\n\u2022disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets, which may increase the cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital; and/or\n\u2022volatility in foreign exchange rates and increases in the cost of raw and packaging materials and transportation and logistics costs.\nDespite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration, severity and geographic scope of an outbreak, such as COVID-19, including the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the availability, distribution, acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain its spread and mitigate its public health and economic effects, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Furthermore, these and other impacts of COVID-19 could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d For additional information regarding how COVID-19 has affected or is expected to affect our business, refer to\nPart II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.\u201d\nDamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nMaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, DE&I, sustainability and social impact, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives. Negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients, our packaging, our environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices, including as they relate to sustainability, DE&I, or our employees, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. Such negative publicity could relate to, among other things, health concerns, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, environmental impact (including deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management), our ESG practices or our sustainability targets. In addition, the proliferation of digital and social media has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination and the potential for negative publicity. Negative publicity, posts or comments on digital and social media about us, our brands, our products, our sustainability efforts, our environmental and social impact (including our packaging) or our employees, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. The success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers.\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, compliance and ESG practices, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.\nIn addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit, attract and retain key employees, including through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. Further, changes in immigration laws and government policies, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have made, in certain circumstances, and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. Our ability to attract and retain talent has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the United States, which is experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, a shift toward remote work and the effects of COVID-19. In addition, we also continue to work to advance culture change through the implementation of DE&I initiatives throughout our organization. We are also implementing new ways of working to, among other things, instill a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization. If we do not (or are perceived not to) successfully implement these initiatives, our ability to recruit, attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses, assets or technologies from third parties. Acquisitions and their pursuit have involved, and can involve, numerous potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022realizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all;\n\u2022successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of the acquired brands, assets or businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u2022receiving necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction;\n\u2022diverting management\u2019s attention from other business priorities;\n\u2022successfully operating in new lines of business, channels of distribution or markets;\n\u2022achieving distribution expansion related to products, categories and markets;\n\u2022retaining key employees, partners, suppliers and customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own;\n\u2022developing or launching products with acquired technologies; and\n\u2022other unanticipated problems or liabilities.\nMoreover, acquisitions have resulted in and could in the future result in substantial additional debt, the assumption of contingent liabilities, such as litigation or earn-out obligations, or transaction costs. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with an acquisition or investment diminish in the future or the performance of an acquired company or business is less robust than expected, we may be required to record additional impairments of intangible assets, including trademarks and goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we took a non-cash, aftertax impairment charge of $518 million to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and a trade name intangible asset related to the Filorga skin health business. Any of these risks could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have divested and may in the future periodically divest brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. In addition, businesses under consideration for, or otherwise subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nOur business results are impacted by our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities.\nWe are engaged in the manufacture and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. Our operations and those of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or logistics providers have been and may continue to be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022environmental events;\n\u2022widespread health emergencies, such as COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics;\n\u2022strikes and other labor disputes;\n\u2022disruptions in logistics;\n\u2022loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites;\n\u2022loss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers;\n\u2022supplier capacity constraints;\n\u2022raw material and product quality or safety issues;\n\u2022industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;\n\u2022the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets;\n\u2022the lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers and production labor;\n\u2022governmental incentives and controls (including import and export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); and\n\u2022natural disasters, including climatic events (including any potential effects of climate change) and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or explosions, cyber-security incidents and other external factors over which we have no control.\nIn addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. If our existing or new suppliers fail to meet such standards or if we are unable to contract with suppliers on favorable terms, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the supplies of raw and packaging materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate. In addition, we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers and the supply of raw and packaging materials. Nonetheless, a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, have at times interrupted and could, in the future, interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, human resources, global information technology and data analytics are concentrated in key office facilities. A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nVolatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability.\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs of and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy and logistics (including trucks and containers) and other necessary services, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our profit margins. Inflationary pressures have also increased and may continue to increase the cost of such commodities and services. If commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases, achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases. Also, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may\ndecide not to pay higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See \u201cOur business results depend on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities\u201d above for additional information.\nThere is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.\u201d\nWe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the \u201c2022 Global Productivity Initiative\u201d). The program is intended to reallocate resources toward our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. The successful implementation of the program may present organizational challenges and, in some cases, may require successful negotiations with third parties. As a result, we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax, labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the anticipated cost savings as measured in U.S. dollars. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges.\u201d\nA cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems (\u201cIT Systems\u201d), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers;\n\u2022ordering and managing materials from suppliers;\n\u2022converting materials to finished products;\n\u2022receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers and consumers;\n\u2022marketing products to consumers;\n\u2022collecting, storing, transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, including, but not limited to, such data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, and\nresidents of the State of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020;\n\u2022processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors;\n\u2022hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information;\n\u2022summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting;\n\u2022managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;\n\u2022complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements;\n\u2022providing data security; and\n\u2022handling other processes involved in managing our business.\nAlthough we have a broad array of information security measures in place, our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, IT Systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our third-party service providers is securely maintained, data leakages due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. Furthermore, we periodically upgrade our IT Systems or adopt new technologies. If such an upgrade or new technology does not function as designed, does not go as planned or increases our exposure to a cyber-attack or cyber incident, it may adversely impact our business, including our ability to ship products to customers, issue invoices and process payments or order raw and packaging materials. Although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cyber-security incidents we have experienced to date, if we suffer a significant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, or otherwise, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber-security incidents and IT System failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our business, reputation or brands that may result from an incident.\nFurthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT Systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nClimate change and other sustainability matters could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and its impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Specifically,\nthe predicted effects of climate change may exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water and other ingredients. In addition, the increased concern over climate change is likely to result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements intended to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment and may relate to, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., carbon pricing), alternative energy policy and additional disclosure obligations. Such additional regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition by increasing our compliance and manufacturing costs and/or negatively impacting our reputation if we are unable to, or are perceived (whether or not valid) not to, satisfy such requirements. Despite our sustainability efforts, any failure to achieve our sustainability targets, including those aimed to reduce our impact on, improve or preserve the environment, or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients and ingredient transparency. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad.\nOur business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities around the world review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. While we monitor and seek to mitigate the impact of any emerging information, a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products or ingredients on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. We are also subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. (including, without limitation, those imposed by OFAC) and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted. While our policies mandate compliance with these laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, findings that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations have subjected us to, and could subject us to, civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is\nunsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-of-pocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLegal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we are and may continue to be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective, or unsafe or have a quality issue, we have had to and may in the future need to withdraw, recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a withdrawal, recall or reformulation is required or advisable, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19, may adversely affect our business.\nUncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, inflation and/or reduced category growth rates, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our business and result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty or unfavorable economic conditions, consumers may reduce consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to \u201cprivate label\u201d or lower-priced brands. These changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins. Furthermore, economic conditions can cause our suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other third-party partners to suffer financial or operational difficulties, which may impact their inability to provide us with or distribute finished product, raw and packaging materials and/or services in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we could face difficulty collecting or recovering accounts receivables from third parties facing financial or operational difficulties.\nDisruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets, interest rate increases, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that are expected to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain\ninterest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. In addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. Changes in the mix of our earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in tax rates, changes in tax laws, including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, long-standing international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of a multilateral project, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (the \u201cBEPS Project\u201d), that has established new principles and reporting requirements recommended by countries that then made up the G8 and the G20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d). In connection with the BEPS Project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the U.S. The OECD, through the BEPS Project, is also addressing the challenges of the digitization of the global economy with plans to redefine jurisdictional taxation rights in market countries and establish a global minimum tax. As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially impacted. For more information regarding U.S. tax reform, see Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, when a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we have faced and in the future may face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, in excess of reserves. The payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18729, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "CL"}
