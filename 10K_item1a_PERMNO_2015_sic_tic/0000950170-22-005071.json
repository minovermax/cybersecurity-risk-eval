RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors apply to our business and operations and the industry in which we operate. These risk factors are not exhaustive, and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our business, financial condition, and prospects. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, including matters addressed in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business, financial condition, or prospects. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the risk factors that apply to our business and operations and the industry in which we operate. The list below is not exhaustive, and investors should read this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in full. Some of the risks we face include:\nRisks related to our business and industry\n\u2022Our transition from the diesel pressure pumping market has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to generate revenues and service our outstanding indebtedness for a period of time.\n\u2022Our reduction in fleet size and expansion into new geographical areas has reduced our economies of scale and has impacted and may continue to impact our profitability.\n\u2022Our dependence on the level of capital spending and exploration and production activity by the onshore oil and natural gas industry in the United States, which is beyond our control.\n\u2022The volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our services and negatively impact our results of operations.\n\u2022Our level of current and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\u2022Our debt financing agreements subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants, which may limit our operational or financial flexibility and subject us to potential defaults under our credit facilities.\n\u2022Our current and future debt financing agreements contain certain provisions, such as PIK interest, call protection and exit fees that may grow over time and reduce value for shareholders.\n\u2022The phase-out of LIBOR may adversely affect a portion of our outstanding debt.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to unforeseen interruptions and hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, for which we may not be adequately insured.\n\u2022Our long-term contracts are subject to certain risks, including counterparty payment risks, inability to renew or replace at favorable economic terms, and changing market conditions that result in higher costs without offsetting revenue escalations.\n\u2022We are dependent on a few customers in a single industry. The loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, prospects, and results of operations.\n\u2022Rising and volatile material costs and supply chain constraints or disruptions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022We rely on a limited number of suppliers for major equipment to build new and upgrade existing electric fleets to our custom Clean Fleet\u00ae design, which exposes us to risks including price and timing of delivery. Our failure to meet current commitments to these vendors could result in our inability to build fleets in the future and may impact our ability to repair and replace certain equipment.\n\u2022We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide generators to power our custom Clean Fleet\u00ae design, which exposes us to risks relating to operating performance and availability of supply. An inability to secure power generation assets could materially impact our operations.\n\u2022We rely on a limited number of third parties for proppant and chemicals and delays in deliveries and increases in the cost of such materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Our assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\n\u2022An inability to access capital on favorable terms to fund our capital commitments may have an adverse impact on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may require us to raise capital on unfavorable terms that could result in dilution to our shareholders.\n\u2022We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, under which we may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures.\n\u2022Climate change legislation, regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases or other action taken by public or private entities related to climate change could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas produced by our customers.\n\u2022We may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share if we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights, or we may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\u2022Changes in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\n\u2022Restrictions on the ability to obtain water for exploration and production activities and the disposal of flowback and produced water may impact the operations of oil and gas companies and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Our ability to expand our operations relies in part on our ability to market our Clean Fleet\u00ae technology, and advancements in well service technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022We may record losses or impairment charges related to idled assets or assets we sell.\n\u2022Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) to offset future income may be limited.\n\u2022Our evaluation of capital markets and strategic alternatives may not be successful in identifying or completing any capital market or strategic alternative transactions, and any such capital market or strategic alternative transactions may not result in additional value for our shareholders or the process may have an adverse impact on our business and shareholders.\nRisks related to our securities\n\u2022Our only significant asset is the ownership of USWS Holdings, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\n\u2022The trading price of our stock price may continue to be volatile.\n\u2022If our Class A common stock is delisted, the market price and liquidity of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise additional capital would be adversely impacted.\n\u2022The requirements of being a public company increases costs and distracts management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\n\u2022We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will result in significant savings.\n\u2022An active, liquid, and orderly trading market for our securities may not be maintained, which could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\n\u2022Future sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\n\u2022Certain of our principal stockholders have significant influence over us.\n\u2022In certain circumstances, we may amend the terms of our Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders without approval by all of the warrant holders.\n\u2022We may redeem unexpired Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their Public Warrants worthless.\n\u2022The exercise of our outstanding warrants or conversions of our outstanding preferred stock or Convertible Senior Notes could increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\n\u2022Our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of the Class A common stock.\n\u2022Our charter contains forum selection provisions that may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nRisks related to general and other factors\n\u2022We are subject to risks related to pandemics or epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\u2022Competition may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\n\u2022We may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.\n\u2022We are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\u2022We are exposed to risks related to our ability to employ and retain key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers.\n\u2022Anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\n\u2022A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022Delays or restrictions in obtaining permits by us for our operations or by our customers for their operations could impair our business.\n\u2022We may be negatively impacted by inflation.\n\u2022Rising interest rates may adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur transition from the diesel pressure pumping market has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to generate revenues and service our outstanding indebtedness for a period of time.\nSince our announcement in May 2021 of our commitment to becoming an all-electric pressure pumping services provider, we have sold most of our legacy, diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of fleets we have available to provide pressure pumping services. Until we can complete the build out of additional all-electric pressure pumping equipment, we expect to generate less revenue, which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, the decrease in revenue has resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in the borrowing base available under our ABL Credit Facility, which may adversely impact our liquidity. Furthermore, we have also expanded our operations into new geographical areas as our fleet availability has been reduced, which has resulted in a reduction in our economies of scale which has and may continue to have an adverse impact on the profitability of our operations.\nOur business depends on the level of capital spending and exploration and production activity by the onshore oil and natural gas industry in the United States, and the level of such activity is affected by industry conditions that are beyond our control.\nOur business is directly affected by the willingness of our customers to make expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas from onshore resources in the United States. The willingness of our customers to undertake these activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022prices, and expectations about future prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and related products;\n\u2022the level of global and domestic oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services and equipment in the United States;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as exploration and production activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u2022the availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022geopolitical developments and political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as an epidemic or pandemic disease outbreak;\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022epidemics, pandemics, or other major public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is volatile. A prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the United States, adverse events relating to the energy industry or regional, national, and global economic conditions and factors could negatively impact exploration and production activity and the level of drilling and completion activity by some of our customers. This volatility may result in a decline in the demand for, or adversely affect the price of, our services. In addition, material declines in oil and natural gas prices, the development of oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas or drilling or completion activity in the U.S. oil and natural gas shale regions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our services and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe demand for our services is substantially influenced by current and anticipated crude oil and natural gas commodity prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices (or the perception that crude oil and natural gas commodity prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers, and the products and services we provide are, to a substantial extent, deferrable in the event oil and natural gas companies reduce capital expenditures. As a result, we may experience lower utilization of, and may be forced to lower our rates for, our equipment and services.\nHistorical prices for crude oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. The market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control, including worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas and actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations. Prolonged periods of price instability in the oil and natural gas industry will adversely affect the demand for our products and services, our financial condition, prospects and results of operations and our ability to service our debt or fund capital expenditures.\nFor example, the price of oil fell significantly in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the worldwide economy and global demand for oil. As a result, E&P companies moved to significantly cut costs, both by decreasing drilling and completion activity and by demanding price concessions from their service providers, including providers of pressure pumping services. In turn, service providers, including pressure pumping service providers, were forced to lower their operating costs and capital expenditures, while continuing to operate their businesses in an extremely competitive environment.\nOil and natural gas prices continued to fluctuate in fiscal year 2021, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic contributing to volatility and uncertainty. Towards the end of the year, prices increased significantly and with the increase in commodity prices demand for our services improved. However, persistent commodity price volatility, supply chain disruptions and deteriorating economic conditions could impact our near-term business prospects and ability to forecast future performance. We expect our customers to react to commodity price volatility by adjusting their level of capital spending accordingly.\nAdditionally, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce the demand for oil and natural gas products, creating downward pressure on commodity prices and the prices we are able to charge for our services.\nOur level of current and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of March 15, 2022, we had $6.4 million of borrowings outstanding, with available capacity of $9.5 million, under our ABL Credit Facility. Our ABL Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on April 1, 2025. As of March 15, 2022, we had $116.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our Term A Loan and Term B Loan (collectively the \"Senior Secured Term Loan\") and an additional $21.5 million outstanding under our Term C Loan pursuant to our Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement. Our Senior Secured Term Loan and Term C Loan are scheduled to mature on December 5, 2025. On our Senior Secured Term Loan, we are required to make quarterly principal payments of $1.25 million until March 31, 2023 and $5.0 million from June 30, 2023 through September 30, 2025, with final payment due at maturity. Our Term C Loan has a PIK interest rate of 14.0% and contains provisions with up to a 100% premium payable upon any repayment, prepayment or acceleration. Our obligations under our ABL Credit Facility, Senior Secured Term Loan and Term C Loan are secured by substantially all our assets.\nAs of March 15, 2022, we had $25.0 million outstanding under our USDA Loan. Our USDA Loan is scheduled to mature on November 12, 2030, subject to equal monthly principal payments beginning on December 12, 2023. Our USDA Loan is secured by certain of our pressure pumping equipment.\nAs of March 15, 2022, the aggregate outstanding balance under our equipment financing notes was $7.7 million, of which $3.1 million is due within one year. Our equipment financing notes are secured by certain of our pressure pumping equipment.\nCertain of our debt instruments include provisions, such as PIK interest, repayment and other premiums, and fees which will result in the amount of outstanding debt to increase significantly over time. Upon maturity of our indebtedness, we will be required to repay, extend or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to extend, replace or refinance any one or all of our existing debt financing agreements on terms reasonably acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, our lenders under our ABL Credit Facility, Senior Secured Term Loan, Term C Loan, USDA Loan, or equipment financing notes can seek to foreclose on our assets. For more information about our debt financing agreements and equipment financing notes, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Debt and Note 20 - Subsequent Events.\u201d\nAs of March 15, 2022, we had $126.9 million of principal, including PIK interest, outstanding of the Convertible Senior Notes, which are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock at the option of the holders. The Convertible Senior Notes, subject to earlier conversion, are due and payable on June 5, 2026 in shares of Class A common stock equal to the entire outstanding and unpaid principal balance, plus any PIK interest, subject to certain limitations on the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be issued and which would require the Company to settle the conversion in payment partially in cash.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon future performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay our debt service obligations when due. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness, which would increase the amount of cash flow we need to service debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to restructure or refinance all or a portion of such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you, however, that we would be able to sell assets, restructure, or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit profile, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. To the extent inadequate liquidity or other considerations require us to seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, our ability to do so will depend on numerous factors, including many beyond our control, such as the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any new or refinancing or restructuring of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates or other unfavorable terms and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Furthermore, our current and future indebtedness may discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur debt financing agreements subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants. These restrictions may limit our operational or financial flexibility and could subject us to potential defaults under our credit facilities.\nOur debt financing agreements subject us to restrictive covenants, including, among other things, limitations (each of which is subject to certain exceptions) on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets) and asset sales or other types of dispositions, restrict subsidiary dividends or other subsidiary distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates and swap counterparties, make investments and restricted payments, permit subsidiaries to provide guarantees to other material debt, and enter into leases and sale and lease back arrangements.\nAdditionally, our ABL Credit Facility is subject to a springing fixed charge coverage covenant. For a description of the covenants under our ABL Credit Facility, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 - Debt.\u201d If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants of our ABL Credit Facility, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, subject to the limits contained in our debt financing agreements, we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time. Any borrowings we may incur in the future would have several important consequences for our future operations, including that:\n\u2022covenants contained in the documents governing such indebtedness may require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry, such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022we may be competitively disadvantaged to our competitors that are less leveraged or have greater access to capital resources; and\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, may adversely affect a portion of our outstanding debt.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, has ceased to publish USD LIBOR for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors. Further, on March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration announced its intention to cease the publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phase-out could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative floating borrowing rate, may adversely affect our borrowing costs. While our ABL Credit Facility and Senior Secured Term Loan are scheduled to mature in April 2025 and December 2025, respectively, potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes in interest rate benchmarks may adversely affect our ability to refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative floating borrowing rates on the portion of our outstanding debt that is LIBOR based. Challenges in changing to a different borrowing interest rate may result in less favorable pricing on certain of our debt instruments and could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to unforeseen interruptions and hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are exposed to the risks inherent to our industry, such as equipment defects, vehicle accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations and various environmental hazards, such as oil spills and releases of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. For example, our operations are subject to risks associated with pressure pumping, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. In addition, our operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including blizzards, tornadoes, storms, floods, other adverse weather conditions and earthquakes. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to our business due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage or other damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our operations. Litigation arising from operations where our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. The cost of managing such risks may be significant, and the frequency and severity of such incidents may affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees, and regulators. Our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our environmental or safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues.\nOur insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may suffer, and the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise. We are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or coverage is excluded from our policy, or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. Insurance rates in the past have been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions or the imposition of sub-limits for certain risks. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur long-term contracts are subject to certain risks, including counterparty payment risks, inability to renew or replace at favorable economic terms, and changing market conditions that result in higher costs without offsetting revenue escalations.\nWe generally have long-term written contractual arrangements with our customers on most of our equipment. The counterparties to our contractual arrangements are subject to various market risks that impact their businesses and, as a result, they may be unable to make payments to us pursuant to the payment terms set forth in such contractual arrangements. Additionally, as contracts with our customers come up for replacement or renewal, changing market conditions may prevent us from replacing or renewing the contracts on comparable terms. Our ability to achieve favorable terms under these expiring contracts could be affected by many factors, including prolonged reduced commodity prices, decrease in demand for our services or increased competition in the markets we serve. If we are unable to replace or renew the expiring agreements on comparable terms, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nWith no long-term contract in place, such customers could cease buying our services at any time, for any reason, with little or no recourse. If multiple customers or a material customer with whom we did not have a long-term contract in place elected not to purchase our services, our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a few customers in a single industry. The loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, prospects, and results of operations.\nOur customers are engaged in the oil and natural gas E&P business in the United States. Historically, we have been dependent upon a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three customers each accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenues and collectively represented 50.4% of our consolidated revenues. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. Additionally, the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by frequent consolidation activity and, recently, by frequent financial distress and bankruptcy filings. Changes in ownership of our customers or bankruptcy filings by our customers may result in the loss of, or reduction in, business from those customers. If we were to lose any material customer, or if a major customer fails to pay or delays in paying for our services, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nRising and volatile material costs and supply chain constraints or disruptions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe use certain products supplied by customers in our operations, including water and sand. As a result of supply chain constraints, our customers experienced shortages of water and sand, which led to significant downtime during the fourth quarter of 2021. This downtime, and any continued downtime resulting from continued supply chain constraints and related supply shortages, have had and may continue to have a negative impact our ability to generate revenue. In addition, continued supply chain constraints may result in rising costs that we pay for supplies, which would decrease our ability to perform our services at a profitable level.\nIt is also possible that supply chain constraints or disruptions will result in significant delivery delays with respect to the equipment that we need to build our new Nyx Clean Fleets\u00ae. If we are unable to build out our new Nyx Clean Fleets\u00ae as a result of any delivery delays, we may not be in position to enter into contracts with customers, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for major equipment to build new and upgrade existing electric fleets to our current custom Clean Fleet\u00ae design, and our reliance on these vendors exposes us to risks including price and timing of delivery. Our failure to meet current commitments to these vendors could result in our inability to build fleets in the future and may impact our ability to repair and replace certain equipment.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for major equipment to build our new fleets and upgrade any existing electric fleets as needed to our current custom Clean Fleet\u00ae design. During periods in which pressure pumping services are in high demand, we have experienced delays in obtaining certain parts that are used in fabricating and assembling our fleets. If demand for fleets or the components necessary to build such fleets increases or these vendors face financial distress or bankruptcy, these vendors may not be able to provide the new or upgraded fleets on schedule or at the current price. If this were to occur, we could be required to seek other suppliers for major equipment to build or upgrade our fleets, which may adversely affect our revenues or increase our costs. We have made certain commitments to purchase new fleets from these vendors. Our failure to meet these commitments could impact our ability to build new fleets in the future and impair our ability to repair or replace certain equipment on existing fleets.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide generators to power our custom Clean Fleet\u00ae design, which exposes us to risks relating to operating performance and availability of supply. An inability to secure power generation assets could materially impact our operations.\nOur current custom Clean Fleet\u00ae requires the use of power generators in order to operate. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide us with the power generators required to operate our Clean Fleet\u00ae and, as a result, we are exposed to certain supply chain and operational risks with respect to such power generators. As the availability of power generators remains limited as a result of current supply chain disruptions, we may not be able to obtain new or replacement power generators as needed to operate our fleets, which would impact our ability to provide pressure pumping services to our customers and would have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties for proppant and chemicals and delays in deliveries and increases in the cost of such materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with a limited number of suppliers of our raw materials (such as proppant and chemicals). Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary materials or otherwise fail to deliver the materials in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increasing and volatile costs of such materials may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our business operations. In the past, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with pressure pumping operations requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of materials, including proppant.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur fleets and other completion service-related equipment require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. The costs of components and labor may increase in the future which will require us to incur additional costs to maintain, upgrade and/or refurbish our fleets. Our fleets and other equipment typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, upgrades, or refurbishment. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Furthermore, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our fleets and the increase in cost of labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may increase our costs.\nAn inability to access capital on favorable terms to fund our capital commitments may have an adverse impact on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may require us to raise capital on unfavorable terms that could result in dilution to our shareholders.\nWe have entered into certain agreements for the build out of our new next-generation all-electric fleets, some of which will require significant capital commitments. If we are not able to fund such capital commitments from our generated cash flows, we may be required to access the capital or credit markets. Our current or future capital structure, operating performance or financial condition may not permit us to access the capital or credit markets or to obtain other financing at the times, in the amounts and on the terms necessary or advisable for us to successfully carry out our business strategy or to fund our capital commitments, which would have an adverse impact on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and could result in dilution to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety, and protection of the environment, including with respect to our pressure pumping operations. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Any changes in laws or government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, clean air and drinking water, endangered species, GHGs, nonattainment areas, the environment, health and safety, chemical use and storage, waste management, waste disposal, corrective action and transportation of waste and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials. Our operations involve risks of environmental liability, including leakage from an operator\u2019s casing during our operations or accidental spills onto or into surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability, or both. In some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Additionally, environmental concerns, including clean air, drinking water contamination and seismic activity, have prompted investigations that could lead to the enactment of regulations, limitations, restrictions or moratoria that could potentially result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties (administrative, civil or criminal), revocations of permits to conduct business, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures and/or claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste, nuisance or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations, permits and other requirements may also include the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, revocation of permits and temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, and results of operations. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements, limitations, restrictions or moratoria on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities at a federal, state or local level or changes in the way these requirements are interpreted or enforced could significantly delay or interrupt our operations, limit the amount of work we can perform, increase our costs of compliance, or increase the cost of our services, thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For more information about regulations and laws regarding issues of health, safety, and protection of the environment in our industry, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations.\u201d\nIn December 2016, the EPA issued a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA report states that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking resources under some circumstances and identifies certain conditions in which the EPA believes the impact of such activities on drinking water and groundwater can be more frequent or severe. The EPA study could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, state legislatures, state regulatory agencies and local municipalities may consider legislation, regulations, or ordinances, respectively that could affect all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry and occasionally take action to restrict or further regulate hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, counties and municipalities have enacted or are considering moratoria on hydraulic fracturing or zoning ordinances, which could impose a de facto ban on drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations. Currently, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state and municipal actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. Compliance, stricter regulations, or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. For more information about regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations.\u201d\nFurthermore, many states in which we operate require the disclosure of some or all the chemicals used in our pressure pumping operations. Certain aspects of one or more of these chemicals may be considered proprietary by us or our chemical suppliers. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical information to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of our trade secrets or those of our chemical suppliers and could result in competitive harm to us, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Additionally, our business could be affected by a moratorium or increased regulation of companies in our supply chain, such as sand mining by our proppant suppliers, which could limit our access to supplies and increase the costs of our raw materials. At this time, it is not possible to estimate how these various restrictions could affect our ongoing operations.\nMany regulatory and legislative bodies routinely evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and regulations affecting the oil and gas industry. Reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants is one of the sectors designated for increased enforcement by the EPA, which, in addition to state and local governing bodies, will continue to regulate our industry in the years to come. Laws and regulations protecting the environment, especially those related to GHGs and climate change, generally have become more stringent over time, and we expect them to continue to do so. This could lead to material increases in our costs and liability exposure for future environmental compliance and remediation and may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline because of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. Additionally, if we expand the size or scope of our operations, we could be subject to regulations that are more stringent than the requirements under which we are currently allowed to operate or require additional authorizations to continue operations. Compliance with this additional regulatory burden could increase our operating or other costs.\nAdditionally, failure to comply with government, industry or our own environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or failure to comply with our compliance or reporting requirements, could tarnish our reputation for safety and quality and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, customers maintain their own compliance and reporting requirements, and if we do not perform in accordance with their requirements, we could lose business from our customers, many of whom have an increased focus on environmental and safety issues.\nClimate change legislation, regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases or other action taken by public or private entities related to climate change could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas produced by our customers.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs but no such legislation has yet been adopted by Congress. Some states have individually or in regional cooperation, imposed restrictions on GHG emissions under various policies and approaches, including establishing a cap on emissions, requiring efficiency measures, or providing incentives for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy sources, or use of replacement fuels with lower carbon content. In the future, the United States has also chosen to adhere to international agreements targeting GHGs reductions (e.g., the Paris Agreement). The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas our customers produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For more information about climate change legislation, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations.\u201d\nFurthermore, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation or investigations, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the causation of, or contribution to, the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. The ultimate impact of GHGs emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on our Company\u2019s financial performance is highly uncertain because we are unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.\nIf we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.\nWe have been granted or have received notice of allowance for 62 patents and have an additional 201 patents pending. If we are not able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we have now or acquire in the future, our competitive advantage would be diminished. Additionally, competitors may be able to replicate our technology or services protected by our intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that any patents we have been granted or may obtain in the future would provide us with any significant commercial benefit or would allow us to prevent our competitors from employing comparable technologies or processes.\nWe may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThird parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates intellectual property rights, or we may initiate legal proceedings in order to enforce our intellectual property rights. If we initiate such proceedings or if any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us, we may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation, diverting the attention of management and our employees. We may not prevail in any such legal proceedings related to such claims, and our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute, or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. If we are unsuccessful in defending such claims, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly regardless of the merits of any claim and is inherently unpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, regardless of its outcome.\nIf we were to discover that our technologies or products infringe valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. If our inability to obtain required licenses for our technologies or products prevents us from selling our products, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various transportation regulations, including as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various federal and state agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size. As the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and GHG emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and an increase in operating expenses. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain routes or times on specific roadways. Proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nOil and natural gas companies are substantially dependent on the availability of water during pressure pumping operations. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water for exploration and production activities and the disposal of flowback and produced water may impact their operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWater is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during pressure pumping operations. Our oil and natural gas producing customers\u2019 access to water to be used in this process may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third-party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. The occurrence of these or similar developments may result in limitations being placed on allocations of water due to needs by third-party businesses with more senior contractual or permitting rights to the water. Our customers\u2019 inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact their E&P operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, the imposition of new environmental regulations and other regulatory initiatives could include increased restrictions on our producing customers\u2019 ability to dispose of flowback and produced water generated in hydraulic fracturing or other fluids resulting from E&P activities. For more information about water-related regulations, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations.\u201d Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells and any inability to secure transportation and access to disposal wells with sufficient capacity to accept all of our flowback and produced water on economic terms may increase our customers\u2019 operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our customers\u2019 operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, the legal requirements related to the disposal of produced water into a non-producing geologic formation by means of underground injection wells are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern arises from seismic events near underground disposal wells that are used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. States may issue orders to temporarily shut down or to curtail the injection depth of existing wells in the vicinity of seismic events.\nAnother consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation to limit or prohibit oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal.\nAny one or more of these developments may result in us or our vendors having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, or require us or our vendors to shut down or curtail the injection into disposal wells, which events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to expand our operations relies in part on our ability to market our Clean Fleet\u00ae technology, and advancements in well service technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pressure pumping industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent or other intellectual property protections. For example, we use our patented Clean Fleet\u00ae technology as a competitive advantage in the markets we serve. As competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to develop, implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies before we can. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or services at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. New technology could also make it easier for our customers to vertically integrate their operations, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for our services. Limits on our ability to effectively use or implement new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may record losses or impairment charges related to idle assets or assets that we sell.\nProlonged periods of low utilization, changes in technology or the sale of assets below their carrying value may cause us to experience losses. These events could result in the recognition of impairment charges that negatively impact our financial results. Significant impairment charges because of a decline in market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) to offset future income may be limited.\nThe ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years could become subject to significant limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code if we undergo an ownership change. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 occurs if the percentage of stock owned by an entity\u2019s 5% shareholder (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. The annual limitation is generally equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, a rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may generally be carried over to later years until the NOL carryforwards expire.\nDue to historical performance of cumulative losses, the NOL carryforwards are fully reserved with a valuation allowance. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support a full or partial reversal.\nWe are evaluating capital markets and strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any capital market or strategic alternative transactions, that any such capital market or strategic alternative transactions will result in additional value for our shareholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business and shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors continues to evaluate a range of capital markets and strategic alternative transactions. These transactions could include, but are not limited to, equity capital and / or debt capital raises, debt refinancing transactions, asset divestitures, monetization of intellectual property, and mergers, reverse mergers or other business combinations. There can be no assurance that the review of capital markets and strategic alternative transactions will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. Our Board of Directors may also determine that our most effective strategy is to continue to effectuate our current business plan. The process of reviewing capital markets and strategic alternative transactions may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential capital markets and strategic alternative transactions. No decision has been made with respect to any transaction and we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and undertake any transaction that allows our shareholders to realize an increase in the value of their common stock or provide any guidance on the timing of such action, if any.\nWe also cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternatives, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms. We do not intend to comment regarding the evaluation of capital markets and strategic alternative transactions until such time as our Board of Directors has determined the outcome of the process or otherwise has deemed that disclosure is appropriate or required by applicable law. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur only significant asset is the ownership interest in USWS Holdings, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nWe have no direct operations or significant assets other than the ownership in USWS Holdings. We depend on USWS Holdings and its subsidiaries, including USWS LLC, for distributions, loans, and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. However, legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing indebtedness of USWS Holdings and its subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of USWS Holdings and its subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from USWS Holdings. The earnings from, or other available assets of, USWS Holdings and its subsidiaries, may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations. To the extent that we require funds and USWS Holdings or its subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to pay our income taxes when due.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the past twelve months, the sales price of our stock ranged from a low of $0.79 per share in February 2022, to a high of $11.80 per share in February 2021.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for energy related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nAs a result of this volatility, our securities could experience rapid and substantial decreases in price, and you may be able to sell shares of our Class A common stock only at a substantial loss to the price at which you purchased the securities.\nSome, but not all, of the factors that may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or the quarterly or annual financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us or relevant for our business;\n\u2022changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022failure of our services to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar or relevant companies;\n\u2022success of competitive service offerings or technologies;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as the issuance of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022announcements by us or by our competitors of significant services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the United States;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perceptions;\n\u2022actual or purported \u201cshort squeeze\u201d trading activity;\n\u2022changes in general economic, industry or market conditions; and\n\u2022volatility driven by social media or website posts which may have no relation to our results of operations.\nIn addition, if the market for energy related stocks, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nFurther, on some occasions, our stock price may be, or may be purported to be, subject to \u201cshort squeeze\u201d activity. A \u201cshort squeeze\u201d is a technical market condition that occurs when the price of a stock increases substantially, forcing market participants who had taken a position that its price would fall (i.e., who had sold the stock \u201cshort\u201d), to buy it, which in turn may create significant, short-term demand for the stock not for fundamental reasons, but rather due to the need for such market participants to acquire the stock in order to forestall the risk of even greater losses. A \u201cshort squeeze\u201d condition in the market for a stock can lead to short-term conditions involving very high volatility and trading that may or may not track fundamental valuation models.\nIf our Class A common stock is delisted, the market price and liquidity of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise additional capital would be adversely impacted.\nOur Class A common stock and warrants are currently listed on the Nasdaq. Continued listing of a security on Nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards. We were subject to an initial monitoring period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A), during which time if we evidence a closing bid price of less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days at any point prior to the expiration of the monitoring period (the \u201cRule\u201d), we would be subject to a potential delisting. On September 7, 2021, we received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that we had failed to maintain compliance with the Rule and would therefore be delisted. We appealed this determination pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq rules and implemented a reverse stock split effective on September 30, 2021. Our appeal was heard by a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d) on October 14, 2021.\nOn October 22, 2021, we received a letter from the Nasdaq notifying us that we had regained compliance with the Rule. Accordingly, the Panel determined to continue the listing of shares of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq and closed the matter.\nHowever, the Panel also determined to impose an additional monitoring period (the \u201cMonitor Period\u201d), pursuant to Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A). During the Monitor Period, which lasts until October 24, 2022, we are required to notify the Panel, in writing, in the event of a closing bid price below $1.00 on any trading day, and/or in the event we fall out of compliance with any other applicable listing requirement. Should we evidence a closing bid price of under $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days at any point during the Monitor Period, the Panel (or a newly convened Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable) will provide written notice to us that it will promptly conduct a hearing with regards to this deficiency. We will have the opportunity to respond and present to the Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A). Our securities may at that time be delisted from Nasdaq. In the event that we fail to comply with any other requirement for continued listing during the Monitor Period, we will be provided written notice of the deficiency and an opportunity to present a definitive plan to the Panel to regain compliance. The Panel will thereafter render a determination with respect to our continued listing on Nasdaq.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If our Class A common stock was to be delisted from Nasdaq, trading of our common stock most likely would be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the OTCQX Market, OTCQB Market or OTC Bulletin Board. Such trading would likely reduce the market liquidity of our Class A common stock. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our Class A common stock. If our Class A common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and the trading price remains below $5.00 per share, trading in our Class A common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on Nasdaq that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low-priced stocks to their clients. Moreover, various regulations and policies restrict the ability of stockholders to borrow against or \u201cmargin\u201d low-priced stocks and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls. Additionally, because brokers\u2019 commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks, the current price of the Class A common stock can result in an individual stockholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher. This factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our Class A common stock. Finally, the additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from facilitating trades in our Class A common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our Class A common stock. As a result, the ability of our stockholders to resell their shares of Class A common stock, and the price at which they could sell their shares, could be adversely affected. The delisting of our Class A common stock from Nasdaq would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increases costs and distracts management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are subject to laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of Nasdaq, including the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations require us to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that we would not otherwise incur as a private company.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges, establish certain requirements for the corporate governance practices of public companies. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have additional board committees and are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required.\nWe rely on a small number of key personnel to manage compliance with these regulations, and compliance with such regulations causes additional costs to our operations and diverts management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal control over financial reporting, accounting systems disclosure controls and procedures, auditing functions and other procedures related to public company reporting to meet our reporting obligations as a public company.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will result in significant savings.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years or until such earlier time that we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Further, there is no guarantee that the exemptions available to us under the JOBS Act will result in significant savings. To the extent we choose not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may impact earnings and result in further diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\nAn active, liquid, and orderly trading market for our securities may not be maintained, which could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nAn active, liquid, and orderly trading market for our securities may not be maintained. Active, liquid, and orderly trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. The market price of our securities could vary significantly because of several factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our securities, you could lose a substantial portion or all your investment in our securities.\nThe following factors could affect the price of our securities:\n\u2022quarterly variations in our financial and operating results;\n\u2022public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022strategic actions by our competitors;\n\u2022the failure of securities or industry analysts to cover our securities or publish research or reports about us, our business, or our market;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022sales of our securities by us or our stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022the volume of our securities available for public sale;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022actions by our stockholders;\n\u2022general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022domestic and international economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022the realization of any risks described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the \u201cSecond Amended and Restated Charter\u201d) authorizes us to issue 400,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, of which 77,093,277 shares were outstanding as of March 15, 2022, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 19,610 shares of Series A preferred stock were outstanding as of March 15, 2022. The holders of the Series A preferred stock have the right to convert all or any portion of their shares of Series A preferred stock into 1,199,083 shares of Class A common stock. As of March 15, 2022, warrants to purchase up to 34,688,980 shares of our Class A common stock were outstanding and exercisable. As of March 15, 2022, we had $126.9 million of principal, including PIK interest, outstanding of the Convertible Senior Notes, which are convertible into 28,791,718 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock at the option of the holders.\nA large percentage of our shares of our Class A common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. We entered into registration rights agreements with certain of those investors in connection with the Transaction and in connection with their subsequent purchase of Series A preferred stock and the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes pursuant to which we have filed registration statements with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them.\nWe may issue shares of our Class A common stock or other securities from time to time pursuant to our at-the-market offering or as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. We may issue a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock in the at-the-market offering and, additionally, if any future acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our Class A common stock, or amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue in connection with such acquisition or investment may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our Class A common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future sales of our Class A common stock will have on the price at which our Class A common stock trades or the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities.\nCertain of our principal stockholders have significant influence over us.\nA large percentage of our shares of Class A common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors whose interests may conflict with that of our other common stockholders. Consequently, these holders (each of whom we refer to as a \u201cprincipal stockholder\u201d) may have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our Board, any amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership and the rights of our principal stockholders will limit the ability of our other common stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, actions may be taken that they may not view as beneficial.\nFurthermore, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our principal stockholders and their respective affiliates, including portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. Several of our principal stockholders are private equity firms or investment funds in the business of making investments in entities in a variety of industries. As a result, our principal stockholders\u2019 existing and future portfolio companies may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. Our Second and Amended and Restated Charter provides that our directors and officers, including any of the foregoing who were designated by our principal stockholders, do not have any obligation to offer to us any corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware prior to offering such opportunities to other entities with which they may be affiliated, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nWe may amend the terms of our Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants. As a result, the exercise price of these warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of our Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, without approval by all of the warrant holders.\nAs of March 15, 2022, we had 9,994,635 Public Warrants and 9,172,782 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. Our Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nWe may redeem unexpired Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their Public Warrants worthless.\nWe can redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of\u2009$0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of redemption, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $84.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If, and when, the Public Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants could force the warrant holders (i) to exercise their Public Warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their Public Warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their Public Warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by Matlin & Partners Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (\u201cM&P LLC\u201d) or its permitted transferees.\nThe exercise of our outstanding warrants or conversions of our outstanding Series A preferred stock or Convertible Senior Notes could increase the number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of March 15, 2022, warrants to purchase up to 34,688,980 shares of our Class A common stock were outstanding and exercisable. As of March 15, 2022, 19,610 shares of Series A preferred stock were outstanding and convertible into 1,199,083 shares of Class A common stock. The holders of the Series A preferred stock have the right to convert all or any portion of their shares of Series A preferred stock into shares of Class A common stock. As of March 15, 2022, we had $126.9 million of principal, including PIK interest, outstanding of the Convertible Senior Notes, which are convertible into 28,791,718 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock at the option of the holders.\nTo the extent such warrants are exercised or such Series A preferred stock or Convertible Senior Notes are converted, additional shares of our Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of our Class A common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of the Class A common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Charter and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to and desirable by our stockholders, including:\n\u2022a classified Board of Directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022 removal of directors by our stockholders only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2\u22153% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class;\n\u2022 adoption, amendment or repeal of our bylaws by our stockholders only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2\u22153% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class;\n\u2022 amendment or repeal of the supermajority voting provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Charter described above only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2\u22153% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, in addition to any other vote of stockholders required by the Second Amended and Restated Charter or applicable law;\n\u2022 inability of our stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent; and\n\u2022 advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to our Board of Directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (\u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or employees of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Second Amended and Restated Charter or our bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case except for such claims as to which (a) the Court of Chancery determines that it does not have personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party, (b) exclusive jurisdiction is vested in a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (c) the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Although the Certificate of Incorporation contains the choice of forum provision described above, we do not expect this choice of forum provision will apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Charter described in the preceding paragraph. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Additionally, a court could determine that the exclusive forum provision is unenforceable. If a court were to find these provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA pandemic or epidemic, including the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, and the regulatory steps to reduce its transmission has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe, and is impacting worldwide economic activity, including the global demand for oil and natural gas. A pandemic, including the COVID-19 or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities, including quarantines of certain geographic areas, restrictions on travel and other restrictions that prohibit employees from going to work. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related mitigation measures has resulted and may continue to result in a significant decrease in business from our customers and/or cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. If the responses to contain the COVID-19 are unsuccessful in bringing the pandemic to end, we could continue to experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompetition within the oilfield services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive and includes several large companies that compete in many of the markets we serve, as well as numerous small companies that compete with us on a local basis. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources allow them to better withstand industry downturns and compete more effectively because of technology, geographic scope and retained skilled personnel. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the market areas we serve are price, equipment quality, supply chains, balance sheet strength and financial condition, product and service quality, safety record, availability of crews and equipment and technical proficiency. Our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices, or other characteristics than our products and services or expand into service areas where we operate. Competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition, particularly during industry downturns. During such downturns, we experience reductions in the prices we can charge for our services based on reduced demand and resulting overcapacity, including an intensified competitive environment because of an industry downturn and oversupply of oilfield services. Any inability to compete effectively with our competitors or overcapacity in the markets which we serve could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyberattacks or other security breaches, or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience because of such cyberattacks.\nWe may be unable to employ enough key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers. In addition, the absence or loss of certain key employees could adversely affect our business.\nThe delivery of our services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. Additionally, our ability to successfully operate our business is dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including our senior management. The demand for skilled workers in our areas of operations can be high, the supply may be limited, and we may be unable to relocate our employees from areas of lower utilization to areas of higher demand. If we are unable to retain or meet growing demand for skilled technical personnel, our operating results, and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be adversely affected. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. Further, a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand could result in a reduction of the available skilled labor force, and there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve following a subsequent increase in demand for our services or an increase in wage rates.\nWe are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, and require full compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and other laws concerning immigration and the hiring of legally documented workers. In some cases, it may be necessary to obtain a required work authorization from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or similar government agency prior to a foreign national working as an employee for us. There may be costs that arise during our efforts to comply with various current or future labor and employment related regulations.\nIn addition, many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The unexpected loss or unavailability of key members of management or technical personnel, one or more members of our executive team, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief administrative officer, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nAnti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Texas, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, and results of operations.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays, or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if wells, operations sites or other related facilities are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the domestic E&P industry which, as described above, is subject to volatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining permits by us for our operations or by our customers for their operations could impair our business.\nOur operations and the operations of our oil and natural gas producing customers require permits from one or more governmental agencies to perform drilling and completion activities, secure water rights, or engage in other regulated activities. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such regulated activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas of the United States may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us, and adversely affecting our results of operations in support of those customers.\nWe may be negatively impacted by inflation.\nIncreases in inflation may have an adverse effect on us. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies. Continuing increases in inflation could impact the commodity markets generally, the overall demand for our services, our costs for labor and material and the margins we are able to realize on our services, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation may also result in higher interest rates, which in turn would result in higher interest expense related to our variable rate indebtedness and any borrowings we undertake to refinance existing indebtedness.\nRising interest rates may adversely impact our business.\nDue to recent increases in inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rates. An increase in the federal benchmark rate could result in an increase in market interest rates, which may increase our interest expense under our variable-rate borrowings and the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt. Consequently, rising interest rates will increase our cost of capital. Historically, we have utilized our debt arrangements to fund our capital expenditures and operations. Due to potential interest rate increases resulting from the current global economic environment, we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness or adversely impact our ability to issue new debt. As a result, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available if needed and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse effect on us.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by several factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock and public warrants are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.", "PERMNO": 16674, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "USWS"}
