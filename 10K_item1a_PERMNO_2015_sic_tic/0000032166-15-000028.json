{"cik": "32166", "company": "ELECTRO RENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties, as well as the other information in this report and in other reports and documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, when evaluating our business and future prospects. We believe that the following risk factors are the most relevant to our business, but they are not the only risk factors that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also occur. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our Common Stock could decline, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nCOMMON STOCK PRICE FLUCTUATIONS\nThe price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\nGeneral Factors. We believe some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock have included:\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning new products or enhancements in the equipment that we rent, or developments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the expiration of the Keysight reseller agreement and the establishment of new reseller or sales agent arrangements;\n\u2022\nvariations in our revenues, gross margins, earnings or other financial results from investors\u2019 expectations; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in results of our operations and general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers.\nIn addition, prices in the stock market in general have been volatile in recent years. In many cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our Common Stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.\nFuture Sales of our Common Stock. Sales of our Common Stock by our officers, directors and employees could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of our shares. Additionally, the price could be affected by even the potential for sales by these persons. In addition to the 24,108,816 shares outstanding as of August 13, 2015, as of such date, up to 507,340 shares of Common Stock may be issued upon conversion of our vested and unvested restricted stock units previously granted under our Equity Incentive Plan.\nWe cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our Common Stock, or the potential for those sales, will have on the share price for our Common Stock.\nFLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated from period to period, and we expect that fluctuations could continue in the future. The fluctuations in our past results have resulted from many factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the future, these or other factors could have a material impact on our operating results and the price of our Common Stock.\nTiming of Equipment Purchases and Sales and Equipment Pool Management. The profitability of our business depends in part on controlling the timing, pricing and mix of purchases and sales of equipment and on managing our equipment pool. We seek to acquire new and used equipment at attractive prices, from which we feel we can make a profit as a result of a combination of renting, leasing and selling that equipment. We base expenditures for equipment purchases, sales and marketing and other items on our expectations of future customer demand. In order to maximize overall profit from the rental, leasing, and sales of equipment, we manage our equipment pool on an on-going basis by analyzing our product strategy for equipment in light of historical and projected lifecycles. In doing so, we compare our estimate of potential profit from rental with the potential profit from the product\u2019s immediate sale and replacement with new or other equipment.\nOur overall equipment management is complex and our equipment strategy can change during the equipment\u2019s lifetime based upon numerous factors, including the U.S. and global economy, interest rates and new product launches. Our strategic equipment decisions are based on the following fundamentals:\n\u2022\nour acquisition cost;\n\u2022\nour estimates of current and future market demand for rentals;\n\u2022\nour estimates of current and future supply of equipment;\n\u2022\nthe book value of the equipment after depreciation and other impairment;\n\u2022\nour estimates of the effect of interest rates on rental and leasing fees as well as capital financing; and\n\u2022\nour estimates of the potential current and future sale prices of equipment.\nHowever, historical trends are not necessarily indicative of future trends. If our assumptions prove to be wrong, not only may our revenues fall short of our expectations, but we may not be able to adjust our equipment quickly enough to compensate for\nlower demand for one or more products in our equipment pool. In addition, as demand for a product falls, we may have difficulty in selling any of our excess equipment at a favorable price or at all. Both of these factors can compound the impact of any revenue shortfall and further affect our operating results and the price of our Common Stock.\nEconomic Conditions. Demand for our rental products depends on continued business activity. In recent years, our financial results have been impacted by competitive pressure on rental rates primarily due the lingering effects of the recent credit crisis and economic recession in the U.S. Our customers historically have reduced their expenditures for T&M and DP equipment during economic downturns. Accordingly, when the domestic and/or international economy weakens, demand for our products declines. A large part of our equipment pool is rented or leased to customers in the aerospace and defense, telecommunications, electronics, industrial and semiconductor markets. Uncertainly in U.S. or global economy, or in one or more of specific markets we serve, may result in lower demand and increased pressure on prices and gross profit.\nWhile the U.S. economy has emerged from the recession, if the economy experiences another recession, reduced demand for our rental products could increase price competition and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nWe continue to focus on remaining profitable in the current conditions, as well as being prepared for the possibility that recessionary trends may return in future periods.\nOther Factors. Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation based on a wide variety of factors. Other factors that may affect our operating results from one quarter to another include:\n\u2022\nchanges in customer demands and/or requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing or maintenance policies of equipment manufacturers;\n\u2022\nprice competition from other rental, leasing and finance companies;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product announcements and launches;\n\u2022\nmix of rental versus resale revenues;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in product delivery dates;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations and other risks of international operations; and\n\u2022\nchanges and reductions to government spending that could negatively impact our customers in the aerospace and defense industry.\nAll or any of these factors and similar factors could result in our operating results differing substantially from our expectations, as well as the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have a material adverse impact on our stock price.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGY CHANGES\nWe serve customers that operate in markets that are characterized by technological change, and accordingly must anticipate and respond to changes in technology in order to maintain competitiveness and successful operations.\nTechnological Advancements. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. The equipment that we acquire for our equipment pool can be subject to technological change, evolving customer demands and frequent new product announcements and enhancements. If we fail to adequately anticipate or adapt to new technological developments or to recognize changing market conditions, our operating results and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nExpenses Resulting from Technological Advancements. As a result of technology developments, we may have to make substantial and unanticipated expenditures to acquire new equipment or invest in further staff education on operating and servicing the equipment we deliver to our customers. Further, we may not adequately anticipate or respond successfully to technological changes for many reasons, including misjudging the impact of technological changes as well as financial, technological or other constraints. If we do not adequately anticipate or respond to changes in technological advancements or customer preferences, it would likely have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nIntroduction of New Products and Services. The markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technology, evolving industry standards and declining prices of certain products. Our operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to introduce new products and services and to control and/or reduce costs. Whether we succeed in our new offerings depends on several factors such as:\n\u2022\nproper identification of customer needs;\n\u2022\nappropriate control of costs;\n\u2022\ntimely completion and introduction of products and services as compared to our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to differentiate our equipment and services from our competitors; and\n\u2022\nappropriate pricing and market acceptance of our solutions.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER SOLVENCY\nOur customers may face liquidity issues and, if we make poor credit decisions or are unable to collect on contracts with customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOne of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent or lease electronic equipment instead of owning that equipment is because renting or leasing enables them to deploy their capital elsewhere. However, some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us. If we are not able to manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses would increase above historical levels and may become material.\nCOMPETITION\nIf we do not compete effectively, we may lose market share and our revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe equipment rental, leasing and sales business is characterized by intense competition from several large competitors, some of which have access to greater financial and other resources. We face competition from both established entities and new entries in the market. Our primary competitors in the North American T&M rental area include McGrath RentCorp, Continental Resources, Inc., Test Equity LLC and Microlease plc. Internationally, our largest European competitors for rental business are Microlease plc and Livingston Group Ltd., which was acquired by Microlease in November, 2014. These entities also compete with us in leasing T&M equipment, as do banks, vendors and other financing sources. In addition, in equipment sales, we also compete with sales by our suppliers, including Keysight, Anritsu, Rohde and Tektronix, and their other distributors. The market for the lease and rental of computers is highly fragmented, and our principal competitors include SmartSource, Rentex, Rentfusion and Vernon Computer Source.\nOur competitors engage in aggressive pricing for both rentals and sales. In order to maintain or increase our market share, we may choose, or be compelled, to lower our prices, resulting in decreased revenues and profitability, which could materially and adversely affect our stock price.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nOur international operations will continue to be a meaningful portion of our overall revenues and operations in the future. There are risks that are inherent to our international operations and, if we fail to manage them appropriately, we may not meet our revenue expectations or may incur unanticipated expenses, either of which would adversely affect our operations.\nCurrency Risks. We generated 15.9% of our revenues from activity in foreign countries during the past fiscal year. Our contracts to supply equipment outside of the U.S. are generally priced in local currency. However, our consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars. Consequently, changes in exchange rates can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results, and could result in exchange losses. Although we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates, we may not be able to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations flowing through our operating results. Thus, exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nOther Risks Associated with International Operations. Additionally, our financial results may be adversely affected by other international risks, such as:\n\u2022\ninternational political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation in various countries;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing our foreign sales and service centers, and in training and retaining foreign employees;\n\u2022\nissues relating to the repatriation of any profits;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\ncosts associated with expansion into new territories.\nWe expect that our international operations and the revenues we derive from these activities will continue to be a meaningful portion of our total revenues. If we do not anticipate and respond to the risks associated with international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS\nOur business is dependent on our ability to purchase equipment for our equipment pool from third party manufacturers and suppliers at prices and on terms that allow us to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. Any significant change in availability, pricing or terms for equipment from our manufacturers could have a substantial impact on our results of operations.\nAbout 92% of our equipment portfolio at acquisition cost consists of general purpose T&M instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight, Rohde, Anritsu, and Tektronix. The remainder of our equipment pool consists of personal computers, workstations and tablets from Dell, Apple, IBM, Toshiba and HP. We depend on these manufacturers and suppliers for our equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner or for a price that generates a profit. Depending on the equipment required, or the customer\u2019s specific requirements, there may not be suitable alternatives from other suppliers. Any inability to acquire equipment would adversely impact our revenues. Similarly, if we cannot increase our pricing commensurate with pricing changes from our customers, our gross profit and income from operations will be adversely impacted.\nThe expiration of the Keysight reseller agreement on May 31, 2015 will significantly and negatively impact our revenue and net profits. There is no assurance that we will be able to replace the Keysight reseller arrangement with other reseller arrangements or that we will retain our key sales employees.\nIn fiscal 2010, we became a reseller of Agilent Technologies, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cAgilent\u201d) new T&M equipment in the U.S. and Canada. As of November 1, 2014, Agilent spun off Keysight Technologies, Inc. (\"Keysight\"), its wholly-owned subsidiary that manufactures T&M equipment, into a separate publicly traded company. Sales of new Keysight equipment represented approximately 29.5%, 26.5% and 29.8% of our gross revenue in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. On March 3, 2015, we announced that our reseller agreement with Keysight would not be renewed after its May 31, 2015 expiration date. The expiration of the Keysight reseller agreement has negatively impacted our stock price, and is expected to significantly and negatively impact our revenue and net profits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into agreements with other manufacturers of equipment, including Anritsu and ART-Fi SAS, so that we can replace some of the revenue associated with our Keysight reseller agreement. There can be no assurance that we will replace all or a significant portion of the revenue from the Keysight reseller agreement with relationships with other manufacturers. There is also no assurance that we will be able to retain our key sales personnel, the loss of which may impact our ability to support agreements with other equipment manufacturers. If we are unable to effectively manage the arrangements with other equipment manufacturers or retain our key sales employees, our operating results and stock price may be further materially and adversely affected.\nDEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued services of our executive officers, our senior managers and other key personnel. T&M equipment and solutions can be highly technical and complex, and typically require customizations to meet specific customer applications and needs. The quality of our customer service and the knowledge of our personnel is a key competitive factor for our business. It is very important that we attract highly skilled personnel to accommodate growth and to replace personnel who leave. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, especially in technology industries, and there is a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience to market, sell and service our equipment. We must retain and recruit qualified personnel in order to maintain and grow our business.\nCONTROL BY MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS\nSenior management has significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions.\nAs of August 13, 2015, our executive officers and directors collectively owned approximately 21.1% of our Common Stock.\nAs of that date, (i) Mr. Daniel Greenberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 19.0% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (ii) one other shareholder controlled 15.9% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As long as these shareholders own a significant percentage of our Common Stock, they will be able to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs and may be in a position to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval. These may include, for example, the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our corporate documents and the approval of mergers and sales of our assets.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS AND NEW BUSINESS VENTURES\nIf we fail to accurately assess and successfully integrate any recent or future acquisitions or new business ventures, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, which could result in lower revenues, unanticipated operating expenses, reduced profitability and dilution of our book value per share.\nWe could decide to pursue one or more opportunities by acquisition or internal development. Acquisitions and new business ventures, both domestic and foreign, involve many risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired operations and personnel with our existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of evaluating, negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures;\n\u2022\nour exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees of an acquired operation.\nIn addition, an acquisition or new business venture could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute shareholder interests, for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ncharges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill;\n\u2022\ninterest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and\n\u2022\nany issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current shareholders.\nWe have implemented various new business ventures in the past, and not all of such ventures have been successful. The risks associated with acquisitions and new business ventures could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATES\nInterest rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stock price.\nOur leasing yields tend to correlate with market interest rates. When interest rates are higher, our leasing terms incorporate a higher financing charge. However, in times of relatively lower interest rates our financing charges also decrease, and some of our customers choose to purchase new equipment, rather than to lease. Lower leasing yields result in lower rental and lease revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING\nWe have customers in the aerospace and defense industry that derive a significant amount of revenue from the U.S. government. If the U.S. government were to substantially curtail spending for the aerospace and defense industry, it would have a significant negative effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe U.S. federal government has implemented significant changes and reductions to government defense spending. In addition, uncertainty resulting from previously announced defense spending reductions and the potential future additional reductions have impacted, and are likely to continue to impact, the manner in which our customers in the aerospace and defense industry make procurement decisions, resulting in reduced demand by such customers in our rental services and resale business. A shift in government priorities to government programs in which our customers do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or the termination of government programs in which our customers do participate, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on the demand of our services and products and, as a consequence, our revenues, operating results and stock price.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS\nFailure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements and negatively impact our stock price.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. Compliance with Section 404 and other related requirements has increased our costs and will continue to require additional management resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements. While our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2015 was effective, there is no assurance that future assessments of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting will be favorable. If we are unable to obtain future unqualified reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS\nThe anti-takeover provisions contained in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and in California law could materially and adversely impact the value of our Common Stock.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws and California law could, together or separately, discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so might benefit our shareholders. This may adversely impact the interests of our shareholders with respect to a potential acquisition and may also affect the price investors would receive for their shares of Common Stock. Some examples of these provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws are:\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are senior to the Common Stock, without prior shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\ncertain limitations of the rights of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders.", "PERMNO": 32046, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "ELRC"}
