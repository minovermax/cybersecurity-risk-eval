Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer.\nChanges in the funding priorities of the U.S. federal government, and changes in the way the U.S. federal government contracts with businesses, may materially and adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nSince the U.S. federal government is our largest customer, both directly and with us as a subcontractor, changes in the funding priorities of the U.S. federal government may materially and adversely affect us if funding is cut or shifted away from the information technology services that we are equipped to provide. Additionally, changes in the way the government awards contracts may create a disadvantage for us to compete in certain markets.\nTemporary or extended budget-related shutdowns of parts of the U.S. federal government may materially and adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nSince the U.S. federal government is our largest customer, both directly and with us as a subcontractor, budget impasses that lead to temporary or extended shutdowns of agencies of the U.S. federal government with which we contract or for which we provide services may adversely affect cash flow and earnings as we carry key personnel during periods in which they are unable to perform work which can be invoiced to the customers.\nU.S. federal government contracts are generally subject to terms more favorable to the customer than commercial contracts.\nU.S. federal government contracts generally contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the federal government to:\n\u25cf\nterminate our existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nreduce potential future income from our existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nmodify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts;\n\u25cf\nsuspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the federal government or with any specific government agency;\n\u25cf\nimpose fines and penalties;\n\u25cf\nsubject the award of some contracts to protest or challenge by competitors, which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest or challenge and which may also require the government to solicit new proposals for the contract or result in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract;\n\u25cf\nsuspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related task orders if the necessary funds are not appropriated by Congress;\n\u25cf\ndecline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiple year contract; and\n\u25cf\nclaim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nThe U.S. federal government may terminate a contract either \u201cfor convenience\u201d (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs or its desire to consolidate work under another contract) or if a default occurs by failing to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If the federal government terminates a contract based upon a default, we generally would be denied any recovery for undelivered work, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the federal government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source and other damages as authorized by law.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nThe failure to generate a sufficient level of professional fees will cause us to sustain losses.\nAlthough software sales constitute a significant part of our overall revenue, the gross profit we derive from such sales is very modest, generally less than three percent. Consequently, we are reliant on professional fee revenue to maintain and operate our business. Our number of professional fee engagements are limited and we have relied upon several key engagements to provide us with the level of revenue we require to breakeven or gain a modest degree of profitability. For example, in 2019, we were scheduled to commence work on a professional fee subcontract which should have enabled us to profitably operate for several years. The prime contract underlying this subcontract was protested which contributed to our loss in 2019. The protest was resolved at the contracting officer level in favor of our prime in March, 2020, but the protestor has indicated its intent to initiate a protest to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).. Even if our prime contractor prevails at GAO, the protestor can file a protest action at the Court of Federal Claims. Although the protestor and our prime contractor can resolve the protest, we are uncertain if any such resolution will occur, thereby leaving us in doubt as to when, if at all, we can commence providing services. In the absence of this subcontract, unless other professional fee engagements are obtained, we will continue to sustain losses.\nThe opportunities among our existing customers for forms modernization is nearing maturity.\nOver the last several years, we have modernized nearly all of the forms for which modernization was needed to meet compliance standards within agencies that have been our key electronic forms customers. While we continue to assist these customers with incremental changes on their internal and external forms, we must position ourselves to find forms business within some new agencies. While we do not anticipate a material effect on our overall results of operations, we may experience a material decline in revenue.\nWe are currently non-compliant with regard to our bank line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2019, we failed to maintain a minimum tangible net worth under a covenant with our lender. We have secured a waiver of the violation of the covenant from the lender. Our line of credit currently expires May 31, 2020. We are working with the lender to renew the line of credit, and anticipate changes in terms in light of our covenant violation. Failure to agree to terms on a renewal would leave us unable to borrow working capital, should the need arise, after May 31, 2020.\nOver half of our revenue is concentrated among a small number of contracts.\nThe loss of one or a few key contracts that represent large portions of our revenue could materially affect our revenue and our results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with a changing technological environment could negatively impact our business.\nThe computer industry in general, and the market for our application software offerings and services, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent new technology introductions, and significant competition. In order to keep pace with this rapidly changing market environment, we must continually develop and incorporate into our services new technological advances and features desired by the marketplace at acceptable prices. The successful development and commercialization of new services and technology involves many risks, including the identification of new opportunities, timely completion of the development process, the control and recovery of development and production costs and acceptance by customers of our products and services. If we are unsuccessful in identifying, developing and marketing our services and technology or adapting our business to rapid technological change, it will have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition from other companies engaged in software development and computer related services.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive, rapidly evolving, and can be affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Some of these companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition in other markets and a larger base of customers than IAI. In addition, some companies have well-established relationships with our current and prospective customers. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Should we not be able to maintain our competitive advantages in light of these factors, it could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the timeline for completion of contracts, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur commercial and federal government contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nContracts on which we utilize subcontractors or suppliers may be adversely affected if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform required obligations under the contract.\nWe frequently utilize subcontract labor on contracts where we lack specific functional expertise or where the subcontractor has brought the opportunity to us. If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform as specified, it may adversely affect our contracts and subject us to loss of the contracts, unintended expenses, and/or the inability to secure future contracts due to our nonperformance.\nOur federal government contracts typically have terms of one or more base years and one or more option years. Federal governmental agencies generally have the right not to exercise options to extend a contract. A decision to terminate or not to exercise options to extend our existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel to maintain our profitability and grow our business.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of our key personnel. A loss of certain key personnel, both managerial and technical, would most likely have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel throughout the industry is significant and we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract, integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we do not succeed in retaining our current personnel or in attracting and motivating new personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur software sales are subject to increasing price competition, fluctuation in demand, and our relationships with third-party software and software maintenance suppliers.\nFederal government customers are increasingly utilizing systems to accept software bids that make it easier for a larger number of sellers to participate in the bid process, which puts downward pressure on prices. At the same time, we obtain software licenses and related software maintenance contracts for resale from third-party suppliers. Increases in costs from these suppliers may affect our ability to bid winning prices to potential customers, which could have a material effect on software sales revenue. Also, any delay in our suppliers\u2019 fulfillment of our orders could impair our ability to deliver products and maintenance to customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nHealth epidemics, pandemics, and other natural disasters and national emergencies may have material adverse effects on our business.\nWe face various risks related to widespread health emergencies and natural disasters, including the global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus). If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. Effects experienced by our customers may effect the quantity of billable work we can perform, and effects experienced by our suppliers may impact our ability to deliver on our sales contracts. Opportunities to seek new business may be delayed indefinitely.\nWe are working with our employees, customers, suppliers, and community to monitor and assess the developing situation, and will continue to work to mitigate the effects on all parties. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition is uncertain.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nFluctuations in our results of operations from period to period may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nOur financial results vary from quarter to quarter based on certain factors such as the timing of significant orders, contract funding approvals and contract completions, some of which are beyond our control. As a consequence, our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results may fluctuate from period to period, and period comparisons may therefore not be meaningful. Such fluctuations in the future could contribute to corresponding fluctuations in our stock price and in certain cases cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nThe exercise of outstanding options to purchase our common stock could substantially dilute shareholders\u2019 investments.\nUnder the terms of outstanding options to acquire our common stock issued to employees and others, the holders thereof are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock that, upon the exercise of such options, could result in dilution in the interests of our other shareholders.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is presently quoted on the Over-the-Counter Markets (\u201cOTC\u201d) under the symbol \u201cIAIC\u201d, and the securities are traded through broker-dealers. Because our stock trades on the OTC Markets rather than on a national securities exchange, a shareholder may find it difficult to either dispose of or obtain quotations as to the price of our common stock. There has historically been a low trading volume of our shares which may have an adverse impact on a shareholder\u2019s ability to execute transactions of our shares.", "PERMNO": 85377, "SIC": 7371, "TIC": "IAIC"}
