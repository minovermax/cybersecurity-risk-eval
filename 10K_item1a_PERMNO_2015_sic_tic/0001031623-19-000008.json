{"cik": "1031623", "company": "GULF ISLAND FABRICATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements (see \"Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\"). These risk factors are important to understanding other statements in this Report. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d found elsewhere in this Report.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and stock price may be affected materially and adversely, in whole or in part, by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from historical operating results or those anticipated, projected or assumed in our forward-looking statements. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and stock price could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below.\nOur revenue and profitability may be impacted by the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and their contractors, alternative energy companies, marine companies operating in the GOM and along the Gulf Coast and federal, state and local governments. The level of activity by these parties has traditionally been volatile and they have been significantly impacted by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices continue to be depressed and have not increased to a level that supports a recovery in offshore exploration and production spending. In addition to the price of oil and gas, the levels of our customers\u2019 capital expenditures are influenced by, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate capital;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the U.S. and overseas;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate, size and location of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\ndemand for hydrocarbon production;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil and the level of production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nlocal, federal and international political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndemand for, availability of and technological viability of, alternative sources of energy;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production, transportation and consumption; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the U.S. energy policy, particularly any revision, reinterpretation or creation of environmental and tax laws and regulations that would negatively impact the oil and gas industry.\nThe above factors have not favored increased capital spending by offshore oil and gas companies in recent years. Further, although a reduction in gas prices has benefited capital spending for petrochemical and other facilities, the timing of, and our ability to secure, new project awards for this end market continues to be uncertain. As a result, there are fewer project awards to replace completed projects, and pricing of new contracts remains increasingly competitive.This creates challenges with respect to our ability to operate our fabrication facilities at desired utilization levels and may result in decreased revenue, lower margins, and losses in certain periods. Should industry conditions not improve, we may continue to suffer such decreased revenue, lower margins, and losses in future quarters. In addition, we believe that the downturn in the oil and gas industry has also adversely impacted many of our customers' businesses.\nWe are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity for the products and services we provide. Further, an increase in oil and gas prices may not necessarily translate into immediate or long- term increased activity, and even during periods of relatively high oil prices, our customers may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, particularly with respect to large, onshore shale production areas, could result in our historical customers allocating a higher percentage of their capital expenditure budgets to onshore exploration and production activities and we may not be successful securing new project awards related to these onshore activities. An increase in gas prices could also negatively impact future investments in petrochemical and other facilities that benefit from lower gas prices. These factors could cause our revenue and margins to remain depressed and limit our future growth prospects.\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive.\nThe onshore and offshore oil and gas industries and marine fabrication industries are highly competitive and influenced by events largely outside of our control. Contracts for our services are often awarded on a competitively bid basis, and our customers consider many factors when awarding a project. These factors include price, ability to meet the customer\u2019s schedule, the availability and capacity of equipment, and the reputation, experience, and safety record of the contractor. Although we believe we have an excellent reputation for safety and quality, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain our competitive position. In addition, we often compete with companies that have greater resources, which may make them more competitive for certain projects.\nCompetition with foreign competitors can also be challenging as such competitors often have lower operating costs and lower wage rates, and foreign governments often use subsidies and incentives to create local jobs, impose import duties and fees on products and tax foreign operators. In addition, as a result of technological innovations, decreased transportation costs incurred by our customers when exporting structures from foreign locations to the GOM may hinder our ability to successfully bid for projects in the GOM against foreign competitors. See \"Competition\" within Item 1 for further discussion of the competitive nature of our industry.\nOur customers are facing significant challenges and a period of consolidation within their industry.\nThe oil and gas industry is facing significant challenges due to a prolonged period of depressed oil and gas prices. This has also negatively impacted the marine industry that supports offshore exploration and production. Accordingly, many companies are unable to compete and, in some cases, are unable to pay their liabilities as they become due. This has resulted in many companies within the oil and gas and marine industries seeking bankruptcy protection or pursuing consolidation through mergers with, or acquisition by, other companies. We expect these trends to continue.\nThe consolidation of one or more of our primary customers, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers by a company that is not a customer, and a primary customer\u2019s acquisition of another company that provides services similar to those provided by us, could result in a reduction in such customers\u2019 capital spending and a decrease in the demand for our products and services. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain our level of revenue with a customer that has consolidated or replace lost revenue. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on contract pricing, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nWe are dependent upon the award of new contracts and the timing of those awards.\nIt is difficult to predict whether or when we will be awarded a new contract due to complex bidding and selection processes, changes in existing or forecast market conditions, governmental regulations, permitting and environmental matters. Because our revenue is derived from new project awards, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate materially from period to period as contracts are typically awarded on a project-by-project basis.\nThe timing of new project awards may reduce our short-term profitability as we balance our current capacity with expectations of future project awards. If an expected new project award is delayed or not received, we may incur costs to maintain an idle workforce and facilities, or alternatively, we may determine that our long-term interests are best served by reducing our workforce and incurring increased costs associated with termination benefits. A reduction in our workforce could also impact our results of operations if customers are hesitant to award new contracts based upon our staffing levels or if we are unable to adequately increase our labor force and staff projects that are awarded subsequent to workforce reductions.\nWe depend on significant customers for our revenue.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of customers, including U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international energy producers; petrochemical, industrial, power, and marine operations; EPC companies; and certain agencies of the U.S. government. Because the level of services that we may provide to any customer depends, among other things, on the amount of that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget and our ability to meet the customer\u2019s delivery schedule, customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue in one year may represent an immaterial portion of revenue in subsequent years. We define significant customers as those that individually comprise 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. For 2018, three customers accounted for 44% of our consolidated revenue. For 2017, two customers accounted for 39% of our consolidated revenue. For 2016, one customer accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenue. The loss of a significant customer in any given\nyear for any reason, including a sustained decline in that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget or competitive factors, could result in a substantial loss of revenue. See \"Customers\" in Item 1 for further discussion of our customers.\nWe are exposed to the credit risks of our customers, including nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers.\nThe concentration of our customers in the oil and gas and marine industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Our business could be impacted due to nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We believe certain of our customers finance their activities through cash flows from operations and debt or equity financing. Many of these customers are facing significant challenges within the current oil and gas market. As a result, many of our customers are facing decreased cash flows, a reduction in borrowing capacity, inability to access capital or credit markets, and a reduction in their liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we can provide no assurances that such reserves will be sufficient to cover uncollectible receivable amounts or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations.\nFurthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our key customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and similar International laws.\nThe nature of our contracting terms for our contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs is common in the fabrication and marine construction industries, a substantial number of our projects are performed on a fixed-price or unit-rate basis. Under fixed-price contracts, our contract price is fixed, subject to adjustment only for changes in scope by the customer. Under unit rate contracts, material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure. The unit rates of measure will generally be an amount of dollars per ton, per foot, per square foot or per item installed. A typical unit rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure. Profit margins are built into the unit rates and, similar to a fixed price contract, we retain cost savings but are also responsible for cost overruns. In many cases, our fixed-price and unit rate contracts involve complex design and engineering, significant procurement of equipment, supplies and extensive construction management. We employ best efforts to properly estimate the costs to complete our projects; however, our actual costs incurred to complete our projects could materially exceed our estimates. The revenue, costs and profit realized on a contract will often vary from the estimated amounts on which such contract was originally estimated due to the following:\n\u2022\nFailure to properly estimate costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\nChanges in the costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in engaging third-party subcontractors, equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers, or failures by third-party subcontractors, equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers to perform, resulting in project delays and additional costs;\n\u2022\nLate delivery of materials by our vendors or the inability of subcontractors to deliver contracted services on schedule or at the agreed upon price;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs due to poor execution or productivity and/or weather conditions;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated costs or claims, including costs for project modifications, delays, errors or changes in specifications or designs, regulatory changes or contract termination;\n\u2022\nUnrecoverable costs associated with customer changes in scope and schedule;\n\u2022\nPayment of liquidated damages due to a failure to meet contracted delivery dates;\n\u2022\nChanges in labor conditions, including the availability, wage and productivity of labor;\n\u2022\nTermination, temporary suspension or significant reduction in scope of our projects by our customers;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated technical problems with the structures, equipment or systems we supply;\n\u2022\nUnder-utilization of our facilities and an idle labor force; and\n\u2022\nChanges in general economic conditions.\nThese variations and risks are inherent within our industry and may result in revenue and profit that differ from those originally estimated and alter profitability or result in losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance can have a significant impact on our operating results for any quarter or year. In addition, substantially all of our contracts require us to continue work in accordance with the contractually agreed schedule (and thus,\ncontinue to incur expenses for labor and materials) notwithstanding the occurrence of a disagreement with customers over increased pricing and/or unresolved change orders or claim.\nCompetitive pricing common in the fabrication and marine construction industry may not provide sufficient protection from cost overruns.\nThe prices we charge for our services and the demand for such services are currently severely depressed. Even when industry conditions are favorable, we operate in a very competitive industry and as a result, we are not always successful in fully recovering our cost structure or realizing a profit. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity may enter the market, which also places pressure on the pricing of our services. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further affect our profitability.\nOur method of accounting for revenue using the percentage-of-completion method could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRevenue for our fixed-price and unit-rate contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Contract costs include direct costs, such as materials and labor, and indirect costs that are attributable to contract activity. Material costs that are significant to a contract and do not reflect an accurate measure of project completion are excluded from the determination of our contract progress. Revenue for such materials is only recognized to the extent of costs incurred. Revenue and gross profit for contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method can be significantly affected by changes in estimated cost to complete such contracts. Significant estimates impacting the cost to complete a contract include: costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor and subcontracts; labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontractor and supplier progress; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates, which could result in material changes to our Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nWe are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas.\nOur operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations due to weather conditions and daylight hours. We attempt to mitigate the impact on productivity from weather conditions through the use of our covered fabrication facilities. However, a significant amount of our construction activities take place outdoors. Accordingly, the number of direct labor hours worked generally declines in the winter months due to an increase in rain, colder temperatures and a decrease in daylight hours. The seasonality of oil and gas industry activity in the Gulf Coast region also affects our operations. Our offshore oil and gas customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of more favorable weather during such months. Further, the rainy weather, tropical storms, hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the GOM and along the Gulf Coast throughout the year may also affect our operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include curtailment of services, weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations, inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. Furthermore, our customers\u2019 operations may be materially and adversely affected by severe weather and seasonal weather conditions, resulting in reduced demand for services. Accordingly, our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, depending on factors outside of our control. As a result, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any quarter or combination of quarters. We believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage related to potential damage from weather. See \"Executive Overview and Summary\" in Item 7 for further discussion.\nOur backlog is subject to change as a result of suspension or termination of projects currently in backlog or our failure to secure additional projects.\nNew project awards represent expected revenue values of commitments received during a given period, including scope growth on existing commitments. A commitment represents authorization from our customer to begin work or purchase materials pursuant to a written agreement, letter of intent or other form of authorization. Backlog represents the unearned revenue of our new project awards and includes signed contracts that are temporarily suspended or under protest but represent future work that we believe will be performed. The revenue projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not be profitable.\nProjects included in our backlog are generally subject to delay, suspension, termination, or an increase or reduction in scope at the option of the customer, although the customer is required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination, suspension, or reduction in scope. Depending on the size of the project, the delay, suspension, termination,\nincrease or reduction in scope of any project could significantly impact our backlog and change the expected amount and timing of revenue recognized. We may be at greater risk of delays, suspensions and cancellations in the current low oil and gas price environment. In addition, where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default by failing to pay amounts owed to us. Accordingly, our backlog as of any date is an uncertain indicator of future results of operations.\nWe may need to obtain debt financing or new credit facilities or raise equity capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, contract commitments and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so or do so on favorable terms, which would impair our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy.\nIf our existing cash, cash equivalents, scheduled maturities of our short-term investments and cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contract commitments, and/or acquisition opportunities, we would be required to reduce our capital expenditures and/or forego certain contracts and/or acquisition opportunities or we would be required to fund such needs through debt or equity issuances or through other financing alternatives, including the sale of assets.\nWe have created our EPC Division to manage the potential SeaOne Project, offshore wind opportunities and other projects that may require engineering, procurement and construction and project management services. We are working to strengthen our internal project management capabilities through the hiring of additional personnel to service such projects. Additionally, we may be required to make capital investments in our existing or new facilities and increase our working capital to support our backlog or new project awards, including potential additional projects for the U.S. Navy, the potential SeaOne Project and potential offshore wind projects. The capital outlays and working capital required by us to execute such projects could exceed the availability under our Credit Agreement and we may not be able to obtain alternative debt financing or new credit facilities to fund any capital investment or working capital requirements.\nOur ability to successfully obtain debt financing or new credit facilities or raise equity capital in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results, and those factors may affect our efforts to obtain additional capital on terms that are satisfactory to us. If adequate capital is not available, or not available on beneficial terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other investment opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges. This could limit our ability to bid on new project opportunities, thereby limiting our potential growth and profitability.\nWe may not be able to amend our Credit Agreement or obtain debt financing or new credit facilities if and when needed on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, scheduled maturities of our short-term investments, and availability under our $40.0 million revolving credit facility with Hancock Whitney Bank (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Our available liquidity is impacted by changes in our working capital (excluding cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments) and our capital expenditure requirements. At December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $79.2 million and we had $37.1 million of available capacity under our Credit Agreement.\nThere are a number of potential negative consequences for the energy sector that may result if oil and gas prices remain depressed or decline or if oil and gas companies continue to de-prioritize investments in exploration, development and production, including the continued or worsening of outflow of credit and capital from the energy sector and/or energy focused companies, further efforts by lenders to reduce their exposure to the energy sector, the imposition of increased lending standards for the energy sector, higher borrowing costs and collateral requirements, or a refusal to extend new credit or amend existing credit facilities in the energy sector. These potential negative consequences may be exacerbated by the pressure exerted on financial institutions by regulatory agencies to respond quickly and decisively to credit risk that develops in distressed industries. All these factors may complicate our ability to achieve a favorable outcome in obtaining debt financing, negotiating new credit facilities or amending or extending our Credit Agreement.\nIn order to extend our Credit Agreement or secure debt financing or new credit facilities, if available, we may be required to provide collateral, pay higher interest rates and otherwise agree to more restrictive terms. Collateral requirements and higher borrowing costs may limit our long- and short-term financial flexibility, and any failure to obtain amendments to our Credit Agreement or to secure debt financing or new credit facilities on terms that are acceptable to us could jeopardize our ability to fund, among other things, capital expenditures and general working capital needs or meet our other financial commitments.\nWe may obtain letters of credit under our Credit Agreement (which will reduce our availability under our Credit Agreement) or surety bonds from financial institutions to provide to our customers in order to secure advance payments or guarantee performance under our contracts, or in lieu of retention being withheld on our contracts. With respect to a letter of credit under\nour Credit Agreement, any advance in the event of non-performance under a contract would become a borrowing under our Credit Agreement and thus a direct obligation. With respect to a surety bond, any advance payment in the event of non-performance is subject to indemnification of the surety by us, which may require us to borrow under our Credit Agreement. When a contract is complete, the contingent obligation terminates, and letters of credit or surety bonds are returned. Although we believe there is sufficient bonding capacity available to us from one or more financial institutions, such capacity is uncommitted, and accordingly, we can provide no assurances that necessary bonding capacity will be available to support our future bonding requirements. See Note 7 of our Financial Statements in Item 8 and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 7 for further discussion of our Credit Agreement and surety bonds.\nOur Credit Agreement contains operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nOperating and financial restrictions and covenants in our Credit Agreement could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our Credit Agreement restricts our ability to: (i) grant liens; (ii) make certain loans or investments; (iii) incur additional indebtedness or guarantee other indebtedness in excess of specified levels; (iv) make any material change to the nature of our business or undergo a fundamental change; (v) make any material dispositions; (vi) acquire another company or all or substantially all of its assets; (vii) enter into a merger, consolidation, or sale leaseback transaction; or (viii) declare and pay dividends if any potential default or event of default occurs.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we breach any of our covenants under our Credit Agreement, repayment of any amounts borrowed could be accelerated when potentially we would not have the liquidity to do so and our credit capacity for the issuance of letters of credit may be terminated. If this were to happen, we could be required to seek additional debt financing or new credit facilities at higher capital costs, significantly curtail our operations, defer execution of our strategy, sell assets at discounted prices, or a combination of any of the aforementioned. In addition, our obligations under our Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets (with a negative pledge on our real property), and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, our lender could seek to foreclose on such assets. See Note 7 of our Financial Statements in Item 8 and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 7 for further discussion of our Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, if we were to borrow under our Credit Agreement it could have a significant impact on our operations, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on any debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our Credit Agreement and increasing the risk that we may default on our Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain debt financing or new credit facilities for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other activities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nmaking us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our Credit Agreement are subject to variable interest rates.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.\nLower levels of offshore exploration and development activity and spending by our customers globally has had a direct and significant impact on our financial performance, financial condition and financial outlook. Our ability to fund our operations depends on our ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This, to a large extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry, including commodity prices, demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge for our services, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. During 2018, we had negative cash flows from operations, and this trend could continue if conditions in our industry continue or worsen. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 7 for further discussion of our business outlook.\nWe may not be able to sell our assets held for sale and / or any sales we consummate may not produce the desired results.\nAt December 31, 2018, our assets held for sale total $18.9 million and primarily consist of three 660-ton crawler cranes, a deck barge, two plate bending roll machines, panel line equipment and a 2,500-ton drydock. We can provide no assurances that we will successfully sell these assets, that we will do so in accordance with our expected timeline or that we will recover the carrying value of the assets. Additionally, any decisions made regarding our deployment or use of any sales proceeds we receive in any sale involves risks and uncertainties. As a result, our decisions with respect to such proceeds may not lead to increased long-term shareholder value. See Note 3 of our Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our assets held for sale.\nWe may be unable to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers or subcontractors, or recover claims made by us against customers or subcontractors.\nOur projects are generally complex, and we may encounter difficulties in design, engineering, schedule changes and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control, that affect our ability to complete projects in accordance with contracted delivery schedules or to otherwise meet contractual performance obligations. We may bring claims against customers for additional costs incurred by us as a result of customer-caused delays or changes in project scope initiated by our customers that are not part of the original contract scope. In addition, claims may be brought against us by customers relating to, among other things, alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of work. We may also incur claims with our subcontractors that are similar to those described above. These claims may be subject to lengthy and/or expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings and may require us to invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost increases pending resolution of the claims.\nOur employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nSafety is a leading focus of our business, and our safety record is critical to our reputation and is of paramount importance to our employees, customers and shareholders. We work on projects with large mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, and dangerous processes, which can place our employees and others in challenging environments. In addition, the failure of structures during and after installation can also result in personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and suspension of operations. Management is focused on the implementation of effective quality, health, safety, environmental and security procedures. If we fail to implement these procedures, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or lose their lives, and our projects may be delayed causing exposure to litigation or investigations by regulators.\nUnsafe conditions at project work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase project costs and raise our operating costs. In addition, our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria for eligibility to bid for contracts. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards, could result in lost project awards, customers and our ability to tender future bids.\nThese risks may be greater should we acquire companies that have not allocated sufficient resources and management focus on safety and have poor safety records requiring corrective actions during the integration process. This may result in liabilities before such corrective actions are implemented.\nThe limits on our insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability and costs.\nThe fabrication of structures and the services we provide involves operating hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and suspension of operations. In addition, due to the proximity to the GOM, our facilities are subject to the possibility of physical damage caused by hurricanes or flooding.\nIn addition, our employees may engage in certain activities, including interconnect piping and other service activities conducted on offshore platforms, activities performed on spud barges owned or chartered by us, and marine vessel fabrication and repair activities performed at our facilities and barges owned by us, that are covered in either the provisions of the Jones Act or USL&H. These laws make the liability limits established under state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and, instead, permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job-related injuries, with generally no limitations on our potential liability. For example, our ownership and operation of vessels and our fabrication and repair of customer vessels can give rise to large and varied liability risks, such as risks of collisions with other vessels or structures, sinking, fires and other marine casualties, which can result in significant claims for damages against both us and third parties. Litigation arising from any such occurrences may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe may be exposed to future losses through our use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers' compensation. We expect liabilities in excess of any deductible to be covered by insurance. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. To the extent we are self-insured, reserves are recorded based upon our estimates, with input from legal and insurance advisors. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change.\nChanges in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\nOur entry into a new line of business may not result in increased shareholder value.\nOur operations historically focused on offshore fabrication services for the oil and gas industry. We have diversified our fabrication business through the pursuit of onshore fabrication opportunities, expanded and diversified our shipyard capability through the acquisition of a shipyard business in 2016, and expanded our EPC capability through the creation of our EPC Division to manage the potential SeaOne Project, offshore wind opportunities and other projects that may require EPC services. We may expand our capabilities further and enter into additional lines of business. Entry into, or further development of, lines of business in which we have not historically operated may expose us to business and operational risks that are different from those we have experienced historically. We may not be able to effectively manage these additional risks or implement successful business strategies in new lines of business. Additionally, our competitors in these lines of business may possess greater operational knowledge, resources and experience than we do. These diversification initiatives may not result in an increase in shareholder value and could result in a reduction in shareholder value depending upon our capital investment and success.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel to execute our projects.\nIn recent years we have reduced our skilled workforce in response to decreases in utilization of our facilities. Our productivity and profitability are significantly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled construction supervision and craft labor, primarily welders, fitters and equipment operators. Reductions in our labor force may make it more difficult to increase our labor force to desirable levels during periods of expanding customer demand and increases in our backlog. Our ability to expand our operations to support growth in our backlog is highly dependent on our ability to increase our labor force when necessary with an appropriate skilled construction workforce.\nIn addition, in periods of increased demand for construction labor, the supply of such labor becomes increasingly limited resulting in higher costs of labor, including increases in the wage rates as well as recruiting or training costs to attract and retain qualified employees. During previous periods of high activity, we have enhanced several incentive programs and expanded our training facility to maintain our workforce and attract new employees. During times of higher demand for our services, if qualified personnel become scarce, it could also increase our use of contract labor, which may have a higher cost and lower levels of productivity. Further, if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, we could incur difficulties performing our contracts and attracting new project awards. Moreover, any shortage of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could negatively affect the quality, safety and timeliness of our operations.\nOur success is dependent on key personnel.\nPart of our success depends on the abilities of our executives, management, and other key employees who have significant experience within our industry. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled personnel in various areas, including engineering, skilled laborers and craftsmen, project management, procurement, project controls and finance. The loss of one or more key personnel or our inability to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel could impact our operations. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees assumed in an acquisition, which may impact our ability to successfully integrate or operate the business acquired.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services to perform our contractual obligations and supply raw materials.\nWe rely on third parties to provide raw materials, and major components and to perform certain services required by our contracts. For example, we rely on steel purchased from domestic and foreign steel mills as well as subcontractors for the installation of electrical and mechanical testing of equipment. Disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations on a timely basis could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable\nto provide the agreed-upon products or materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner or otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements. The inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform could also result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers and subcontractors.\nWe depend upon subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nto perform work we would otherwise perform with our employees but are unable to do so as a result of scheduling demands;\n\u2022\nto supervise and/or perform certain aspects of the contract more efficiently considering the conditions of the contract; and\n\u2022\nto perform certain services that we are unable to do or which we believe can be performed more efficiently or at a lower cost by subcontractors.\nWe work closely with these subcontractors to monitor progress and address our customer requirements. However, the inability of our subcontractors to perform under the terms of their contracts could cause us to incur additional costs that reduce profitability or create losses on projects.\nThe costs to provide our products and services can increase over the terms of our contracts, including any increases in material costs. We may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions in some of our contracts. Even with these provisions, however, the difference between our actual material costs and these escalation provisions may expose us to cost uncertainty. In addition, we may experience significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials, which may occur as a result of availability or price.\nRecent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our fabrication projects.\nThe federal government recently imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with our fabrication business, including steel, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them), and has threatened to impose further tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our costs further, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies.\nThe nature of our industry subjects us to compliance with regulatory and environmental laws.\nOur operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of foreign, federal, state and local laws and other regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Compliance with many of these laws is becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive. These laws may impose \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to its negligence or fault. Certain environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, we could be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or acts for which we were in compliance with applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. We believe that our present operations materially comply with applicable federal and state pollution control and environmental protection laws and regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has not resulted in a material adverse effect on our operations. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results. See \u201cBusiness and Properties - Government and Environmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1 for further discussion.\nThe demand for our services is also affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations related to the oil and gas and marine industries. We may not be able to pass any potential increases in taxes on to our customers.\nOffshore construction and drilling in certain areas is opposed by many environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction\nand drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent future operations and results of operations may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to utilize the navigation canals adjacent to our facilities.\nOur shipyard and fabrication yards are located on the Houma Navigation Canal approximately 30 miles from the GOM and our services yard is located on a slip adjacent to the Houma Navigation Canal. The Houma Navigation Canal provides the shortest and least restrictive means of access from our facilities to open waters. Our shipyard in Jennings, Louisiana, is located on the west bank of the Mermentau River approximately 25 miles north of the U.S. Intracoastal Waterway and our shipyard near Lake Charles located 17 miles from the GOM on the Calcasieu River. All these waterways are navigable waterways of the U.S. and, as such, are protected by federal law from unauthorized obstructions that would hinder water-borne traffic. Federal law also authorizes maintenance of these waterways by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These waterways are dredged from time to time to maintain water depth and, while federal funding for dredging has historically been provided, there is no assurance that Congressional appropriations sufficient for adequate dredging and other maintenance of these waterways will be continued. If funding were not appropriated for that purpose, some or all of these waterways could become impassable by barges or other vessels required to transport many of our products.\nAny additional government shutdowns may adversely affect our business.\nA government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants or approvals. In addition, during the first quarter 2018, we executed a contract for the construction and delivery of one towing, salvage and rescue ship for the U.S. Navy with customer options for seven additional vessels. A government shutdown could result in a delay or cancellation of this project or result in our incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement from the government.\nSystems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nWe rely heavily on computer information, communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. From time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. In the event we are unable to deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption or release of data. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on us and our clients.\nIn addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. If we were to be subject to a cyber incident or attack, it could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or exposure to litigation, damage to equipment and other financial costs and losses. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, but they are still vulnerable to these threats. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches.\nWe may conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances over which we may have limited control, and our partners in such arrangements may not perform.\nWe recently entered into a cooperation agreement with Smulders. In the future we may conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances with business partners. In any such arrangement, differences in views among the participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on certain matters, or to do so in a timely manner. In any joint ventures or strategic alliance in which we hold a non-controlling interest, we may have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations. We also cannot control the actions of our partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our partners, and we would likely share liability or have joint and/or several liability with our partners for joint venture matters.", "PERMNO": 84737, "SIC": 3730, "TIC": "GIFI"}
