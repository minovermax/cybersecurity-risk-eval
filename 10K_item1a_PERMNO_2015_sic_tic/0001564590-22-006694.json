RISK FACTORS\n1.Risks Relating to Our Liquidity\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and may be required to take other actions to satisfy the obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, prevailing economic and competitive conditions, and certain financial, business and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows sufficient to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including the $500 million principal amount of our 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the \u201cNew Notes\u201d).\nIf cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and will need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt, the issuance of equity, asset sales or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unsuccessful, we will need to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of other assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance debt. These alternative measures may not be successful, may not be completed on economically attractive terms, or may not be adequate for us to meet our debt obligations when due. Additionally, our debt agreements limit the use of the proceeds from many dispositions of assets or operations. As a result, we may not be permitted to use the proceeds from these dispositions to satisfy our debt obligations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the outstanding principal and interest on our debt could be declared to be due and payable, in which case we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation or required to substantially restructure or alter our business operations or debt obligations. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nFurther, if we suffer or appear to suffer from a lack of available liquidity, the evaluation of our creditworthiness by counterparties and rating agencies and the willingness of third parties to do business with us could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, our credit ratings could be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely at any time by the rating agencies. Downgrades in our long-term debt ratings generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease and could trigger liquidity demands pursuant to the terms of contracts, leases or other agreements. Any future transactions by us, including the issuance of additional debt, the sale of any operating assets, or any other transaction to manage our liquidity, could result in temporary or permanent downgrades of our credit ratings.\nOur substantial indebtedness level could limit our financial and operating activities, and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As a result, this level could, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including our repurchase obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nmake us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nOur debt agreements and the Exchange Agreement contain covenants and restrictions that could restrict or limit our financial and business operations. A breach of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under one or more of our debt agreements or contracts at different entities within our capital structure, including as a result of cross acceleration or default provisions.\nOur debt agreements and the Exchange Agreement contain various covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, limit flexibility in operating our businesses. A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a significant portion of our debt becoming due and payable or could result in significant contractual liability. These covenants and other restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock, make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments or certain capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets to secure debt;\n\u2022\nengage in certain fundamental corporate changes or changes to our business activities;\n\u2022\nmake certain material acquisitions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nrepay, repurchase or modify certain subordinated and other material debt.\nThe Working Capital Revolver Loan also contains certain affirmative covenants and requires the borrowers to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Working Capital Revolver Loan) if their excess availability (as defined in the Working Capital Revolver Loan) falls below a certain level.\nThese covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns.\nIn addition, certain failures to make payments when due on, or the acceleration of, significant indebtedness constitutes a default under some of our debt instruments, including the indenture governing the notes. Further, a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions in a debt instrument could result in an event of default under such debt instrument. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under one of these debt instruments, our lenders or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such debt instrument to be immediately due and payable and/or terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders or noteholders could cause cross defaults or accelerations under our other debt. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders or noteholders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such debt. In the case of a default under debt that is guaranteed, holders of such debt could also seek to enforce the guarantees. If lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of all borrowings, we would likely not have sufficient assets and funds to repay those borrowings. Such occurrence could result in our or our applicable subsidiary going into bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency.\nThe age of our chemical manufacturing facilities increases the risk for unplanned downtime, which may be significant.\nOur business is comprised of operating units of various ages and levels of automated control. While we have continued to make significant annual capital improvements, potential age or control related issues have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, which could cause damage to the equipment and ancillary facilities. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience additional downtime at our chemical facilities in the future.\nThe equipment required for the manufacture of our products is specialized, and the time for replacement of such equipment can be lengthy, resulting in extended downtime in the affected unit. In addition, the cost for such equipment could be influenced by changes in regulatory policies (including tariffs) of foreign governments, as well as the U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment.\nAlthough we use various reliability and inspection programs and maintain a significant inventory of spare equipment, which are intended to mitigate the extent of production losses, unplanned outages may still occur. As a result, these planned and unplanned downtime events at our chemical facilities have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nLSB is a holding company and depends, in large part, on receiving funds from its subsidiaries to fund our indebtedness.\nLSB is a holding company with no significant operations or material assets other than the equity interests it holds in its subsidiaries and conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. As a result, LSB\u2019s ability to meet its obligations depends, in large part, on the operating performance and cash flows of its subsidiaries, which will be affected by general economic, industry, financial, competitive, operating and other factors beyond our control, and the ability of its subsidiaries to make distributions and pay dividends to LSB.\nEach of LSB\u2019s subsidiaries is a separate and distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of such subsidiaries, may limit LSB\u2019s ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. Any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to LSB by its subsidiaries could also be subject to taxes or restrictions on dividends or transfers under applicable local law in the jurisdictions in which LSB\u2019s subsidiaries operate.\n2.Risks Relating to Our Business\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have and may in the future disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCOVID-19 has evolved into a global pandemic and the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact. Currently, all of the facilities we own and operate have been designated as\nessential critical infrastructure based on guidelines issued by the United States Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Since we produce fertilizer products used by the agriculture industry, as well as chemical products required in a variety of industrial manufacturing processes, LSB has been determined to be a critical service, and therefore, our facilities are remaining in operation despite the evolving global health crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, if additional mandatory closures of businesses are imposed by the federal, state and local governments to control the spread of the virus, these closures could disrupt the operations of our management, business and finance teams. In addition, a significant downturn in global economic growth, or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions, may lead to reduced demand for a portion or all our products. Legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our financial performance and our ability to conduct our business.\nAn extended period of remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate cybersecurity risks. Our business depends on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems. We are also required to effect electronic transmissions with third parties including clients, vendors and others with whom we do business, and with our Board. We believe we have implemented appropriate security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls and procedures and perform third-party risk assessments; however, there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls and procedures will be effective, that we will be able to establish secure capabilities with all of third parties, or that third parties will have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of our information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation and potential liability.\nThe Omicron variant of COVID-19 began to spread rapidly across the globe in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and began to affect our business, as well as our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 business in similar ways as the initial surge of COVID-19. In addition, inflation and supply chain disruptions, in part exacerbated by the spread of the Omicron variant, have impacted companies and consumers in the United States. We have begun to experience increased inventory shipping costs and could see annual price increases from some of our vendors. In light of these trends, our management has taken, and will continue to take, a number of steps aimed to mitigate the impact of the Omicron variant, supply chain disruptions and inflation.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities, our business operations could be disrupted or delayed, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, and natural disasters (such as hurricanes, etc.), have negatively affected and could negatively affect U.S. and foreign companies, the financial markets, the industries where we operate, our operations and our profitability.\nTerrorist attacks in the U.S and elsewhere and natural disasters (such as hurricanes or pandemic health crises) have in the past and can in the future negatively affect our operations. We cannot predict further terrorist attacks and natural disasters in the U.S. and elsewhere. These attacks or natural disasters have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence, war or natural disasters could affect the industries where we operate, our ability to purchase raw materials, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters may directly affect our physical facilities, especially our chemical facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers and could affect our sales, our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers. In the past, hurricanes affecting the Gulf Coast of the U.S. have negatively affected our operations and those of our customers. As previously noted, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects, whether anthropogenic or otherwise, were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA major factor underlying the current high level of demand for our nitrogen-based fertilizer products is the production of ethanol. A decrease in ethanol production or an increase in ethanol imports could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.\nA major factor underlying the solid level of demand for our nitrogen-based fertilizer products is the production of ethanol in the United States and the use of corn in ethanol production. Ethanol production in the United States is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal statutes and regulations and is made significantly more competitive by various federal and state incentives and mandated usage of renewable fuels pursuant to the federal renewable fuel standards (\u201cRFS\u201d). To date, the RFS has been satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. However, a number of factors, including the continuing \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d debate and studies showing that expanded ethanol usage may increase the level of greenhouse gases in the environment as well as be unsuitable for small engine use, have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol, allow increased ethanol imports and to repeal or waive (in whole or in part) the current RFS, any of which could have an adverse effect on corn-based ethanol production, planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand. Therefore, ethanol incentive programs may not be renewed, or if renewed, they may be renewed on terms significantly less favorable to ethanol producers than current incentive programs. Therefore, a decrease in ethanol production or an increase in ethanol imports could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are reliant on a limited number of key facilities.\nOur nitrogen production is concentrated in four separate complexes. The suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and business.\nSeasonality can adversely affect our business.\nIf seasonal demand is less than we expect, we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored (in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs) or liquidated (in which case the selling price may be below our production, procurement and storage costs). The risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers. If prices for our products rapidly decrease, we may be subject to inventory write-downs, adversely affecting our operating results. If seasonal demand is greater than we expect, we may experience product shortages, and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us.\nWeather conditions adversely affect our business.\nThe products (primarily agricultural) produced and sold by us have been in the past, and could be in the future, materially affected by adverse weather conditions (such as excessive rain or drought) in the primary markets for our fertilizer and related agricultural products. In addition, weather can cause an interruption to the operations of our chemical facilities. Many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. These climate changes might also occur as the result of other phenomena that human activity is unable to influence, including changes in solar activity and volcanic activity. Regardless of the cause, if any of these unusual weather events occur during the primary seasons for sales of our agricultural products (March-June and September-November), this could have a material adverse effect on our agricultural sales and our financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate Change may adversely affect our business.\nOver the course of the past several years, global climate conditions have become increasingly inconsistent, volatile and unpredictable. Many of the regions in which we do business have experienced excessive moisture, cold, drought and/or heat of an unprecedented nature at various times of the year. In some cases, these conditions have either reduced or obviated the need for our products, particularly in the agriculture space, whether pre-plant, at-plant, post-emergent or at harvest. Due to the unpredictable nature of these conditions, growers and distributors appear to have become increasingly conservative in procurement practices and the accumulation of inventory. Further, the random nature of climactic change has made it increasingly difficult to forecast market demand and, consequently, financial performance, from year-to-year. There is no guarantee that climate change will abate in the near future, and it is possible that such change will continue to hinder our ability to forecast sales performance with accuracy and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business and customers are sensitive to adverse economic cycles.\nOur business can be affected by cyclical factors such as inflation, currency exchange rates, global energy policy and costs, regulatory policies (including tariffs), global market conditions and economic downturns in specific industries. Certain sales are sensitive to the level of activity in the agricultural, mining, automotive and housing industries. Therefore, substantial changes could adversely affect our operating results, liquidity, financial condition and capital resources.\nThere is intense competition in the markets we serve.\nSubstantially all of the markets in which we participate are highly competitive with respect to product quality, price, distribution, service, and reliability. We compete with many companies, domestic and foreign, that have greater financial, marketing and other resources. Competitive factors could require us to reduce prices or increase spending on product development, marketing and sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe compete with many U.S. producers and producers in other countries, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Some competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from chemical sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources sufficiently either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. An inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nAn increase of imported agricultural products could adversely affect our business.\nRussia, Ukraine and Trinidad have substantial capacity to produce and export fertilizers. Producers in these countries also benefit from below-market prices for natural gas, due to government regulation and other factors.\nIn addition, producers in China have substantial capacity to produce and export urea. Depending on various factors, including prevailing prices from other exporters, the price of coal, and the price of China\u2019s export tariff, higher volumes of urea from China\ncould be imported into the U.S. at prices that could have an adverse effect on the selling prices of other nitrogen products, including the nitrogen products we manufacture and sell.\nA substantial portion of our sales is dependent upon a limited number of customers.\nFor 2021, ten customers accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of, or a material reduction in purchase levels by, one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we are unable to replace a customer with other sales on substantially similar terms.\nA change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis, or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis, could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe offer our customers from time-to-time, the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose. Under our forward sales programs, customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales under their usual invoice terms when the performance obligation is satisfied. Forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related performance obligations are satisfied, which can take up to several months. We believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers. Our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources. In periods of rising fertilizer prices, selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis. Conversely, in periods of declining fertilizer prices, selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis. In addition, fixing the selling prices of our products, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time the performance obligation is satisfied.\nCost and the lack of availability of raw materials could materially affect our profitability and liquidity.\nOur sales and profits are heavily affected by the costs and availability of primary raw materials. These primary raw materials are typically subject to considerable price volatility, and recent global supply chain disruptions and increased inflation in the United States have led to further heightened volatility. Historically, when there have been rapid increases in the cost of these primary raw materials, we have sometimes been unable to timely increase our sales prices to cover all of the higher costs incurred. While we periodically enter into futures/forward contracts to economically hedge against price increases in certain of these raw materials, there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage against price fluctuations in those raw materials.\nNatural gas represents the primary raw material feedstock in the production of most of our chemical products. Although we enter into contracts with certain customers that provide for the pass-through of raw material costs, we have a substantial amount of sales that do not provide for the pass-through of raw material costs. Also, the spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not correlate to the cost of natural gas but rather reflect market conditions for similar and competing nitrogen sources. This lack of correlation can compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the products in this market. As a result, in the future, we may not be able to pass along to all of our customers the full amount of any increases in raw material costs. Future price fluctuations in our raw materials may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we depend on certain vendors to deliver natural gas and other key components that are required in the production of our products. Any disruption in the supply of natural gas and other key components could result in lost production or delayed shipments.\nThe price of natural gas in North America and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and had declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves, including shale gas, and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. However, recent disruptions in the global supply chain and increased inflation in the United States have led to reduced availability and increased prices of natural gas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, and they may continue to have an impact in the near term in fiscal year 2022. Future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated natural gas. Additionally, increased demand for natural gas, particularly in the Gulf Coast Region, due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices.\nWe have suspended in the past, and could suspend in the future, production at our chemical facilities due to, among other things, the high cost or lack of availability of natural gas and other key components, which could adversely affect our competitiveness in the markets we serve. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially affected in the future by the lack of availability of natural gas and other key components and increase costs relating to the purchase of natural gas and other key components.\nOur business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not be effective.\nWe may utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas, the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen-based products. We may use futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges to hedge our risk. Our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for, or to which we do not apply, hedge accounting. To the extent that our derivative positions lose value, we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties, adversely affecting our liquidity. We have also used fixed-price, physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility. Hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist. In addition, our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us. For example, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position. The counterparties to our derivatives are multi-national commercial banks, major financial institutions or large energy companies. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross-default provisions or credit support requirements. Additionally, the International Swaps and Derivative Association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross-default and/or acceleration provisions and credit support requirements. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. At other times we may not utilize derivatives or derivative strategies to hedge certain risks or to reduce the financial exposure of price volatility. As a result, we may not prevent certain material adverse impacts that could have been mitigated through the use of derivative strategies.\nOur transportation and distribution activities rely on third-party providers, which subject us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely on railroad, trucking, pipeline and other transportation service providers to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities, to coordinate and deliver finished products to our storage and distribution system and our retail centers and to ship finished products to our customers. These transportation operations, equipment and services are subject to various hazards, including adverse operating conditions, extreme weather conditions, system failures, work stoppages, equipment and personnel shortages, delays, accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards.\nIn the event of a disruption of existing transportation or terminaling facilities for our products or raw materials, alternative transportation and terminaling facilities may not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities. An extended interruption in the delivery of our products to our customers or the supply of natural gas, ammonia or sulfur to our production facilities could adversely affect sales volumes and margins.\nThese transportation operations, equipment and services are also subject to environmental, safety, and regulatory oversight. Due to concerns related to accidents, terrorism or increasing concerns regarding transportation of potentially hazardous substances, local, provincial, state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or our finished products. If transportation of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any third party\u2019s failure to operate properly or the other hazards described above, or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment, or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment, our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience increases in our transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors.\nFuture technological innovation could affect our business.\nFuture technological innovation, such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients, or developments in the application of crop nutrients, if they occur, could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and results of operations.\nCyber security risks could adversely affect our business.\nAs we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations, including as a result of remote work environments due to COVID-19, the risks associated with cyber security also increase. We rely on our enterprise resource planning software (\u201cERP\u201d) and other information systems, among other things, to manage our manufacturing, supply chain, accounting and financial functions. Additionally, third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business are also subject to cyber security risks. We are significantly dependent upon internet connectivity and a third-party cloud hosting vendor. We have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft, loss, damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events. Although we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Compromises to our information systems could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may engage in certain strategic transactions which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nAn important part of our business strategy is the acquisition of strategic assets or companies. Our management is currently evaluating and pursing certain such opportunities, and from time to time separately provides indications of interest in respect of similar transactions, which may be significant. Any such discussions may or may not result in the consummation of a transaction, and we may not be able to identify or complete any of these potential acquisitions. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of a transaction would have on the price of our securities. While the documents governing our indebtedness include certain restrictions on our ability to finance any acquisitions of new assets, such restrictions contain various exceptions and limitations.\nThere is no guarantee that any such transactions will be successful or, even if consummated, improve our operating results. We may incur costs, breakage fees or other expenses in connection with any such transactions or may not be able to obtain the necessary financing for such transactions on acceptable terms. Accordingly, any such transactions may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, any future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk of using management time and resources to pursue acquisitions that are not successfully completed;\n\u2022\nthe risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or business;\n\u2022\nthe risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nIf we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n3.Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nOur operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture, transportation, storage and distribution of chemical products, including some products that are highly toxic and corrosive. These hazards include, among other things, explosions; fires; severe weather and natural disasters; train derailments, collisions, vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks, pipelines and rail cars; spills, discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical failures; unscheduled plant downtime; labor difficulties and other risks. Some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations for an extended period of time and/or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. We periodically experience minor releases of ammonia related to leaks from our equipment. Similar events may occur in the future. As a result, such events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent and future legislative or regulatory requirements affecting our business may result in increased costs and decreased revenues, cash flows and liquidity or could have other negative effects on our business.\nOur business is subject to numerous health, safety, security and environmental laws and regulations. The manufacture and distribution of chemical products are activities that entail health, safety and environmental risks and impose obligations under health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. Although we believe we have established processes to monitor, review and manage our businesses to comply with the numerous health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, we previously were, and in the future, may be, subject to fines, penalties and sanctions for violations and substantial expenditures for cleanup costs and other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of effluents at or from our chemical facilities. Further, a number of our chemical facilities are dependent on environmental permits to operate, the loss or modification of which could have a material adverse effect on their operations and our results of operation and financial condition. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. In addition, third parties may contest our ability to receive or renew certain permits that we need to operate, which can lengthen the application process or even prevent us from obtaining necessary permits. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with permits, laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of noncompliance or permit interpretation is inherent in the operation of our business.\nThere can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of compliance.\nChanges to the production equipment at our chemical facilities that are required in order to comply with health, safety and environmental regulations may require substantial capital expenditures.\nExplosions and/or losses at other chemical facilities that we do not own (such as the April 2013 explosion in West, Texas) could also result in new or additional legislation or regulatory changes, particularly relating to public health, safety or any of the products manufactured and/or sold by us or the inability on the part of our customers to obtain or maintain insurance as to certain products manufactured and/or sold by us, which could have a negative effect on our revenues, cash flow and liquidity.\nIn summary, new or changed laws and regulations or the inability of our customers to obtain or maintain insurance in connection with any of our chemical products could have an adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may not have adequate insurance.\nWhile we maintain liability, property and business interruption insurance, including certain coverage for environmental contamination, it is subject to coverage limits and policies that may exclude coverage for some types of damages. Although there may currently be sources from which such coverage may be obtained, the coverage may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or the possible types of liabilities that may be incurred by us may not be covered by our insurance. In addition, our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies, or the dollar amount of the liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFurthermore, we are subject to litigation for which we could be obligated to bear legal, settlement and other costs, which may be in excess of any available insurance coverage. If we are required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of any litigation or investigation as a result of inadequate insurance proceeds, if any, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. For further discussion of our litigation, please see \u201cOther Pending, Threatened or Settled Litigation\u201d in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nWe may be required to modify or expand our operating, sales and reporting procedures and to install additional equipment in order to comply with current and possible future government regulations.\nThe chemical industry in general, and producers and distributors of ammonia and AN specifically, are scrutinized by the government, industry and public on security issues. Under current and proposed regulations, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs relating to security at our chemical facilities and distribution centers, as well as in the transportation of our products. These costs could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The cost of such regulatory changes, if significant, could lead some of our customers to choose other products over ammonia and AN, which may have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nThe \u201cSecure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007\u201d was enacted by the U.S. Congress, and subsequently the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) published a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2011. This regulation proposes to require sellers, buyers, their agents and transporters of solid AN and certain solid mixtures containing AN to possess a valid registration issued by DHS, keep certain records, report the theft or unexplained loss of regulated materials, and comply with certain other new requirements. We and others affected by this proposal have submitted appropriate comments to DHS regarding the proposed regulation. It is possible that DHS could significantly revise the requirements currently being proposed. Depending on the provisions of the final regulation to be promulgated by DHS and on our ability to pass these costs to our customers, these requirements may have a negative effect on the profitability of our AN business and may result in fewer distributors who are willing to handle the product. DHS has not finalized this rule, and has indicated that its next action, and the timing of such an action, is undetermined.\nOn August 1, 2013, U.S. President Obama issued an executive order addressing the safety and security of chemical facilities in response to recent incidents involving chemicals such as the explosion at West, Texas. The President directed federal agencies to enhance existing regulations and make recommendations to the U.S. Congress to develop new laws that may affect our business. In January 2016, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (\u201cCSB\u201d) released its final report on the West, Texas incident. The CSB report identifies several federal and state regulations and standards that could be strengthened to reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future. While the CSB does not have authority to directly regulate our business, the findings in this report, and other activities taken in response to the West, Texas incident by federal, state, and local regulators may result in additional regulation of our processes and products.\nIn January 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) finalized revisions to its Risk Management Program (\u201cRMP\u201d). The revisions include new requirements for certain facilities to perform hazard analyses, third-party auditing, incident investigations and root cause analyses, emergency response exercises, and to publicly share chemical and process information. Compliance with many of the rule\u2019s new requirements will be required beginning in 2021. The EPA temporarily delayed the rule\u2019s effective date however, the delay was subsequently vacated with an immediate effective date. On December 3, 2018, the EPA published a final rule that incorporates amendments to the RMP under 40 CFR Part 68. However, on November 21, 2019, EPA finalized its Risk Management Program Reconsideration Rule which rescinded third-party auditing, incident investigation and root cause analysis, and the public sharing of specific chemical and process information. The passage of the Reconsideration Rule has reduced the potential negative effect on the profitability of our AN business compared to the January 2017 RMP amendments. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) is likewise considering changes to its Process Safety Management standards. In addition, DHS, the\nEPA, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives updated a joint chemical advisory on the safe storage, handling, and management of AN. While these actions may result in additional regulatory requirements or changes to our operators, it is difficult to predict at this time how these and any other possible regulations, if and when adopted, will affect our business, operations, liquidity or financial results.\nProposed and existing governmental laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas and other air emissions may subject certain of our operations and customers to significant new costs and restrictions on their operations and may reduce sales of our products.\nOur chemical manufacturing facilities use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other raw materials necessary for the production of their chemical products that result, or could result, in certain greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. Federal and state legislatures and administrative agencies, including the EPA, are considering the scope and scale of greenhouse gas or other air emission regulation. Legislation and administrative actions have been considered that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions at some point in the future for our facilities, and existing and possible actions have already affected certain of our customers, leading to closure or rate reductions of certain facilities.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA adopted regulations pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various sources. For example, the EPA requires certain large stationary sources to obtain preconstruction and operating permits for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for such pollutants are also required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that are being established by the states. These regulatory requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.\nAlthough greenhouse gas regulation could: increase the price of the electricity and other energy sources purchased by our chemical facilities; increase costs for natural gas and other raw materials (such as ammonia); potentially restrict access to or the use of certain raw materials necessary to produce our chemical products; and require us to incur substantial expenditures to retrofit our chemical facilities to comply with the proposed new laws and regulations regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Federal, state and local governments may also pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may increase the cost of energy use in certain of our chemical and other manufacturing operations. For instance, the EPA published a rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, to limit greenhouse gases from electric power plants. The EPA is currently reviewing the Clean Power Plan however, it could result in increased electricity costs due to increased requirements for use of alternative energy sources, and a decreased demand for coal-generated electricity.\nLaws, regulations or other issues related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we, or other companies with which we do business become subject to laws or regulations related to climate change, it could have a material adverse effect on us. The United States may enact new laws, regulations and interpretations relating to climate change, including potential cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes and other requirements relating to reduction of carbon footprints and/or greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries have enacted climate change laws and regulations, and the United States has been involved in discussions regarding international climate change treaties. The federal government and some of the states and localities in which we operate have enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. Although these laws and regulations have not had any known material adverse effect on us to date, they could result in substantial costs, including compliance costs, monitoring and reporting costs and capital. Furthermore, our reputation could be damaged if we violate climate change laws or regulations. We cannot predict how future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of current laws and regulations, related to climate change will affect our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Lastly, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages and changing temperatures. Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.\n4.Risks Relating to Debt\nDespite our current levels of debt, we may still incur more debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment with our existing obligations, including secured debt, which would increase the risks described herein.\nThe agreements relating to our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the credit agreement governing our Working Capital Revolver Loan, limit but do not prohibit our ability to incur additional debt, including additional secured debt. Notwithstanding the fact that the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the credit agreement governing our Working Capital Revolver Loan limit our ability to incur additional debt or grant certain liens on our assets, the restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness and liens incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nBorrowings under our Working Capital Revolver Loan bear interest at a variable rate, which subjects us to interest rate risk and could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\nAll of our borrowings under our Working Capital Revolver Loan are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on this variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same. Although we may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to do so or that such swaps will be effective.\n5.Risks Relating to Human Capital\nLoss of key personnel could negatively affect our business.\nOur performance has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts of our principal executive officers. We cannot ensure that our principal executive officers will continue to be available. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our principal executive officers, including Mark T. Behrman and Cheryl A. Maguire, we do not have employment agreements with all of our key personnel. The loss of any of our principal executive officers could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.\nWe are subject to collective bargaining agreements with certain employees.\nApproximately 33% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on terms similar to current terms or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to us. The prolonged failure to renew or renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement could result in work stoppages. Additionally, if a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated at higher-than-anticipated cost, absorbing those costs or passing them through to customers in the form of higher prices may make us less competitive.\n6.Risks Relating to Shareholders\nCertain of our stockholders control a significant amount of our voting stock, and their interests could conflict with interests of other stockholders.\nLSB Funding LLC (\u201cLSB Funding\u201d), our largest voting shareholder, owned approximately 54 million shares of our common stock, which represent approximately 61% of the voting power of our common stock as of December 31, 2021, an aggregate of approximately 50 million shares of which were issued to LSB Funding in connection with the Exchange Transaction and the Special Dividend. As a result, LSB Funding could significantly influence our business and affairs if it chooses to use its significant voting power to do so. For instance, LSB Funding would be able to significantly affect most matters brought before the stockholders, including the election of all directors and the approval of mergers and other business combination transactions.\nPursuant to a Board Representation and Standstill Agreement, as amended, LSB Funding has the right to designate three directors on our Board, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. This is in addition to their ability to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, LSB Funding has significant influence over the election of directors to our Board.\nThe interests of LSB Funding may conflict with interests of other stockholders. As a result of the voting power and board designation rights of LSB Funding, the ability of other stockholders to influence our management and policies could be limited.\nWe are subject to a variety of factors that could discourage other parties from attempting to acquire us.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board and, except in limited circumstances, a two-thirds vote of outstanding voting shares to approve a merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets. In addition, we have entered into severance agreements with our executive officers and some of the executive officers of certain subsidiaries that provide, among other things, that if, within a specified period of time after the occurrence of a change in control of LSB, these officers are terminated, other than for cause, or the officer terminates his employment for good reason, the officer would be entitled to certain severance benefits. Certain of our preferred stock series and debt instruments also provide special rights in a change of control, including in some cases the ability to be repaid in full or redeemed.\nWe have authorized and unissued (including shares held in treasury) approximately 60.2 million shares of common stock and approximately 5.2 million shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 2021. These unissued shares could be used by our management to make it more difficult, and thereby discourage an attempt to acquire control of us.\nThe foregoing provisions and agreements may discourage a third-party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us and could have the effect of making it more difficult to remove incumbent management. In addition, LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders have significant voting power and rights to designate board representatives, all of which may further discourage a third-party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us.\nDelaware has adopted an anti-takeover law which, among other things, will delay for three years business combinations with acquirers of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of publicly-held companies (such as us), unless:\n\u2022\nprior to such time the Board of the corporation approved the business combination that results in the stockholder becoming an invested stockholder;\n\u2022\nthe acquirer owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock of such company prior to commencement of the transaction;\n\u2022\ntwo-thirds of the stockholders, other than the acquirer, vote to approve the business combination after approval thereof by the Board; or\n\u2022\nthe stockholders of the corporation amend its articles of incorporation or by-laws electing not to be governed by this provision.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years, and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in the near future. Our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has not made a decision whether or not to pay dividends on our common stock in 2022. In addition, there are certain limitations contained in our loan agreements that may limit our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding common stock.\nFuture issuances or potential issuances of our common stock or preferred stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings and could dilute the percentage ownership or voting power of our common stockholders.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, preferred stock or equity-related securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could dilute the value of common stock held by our existing stockholders. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of common stock, preferred stock, or equity-related securities, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Such future sales could also significantly reduce the percentage ownership and voting power of our existing common stockholders.\n7.General Risk Factors\nDeterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nA slowdown of, or persistent weakness in, economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways, among others: conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations; the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and affect our working capital; and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses. We also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers\u2019 reluctance to replenish inventories. The overall impact of a global economic downturn or reduced overall global trade on us is difficult to predict, and our business could be materially adversely impacted.\nIn addition, conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results. The international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. currency and its impact on the importation of fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies (including tariffs) of foreign governments, as well as the U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements contained within this report may be deemed \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.
