RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks together with all of the other information contained in this report in evaluating our company. If any of these risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nOur business depends upon our ability to sponsor, and raise debt and equity capital for, our investment funds.\nOur business as a specialized asset manager depends upon our ability to sponsor investment funds, raise sufficient equity capital and debt financing for these funds and to generate management fees by managing these funds and the assets they hold. If we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing through these funds, we will not be able to increase our assets under management and, accordingly, increase our revenues from management fees. Moreover, because many of our investment funds have limited terms, an inability to sponsor new investment funds could result in reduced assets under management and, accordingly, reduce our management fee revenues over time. Our ability to raise capital and obtain financing through these funds depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nexisting capital markets conditions which may affect: interest rates, the availability of acquisition financing as well as the amount and cost of such financing, and the returns we are able to achieve on our investments; asset valuation and pricing; and our ability to refinance or exit and realize value from investments made for the funds;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of the types of funds we sponsor and market perceptions about the types of assets which we seek to acquire for our funds;\n\u2022\nthe willingness or ability of investors to invest in long-term, relatively illiquid investments of the type we sponsor;\n\u2022\nthe performance of our existing funds relative to market performance generally and to the performance of similar types of funds;\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified personnel to manage our funds; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable investments on acceptable terms of the type we seek to acquire for our funds.\nThere are few economic barriers to entry in the asset management business.\nOur investment funds compete against an ever-increasing number of investment and asset management products and services sponsored by investment banks, banks, insurance companies, financial services companies and others. There are few economic barriers to entry into the investment or asset management industries and, as a result, we expect that competition for access to distribution channels and appropriate assets to acquire will increase.\nNon-traded companies have been the subject of increased scrutiny by regulators and media outlets resulting from inquires and investigations initiated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and the SEC. These inquiries, and any subsequent inquiries or proceedings could significantly affect our sponsorship and management of non-traded companies and, accordingly, our ability to generate management and related fees.\nA significant portion of our operations consists of the sponsorship and management of non-traded companies, particularly non-traded REITs. Public, non-traded companies have been receiving increased regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and state regulators. Furthermore, amendments to FINRA rules regarding customer account statements have been approved by the SEC and will be effective on April 11, 2016, which may significantly affect the manner in which, and the ability of, non-traded companies to raise capital.\nAs a result of this increased scrutiny and accompanying negative publicity and coverage by media outlets, FINRA may in the future seek to impose additional restrictions on sales practices in the independent broker-dealer channel for non-traded companies and, accordingly, the non-traded companies we are sponsoring now, and non-traded companies we may seek to sponsor in the future, may face increased difficulties in raising capital and commencing operations. Should these companies be unable to raise substantial funds in their offerings, the number and type of investments they may make will be curtailed, all of which could materially reduce the fee income we can generate from these entities as well as our ability to grow our business. If we or the non-\nBack to Index\nBack to Index\ntraded companies we manage become the subject of scrutiny, even if we have complied with all applicable laws and regulations, responding to such scrutiny could be expensive, harmful to our reputation and distracting to our management.\nBecause there are numerous companies seeking to raise capital through non-traded companies, it may be more difficult for us to do so.\nOur ability to sponsor investment funds depends upon our access to various distribution systems of national, regional and local securities firms, and our ability to locate and acquire appropriate assets for our investment funds. We are subject to substantial competition in each area, and in some cases, competition has caused price increases, which has reduced the discount at which many properties sell, making them less attractive from an investment standpoint. In the distribution area, our investment funds compete with those sponsored by other asset managers, which are being distributed through the same networks, as well as investments sponsored by the securities firms themselves; none of the distribution systems which we access has any obligation to sell any of the interests in our investment funds. While we have been successful in maintaining access to these distribution systems, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. If access to one or more of our distribution channels is limited or terminated, the number of funds we sponsor and assets we manage could be reduced, thereby impeding and possibly impairing our revenues and revenue growth.\nIn acquiring appropriate assets for our investment funds, we compete with numerous public and private investment entities, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions, as well as industry participants, in each of our separate asset management areas. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Competition for desirable investments may result in higher costs and lower investment returns, and may reduce our ability to sponsor investment funds.\nMarket changes, including changes in interest rates, may reduce the value of our assets and those of our investment funds\u2019 and our returns on these assets and our ability to generate and increase our management fee revenues.\nMarket changes, including changes in interest rates, will affect the market value of assets we hold for our own account and our returns from such assets. In general, as interest rates rise, the value of fixed-rate investments will decrease, while as interest rates fall, the return on variable rate assets will fall. Changes in interest rates will also affect the value and return on assets we manage for our investment funds, thereby affecting both our management fees from those funds as well as our ability to sponsor additional investment funds, which, in turn, may affect our ability to generate and increase our management fee revenues and achieve growth in our business.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash to fund our participations in our investment funds, our ability to maintain and increase our revenues may be impaired.\nWe typically participate in our investment funds along with our investors, and believe that our participation enhances our ability to raise capital from investors. We typically fund our participations through cash derived from operations or from financing. If our cash from operations is insufficient to fund our participation in future investment funds we sponsor or if we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to participate in our funds, which would impede our ability to raise funds from investors and, thus, our ability to maintain and increase the revenues we receive from fund management.\nTermination of management arrangements with one or more of our investment funds could harm our business.\nWe provide management services to our investment funds through management agreements, through our position as the sole or managing general partner of partnership funds, through our position as the operating manager of other fund entities, or combinations thereof. Our arrangements are long-term, and frequently have no specified termination dates. However, our management arrangements with, or our position as general partner or operating manager of, an investment fund typically may be terminated by action taken by the investors. Upon any such termination, our management fees, after payment of any termination payments required, would cease, thereby reducing our expected future revenues.\nMany of our assets are illiquid, and we may not be able to divest them in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions. In addition, significant portions of our assets are subject to transfer constraints.\nMany of our assets do not have ready markets, or there are restrictions on our ability to divest our investment. As a result, many of our portfolio assets are relatively illiquid investments. We may be unable to vary our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions or to sell our investments on acceptable terms should we desire or need to do so.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures.\nBack to Index\nBack to Index\nWe have and may continue to enter into joint ventures to support growth in our business segments. We may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures, which subject us to risks that may not be present with other methods of investment, including:\n\u2022\nour joint venture partner could become insolvent or bankrupt;\n\u2022\nfraud or misconduct by our joint venture partner;\n\u2022\nshared or, where we are a minority partner, significantly limited decision-making authority which may prevent us from taking actions that would be in our interest or allow our joint venture partner to take actions with which we may disagree;\n\u2022\nconflicts of interest between us and our joint venture partner that could lead to the implementation of policies or objectives that are not in our interest; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to sell or liquidate our investment in the joint venture, or requirements for additional investment, which could reduce our liquidity.\nOccurrence of any of the foregoing could subject us to unanticipated costs (including litigation costs) or reduction or elimination of our expected return or investment.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset management contracts or companies, which entails substantial risk.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset management contracts or companies which subjects us to the risk that, during our due diligence examination of such acquisitions, we may not uncover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers. We may overpay to acquire asset management contracts or companies which could result a return on our investment that is less than anticipated or in losses. We also may not successfully integrate the asset management contracts or companies that we acquire into our business and operations, which could result in substantial costs.\nThe development of new products and services may expose as to additional costs or operational risk.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop, market and manage new investment funds, which may require significant time and resources, as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. Failure to successfully manage these risks may cause our revenues and costs to fluctuate and limit our ability to achieve growth.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may in the future be involved in litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business and may potentially be involved in other legal proceedings, including securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations related to the offering of securities in our investment funds. Even if we successfully defend actions brought against us, the cost, both in terms of fees incurred and the diversion of management time, could be substantial, thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate profitably. Moreover, an adverse result in any legal proceedings could result in our having to pay substantial amounts as fines and/or damages, which could be in excess of our ability to pay and remain a viable business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, may be detrimental to our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has had a significant impact on us and the financial services industry due to increased compliance costs, hedging activities regulation, and broker-dealer compliance. Because much of the Dodd-Frank Act creates a framework through which regulatory reform will be promulgated, rather than providing regulatory reform itself, some of the impacts of the act are not yet fully known.\nFailure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede our productivity and growth.\nOur infrastructure, including our technological capacity and office space, is important to our ability to conduct our operations. Failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business could impede our productivity and growth, which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline.\nFurthermore, we are highly dependent on various software applications, technologies and other systems for our business to function properly and to safeguard confidential information; any significant limitation, failure or security breach of these systems could constrain our operations. We utilize software and related technologies throughout our business to, among other things, obtain asset pricing information, process client transactions, and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage. Although we take protective measures, including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology and established and tested business continuity plans, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war and third-party failures. We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects\nBack to Index\nBack to Index\nthat could result from our failure, or the failure of a third-party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. These adverse effects could include the inability to perform critical business functions or failure to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, which could lead to loss of client confidence, harm to our reputation, exposure to disciplinary action and liability to our clients. Accordingly, potential system failures and the cost necessary to correct those failures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects.\nIn addition, we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. Although we take protective measures, our systems could still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other events that have a security impact, such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently or intentionally causing us to release confidential or proprietary information. Such disclosure could, among other things, allow competitors access to our proprietary business information and require significant time and expense to investigate and remediate the breach. Moreover, loss of confidential client information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues.\nDeclines in the market values of our investments may reduce our earnings and the availability of credit.\nWe classify a portion of our assets for accounting purposes as \u201cavailable-for-sale.\u201d As a result, changes in the market values of those assets are directly charged or credited to stockholders' equity. A decline in these values will reduce the book value of our assets. Moreover, if the decline in value of an available-for-sale asset is other-than-temporary, such decline will reduce earnings. We cannot assure you that there will not be declines in the value of our assets, or that the declines will not be material, or that they will not be other-than-temporary.\nA decline in the market value of our assets may also adversely affect us in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets or seek new borrowings. If the market value of assets securing an existing loan declines, the lender may reduce availability (if the loan is a line of credit), require us to post additional collateral or require us to pay down the loan so that it meets specified loan to collateral value ratios. If we were unable to post the additional collateral, we could have to sell the assets under adverse market conditions which could result in losses and which could result in us failing our debt covenants. Moreover, a decline in asset values could limit our ability to obtain financing in the amounts we seek or require us to provide more collateral to secure proposed financing.\nIncreases in interest rates increase our operating costs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had two corporate credit facilities that were subject to variable interest rates. We may seek to obtain other credit facilities depending upon capital markets conditions. Any facilities that we may be able to obtain may also be at variable rates. To the extent we use these facilities, increases in interest rates will increase our interest costs, which would reduce our net income or cause us to sustain losses.\nOur ability to realize our deferred tax asset may be reduced, which may adversely impact results of operations.\nRealization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences. We may reduce our deferred tax asset in the future if estimates of projected income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset or if there are unanticipated changes in future tax rates. If we determine that a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset is necessary, we may incur a charge to earnings.\nRisks Relating to Particular Aspects of Our Real Estate, Financial Fund Management and Commercial Finance Operations\nThe performance of our investment funds is subject to risks relating to the asset classes in which they invest.\nOur investment funds invest in various classes of assets. They are, accordingly, subject to the risks typically associated with such asset classes, such as, with respect to real estate, the ability to attract tenants, local economic conditions, the availability of mortgage financing, environmental and other regulatory problems, and with respect to loans, economic factors affecting the borrower\u2019s ability to pay debt service. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause one or more investment funds to fail to perform adequately, or at all, which could limit our ability to generate fee income from those funds and our ability to grow through the sponsorship of new investment funds.\nWe typically have retained some portion or all of the equity in the CDOs or CLOs we sponsored. CDO equity receives distributions from the CDO only if the CDO generates enough income to first pay the holders of the debt securities and the CDO's expenses.\nBack to Index\nBack to Index\nWe typically have retained some portion or all of the equity interest in CDOs and CLOs we sponsored either directly or through other entities. The equity is usually entitled to all of the income generated by the CDO or CLO after the CDO or CLO pays all of the interest due on the debt securities and its other expenses, and is entitled to a return on capital only when the principal amount and accrued interest of all of the debt securities has been paid. However, there will be little or no income available to the CDO or CLO equity if covenants regarding the operations of the CDO or CLO (primarily relating to the value of collateral and interest coverage) are not met, or if there are excessive payment defaults, payment deferrals or rating agency downgrades with respect to the issuers of the underlying collateral, and there may be little or no amounts available to return our capital. In that event, our revenues from and the value of our direct or indirect investment in the CDO's or CLO's equity, which for all CDOs and CLOs was $3.6 million at December 31, 2015, could decrease substantially or be eliminated. In addition, the equity securities of CDOs and CLOs are generally illiquid and, because they represent a leveraged investment in the CDO's or CLO's assets, the value of the equity securities will generally have greater fluctuations than the value of the underlying collateral.\nIn some of our investment funds, a portion of our management fees may depend upon the performance of the fund and, as a result, our management fee income may be volatile.\nAs of December 31, 2015, with respect to RSO and nine of our investment entities, we receive incentive or subordinated compensation in addition to our base management fee depending upon whether RSO or those partnerships achieve returns above specified levels. In addition, a portion of our management fees is subordinated to the investors' receipt of specified returns in one of the CLOs we manage. During 2015 and 2014, we earned incentive and subordinated management fees from RSO and from nine and seven CLOs, respectively, which constituted 9% and 9%, respectively, of our aggregate management fee income for both periods. Low growth or recessionary conditions in the national economy may result in the amount of incentive or subordinated management fee income we receive being reduced or possibly eliminated, and may cause these fees to be subject to high volatility.\nOur real estate investment funds hold loans in their portfolios that are subject to a higher risk of loss than conventional mortgage loans.\nThe real estate investment funds that we have sponsored and manage, which we refer to as our RRE Funds, and from which we derive management and other fees, hold loans secured by real estate. In many instances, the loans in their portfolios have terms that differ significantly from conventional mortgage loans. In particular, these loans may:\n\u2022\nbe junior mortgage loans;\n\u2022\ninvolve payment structures other than equal periodic payments that retire a loan over its term;\n\u2022\nrequire the borrower to pay a large lump sum at loan maturity (which will depend upon the borrower's ability to obtain financing or otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash at maturity); and\n\u2022\nbe secured by properties that, while producing income, do not generate sufficient revenues to pay the full amount of debt service on the loan as originally structured.\nAs a result, these real estate loans may have a higher risk of default and loss than conventional mortgage loans, and may require the RRE Funds to become involved in expensive and time-consuming workouts, or bankruptcy, reorganization or foreclosure proceedings.\nBoth the RRE Funds' real estate held and the real estate securing their loans is typically the principal or sole source of recovery for these real estate loans, and thus the value and performance of the RRE Funds will depend upon local, regional and national economic conditions, and conditions affecting the property specifically, including the cost of compliance with, and liability under environmental, health and safety laws, changes in interest rates and the availability of financing, casualty losses, the attractiveness of the property, the availability of tenants, the ability of tenants to pay rent, competition from similar properties in the area and neighborhood values. Operating and other expenses of real properties, particularly significant expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally do not decrease when revenues decrease and, even if revenues increase, operating and other expenses may increase faster than revenues.\nWe may be unable to continue to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and the cost to retain key personnel could put pressure on our operating margin.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, technical, managerial and executive personnel; there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our revenues decline during future periods, it will place significant added pressure on our ability to pay our employees at competitive levels. Our operating margin may decline if we increase compensation to retain key personnel without a commensurate increase in revenues.\nFailure to comply with the Securities Exchange Act, Investment Advisers Act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations.\nBack to Index\nBack to Index\nCertain of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer, are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act or the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act and the Securities Exchange Act impose numerous obligations and duties, respectively, on registered broker-dealers and registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with the requirements of either such act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations, including censure, fines or termination of registration, and could lead to harm to our reputation, any of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline. Moreover, if the registration of our broker-dealer subsidiary was to be terminated for any reason, our ability to sponsor and raise capital for our investment funds could be severely limited, thereby impairing our ability to grow business and fee income.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our business would be subject to applicable restrictions thereunder, which could make it impracticable for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act because the nature of our assets excludes us from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we believe our company is not an investment company pursuant to Rule 3a-1 of the Investment Company Act because we have no more than 45% of our assets invested in and derive no more than 45% of our income from investment securities. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. If we were to be deemed an investment company, however, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as now contemplated.\nRisks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock\nThe percentage of ownership of any of our common stockholders may be diluted if we issue new shares of common stock.\nStockholders have no rights to buy additional shares of stock if we issue new shares of stock. We may issue common stock, convertible debt or preferred stock pursuant to a public offering or a private placement. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Any of our common stockholders who do not participate in any future stock issuances will experience dilution in the percentage of the issued and outstanding stock they own.\nSales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales will occur, may have adverse effects on our share price.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock by us, the sale of shares of common stock held by our current stockholders, and the sale of any shares we may issue under a long-term incentive plan, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nAn increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOne of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our dividend yield, which is our dividend rate as a percentage of our share price, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may desire a higher dividend yield on our common stock or may seek securities paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions are likely to affect the market price of our common stock, and such effects could be significant.\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation, or future issuances of preferred stock, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings. Upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities, other loans and preferred stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before common stockholders. Any preferred stock, if issued, likely will also have a preference on periodic distribution payments, which could eliminate or otherwise limit our ability to make distributions to common stockholders. Common stockholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market prices for our common stock may be volatile.\nBack to Index\nBack to Index\nThe prices at which our common stock may sell in the public market may be volatile. Fluctuations in the market prices of our common stock may not be correlated in a predictable way to our performance or operating results. The prices at which our common stock trade may fluctuate as a result of factors that are beyond our control or unrelated to our performance or operating results.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future or the amount of any dividends.\nOur board of directors will determine the amount and timing of dividends on our common stock. In making this determination, our directors will consider all relevant factors, including, restrictions under Delaware law, capital expenditures and reserve requirements and general operational requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends in the future or in amounts similar to our past distributions. If we do not the market price of our common stock could be reduced.", "PERMNO": 66617, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "REXI"}
