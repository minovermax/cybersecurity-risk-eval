RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock contains a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K, including the matters addressed under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d included under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d above, you should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the events highlighted in the following risks actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe to be material, materialize, our business, results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC and this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes.\nOperational, Strategic, and Reputational Related Risks\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has led to an economic recession and had other adverse effects on the U.S. economy and has disrupted our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely impacted certain industries in which our clients operate and impaired their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain but may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the United States and the world. The spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the U.S. economy at large, and small businesses in particular, and has affected our operations. The responses on the part of the U.S. and global governments and populations have created a recessionary environment, reduced economic activity, and caused significant volatility in the global stock markets. We have experienced significant disruptions across our business due to these effects, which may in future periods lead to decreased earnings, significant loan defaults and slowdowns in our loan collections. We expect increased unemployment and recessionary concerns will adversely affect mortgage originations and loan revenue in future periods. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain but may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a decline in the businesses of certain of our clients, a decrease in consumer confidence, an increase in unemployment, and a disruption in the services provided by our vendors. Continued disruptions to our clients\u2019 businesses could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, the value of loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations, and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. Although the U.S. government introduced, and may introduce in the future, programs designed to soften the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses or provide stimulus checks to individuals, our borrowers may still not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has impacted and likely will continue to impact the financial ability of businesses and consumers to borrow money, which would negatively impact loan volumes. Certain of our borrowers are in, or have exposure to, the retail shopping center, limited service restaurant, hotel, assisted living and nursing home, and residential rental industries and are located in areas that are, or were, quarantined or under stay-at-home orders. COVID-19 may also have an adverse effect on our commercial real estate portfolio, particularly with respect to real estate with exposure to these industries, and our consumer loan portfolios. As COVID-19 cases have begun to surge in recent months, any new or prolonged quarantine or stay-at-home orders would have a negative adverse impact on these borrowers and their revenue streams, which consequently impacts their ability to meet their financial obligations to us and could result in loan defaults.\nThe ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our business will depend on many factors, primarily including the speed and extent of any recovery from the related economic recession. Among other things, this will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in our Wisconsin market, the development, distribution and supply of vaccines, therapies and other public health initiatives to control the spread of the disease, the nature and size of federal economic stimulus and other governmental efforts, and the possibility of additional state lockdown or stay-at-home orders in our markets in response to the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.\nThe initial distribution of vaccines has been slow, and there may continue to be challenges with producing and distributing sufficient quantities of the vaccines. If the general public is unwilling or unable to access effective vaccines and therapies, this may also prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, new variants of COVID-19 may increase the spread or severity of COVID-19 and previously developed vaccines and therapies may not be as effective against new COVID-19 variants.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience adverse financial consequences due to a number of other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreased demand on our liquidity as we meet borrowers\u2019 needs, experience significant credit deterioration, and cover expenses related to our business continuity plan;\n\u2022\nthe potential for reduced liquidity and its negative affect on our capital and leverage ratios;\n\u2022\nthe negative effect on earnings resulting from the Bank modifying loans and agreeing to loan payment deferrals due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe modification of our business practices, including with respect to branch operations, employee travel, employee work locations, participation in meetings, events and conferences, and related changes for our vendors and other business partners;\n\u2022\na decline in demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na potential increase in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures if the economic downturn or high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time;\n\u2022\na potential decline in the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors;\n\u2022\nthe yield on our assets declining to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities as a result of the decline in the Federal Reserve\u2019s target federal funds rate to near 0% (or possibly below 0% in the future);\n\u2022\nuncertainties created by the pandemic, combined with the disruptions to our own business, that could negatively affect our ability to execute our acquisition strategy for the foreseeable future, limiting or delaying our future growth plans;\n\u2022\nincreases in federal and state taxes as a result of the effects of the pandemic and stimulus programs on governmental budgets;\n\u2022\nan increase in FDIC premiums if the agency experiences additional resolution costs relating to bank failures;\n\u2022\nincreased cyber and payment fraud risk due to increased online and remote activity; and\n\u2022\nother operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices because of the pandemic and governmental actions to contain it.\nOverall, we believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 could have a material and adverse impact on our business and result in significant losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would adversely and materially impact our earnings and capital. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nThe U.S. government and banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, have taken a number of unprecedented actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which established a $2.0 trillion economic stimulus package, including cash payments to individuals, supplemental unemployment insurance benefits and a $349.0 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.5 billion in PPP funding. Congress is also in the process of negotiating additional stimulus bills and other actions in response to COVID-19. In addition to implementing the programs contemplated by these acts, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a steady stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nrequiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning;\n\u2022\nadding pandemic scenarios to stress testing;\n\u2022\nencouraging bank use of capital conservation buffers and reserves in lending programs;\n\u2022\npermitting certain regulatory reporting extensions;\n\u2022\nreducing margin requirements on swaps;\n\u2022\npermitting certain otherwise prohibited investments in investment funds;\n\u2022\nissuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and\n\u2022\nproviding credit under the CRA for certain pandemic-related loans, investments, and public service.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and the Federal Reserve has taken a number of actions in response. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve dramatically reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Federal Reserve reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income, our net interest margin and our profitability. The Federal Reserve also launched the Main Street Lending Program, which offers deferred interest on four-year loans to small and mid-sized businesses. The Main Street Lending Program terminated on January 8, 2021. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business activities as a result of new government and regulatory laws, policies, programs, and guidelines, as well as market reactions to such activities, remains uncertain but may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted banking and other financial activities in the areas in which we operate and could potentially create widespread business continuity issues for us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the ability of our employees and clients to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which we operate and could create widespread business continuity issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of an outbreak or escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in our market areas, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have a business continuity plan and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plan and safeguards will be effective. Further, we rely upon third-party vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. If any of these vendors are unable to continue to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our clients or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nThe CARES Act included a $349.0 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals could apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank participates as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposed us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. On April 24, 2020, an additional $310.0 billion in funding for PPP loans was authorized and such funds became available for PPP loans beginning on April 27, 2020. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.5 billion in PPP funding.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by the PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, it has been reported that many borrowers fraudulently obtained PPP loans through the program. We may be subject to regulatory and litigation risk if any of our PPP borrowers used fraudulent means to obtain a PPP loan.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, or if the borrower fraudulently obtained a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate collateral securing our loans.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Under certain circumstances, we may take title to the real property collateral through foreclosure or other means. As the titleholder of the property, we may be responsible for environmental risks, such as hazardous materials, which attach to the property. For these reasons, prior to extending credit, we have an environmental risk assessment program to identify any known environmental risks associated with the real property that will secure our loans. In addition, we routinely inspect properties following the taking of title. When environmental risks are found, environmental laws and regulations may prescribe our approach to remediation. As a result, while we have ownership of a property, we may incur substantial expense and bear potential liability for any damages caused. The environmental risks may also materially reduce the property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the property. We also cannot guarantee that our environmental risk assessment will detect all environmental issues relating to a property, which could subject us to additional liability.\nStrong competition could hurt our earnings and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits, which may reduce our net interest income. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We also face competition for agricultural loans from participants in the nationwide Farm Credit System and much larger regional, national, and global banks. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and the continuing trend of non-bank competition in the financial services industry, such as by fintech companies. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market areas and targeted business segments, our profitability may be negatively affected.\nConsumers and businesses are increasingly using non-banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers and businesses to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, the wide acceptance of internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems and lending platforms in which banks play only minor roles. Customers can maintain funds in prepaid debit cards or digital currencies and pay bills and transfer funds directly without the direct assistance of banks. The diminishing role of banks as financial intermediaries has resulted and could continue to result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the potential loss of lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe have benefited from strong relationships with our customers, and also from our relationships with financial intermediaries. As a result, our reputation is an important component of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to leverage our reputation for customer service and knowledge of our customers\u2019 needs and businesses to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in and outside of our local market areas. We strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. We aim to enhance our reputation, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities and markets we serve, who are able to connect with customers through on-site visits and knowledge of our customers\u2019 businesses, and who care about and deliver superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or by events beyond our control, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties, and inaccurate or incomplete information could subject us to various risks.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with our customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.\nWhile we strive to verify the accuracy and sufficiency of such information, if this information is inaccurate or incomplete, we may be subject to loan losses, regulatory action, reputational harm, or other adverse effects on the operation of our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and on our relationship managers to maintain and grow our agricultural and commercial relationships, and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services and expertise of our founders and the other members of our management team who direct our strategy and operations, especially relating to our agricultural lending focus, and we have benefited from our management\u2019s extensive banking knowledge and experience in this regard. We also rely heavily upon the talents, experience and customer relationships of our loan officers and have benefited from their expertise and relationship-building skills, especially with respect to our agricultural and commercial lending. Members of our executive management team and our seasoned loan officers could be difficult to replace. Our loss of the services of one or more of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering, and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks.\nIn recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potentially fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party partners, such as our online banking, mobile banking, or accounting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain the confidence of our clients. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or the confidential information of our clients, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Our third party partners\u2019 inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms, and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing and mobile and online banking. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. A system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process loans or gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, result in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, failures of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. We also interact with and rely on retailers, for whom we process transactions, as well as financial counterparties and regulators. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and other cyber security breaches described above, and the cyber security measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own and may be inadequate.\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nWe rely on other companies to provide certain key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party service providers provide certain key components of our business infrastructure, such as data processing and deposit processing systems, mobile payment systems, internet connections, and network access. While we have selected these third-party service providers carefully, we do not control their operations. Any failure by these third parties to perform or provide agreed-upon goods and services for any reason or their poor performance of services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third-party service providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWe may continue to attempt to expand our business in Wisconsin or other states through mergers and acquisitions. We anticipate that we will seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\nunexpected delays, complications or expenses resulting from regulatory approval requirements or other conditions to closing;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we lack experience; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers.\nWith respect to the risks particularly associated with the integration of an acquired business, we may encounter a number of difficulties, such as: (1) customer loss and revenue loss; (2) the loss of key employees; (3) the disruption of our operations and business; (4) our inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; (5) possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; and/or (6) unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology, and credit.\nIn addition to the risks posed by the integration process itself, the focus of management\u2019s attention and effort on integration may result in a lack of sufficient management attention to other important issues, causing harm to our business. Also, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of an acquired business. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to successfully keep pace with technological change, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry generally, and virtual banking in particular, could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to specific market risks due to our focus on agricultural lending.\nWe primarily concentrate our lending activities in the state of Wisconsin, which has a significant agricultural economy. Historically, our senior management\u2019s primary business lending experience has been in agricultural lending, with a specific expertise in and focus on dairy and dairy-related businesses. Although we attempt to maintain a diversified customer base and a diversified loan portfolio, we are more heavily dependent upon the agricultural economy than a typical commercial bank. At December 31, 2020, agricultural loans comprised $606.9 million, or approximately 60.9%, of our total loan portfolio, and the Bank also serviced an additional $812.6 million of agricultural and commercial loans, which generated approximately $10.3 million of servicing fee income during 2020.\nThe agricultural economy is subject to certain risks that are either inherently volatile or are beyond our ability, or the ability of farmers or other participants in the agricultural economy, to predict or control. Some of these risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nMarket Prices. Agricultural markets are sensitive to real and perceived changes in supply and demand of agricultural products, and given that approximately 85% of our agricultural lending is to dairy farms, the credit quality of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is closely related to the performance of, and supply and demand in, this sub-sector of the agricultural market. For example, the success of a dairy operation hinges in large part on the cost of feed and the price of milk. When feed costs are high and milk prices are low, it places a strain on our dairy borrowers\u2019 business, which may impair their ability to repay their outstanding loans to us.\n\u2022\nGovernmental Policies and Regulations. Our agricultural loans are dependent on the profitable operation and management of the farm properties securing the loans and their cash flows, and government policies and regulations (including the availability of price supports for crops and other agricultural products (in particular, milk), subsidies, tariffs, trade agreements, or government-sponsored crop insurance) are outside the control of our borrowers and may affect the successful operation of a farm.\n\u2022\nChanging Consumer Preferences. The business of dairy farms and dairy-related borrowers is subject to changing consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns. Periodically, medical and other studies are released which raise concerns over the healthfulness of cow\u2019s milk in the human diet. As a result of studies or other cultural influences, the dairy industry could be affected by certain consumer concerns about dairy products, such as the fat, cholesterol, calorie, sodium and lactose content of such products, which could reduce demand for dairy products and negatively affect dairy-related revenue. In addition, the introduction and rising popularity of dairy-free alternatives to milk, such as almond, soy and oat beverages, could reduce the demand for dairy products and thereby reduce revenues for dairy farmers.\n\u2022\nWeather-Related Risks. Severe weather, including drought, hail, excessive rain or other natural disasters, could impact the quantity and quality of crops and of feed necessary to support our borrowers\u2019 dairy operations and, in turn, increase their expenses. If significant adverse weather-related events occur, it could impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or impair the value of collateral securing loans due to significant property damage, which could either result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.\n\u2022\nDisease-Related Risks. The operations of our dairy farm and dairy-related borrowers depend primarily on their cattle. If the livestock were to contract an illness or disease, the borrowers would incur additional expenses, and the viability of their operations may be compromised if the disease is not properly managed. The existence of a widespread livestock disease or pandemic could have a significant impact on our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay outstanding loans or impair the value of collateral securing loans, which could either result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.\n\u2022\nReal Property Value. Our dairy farm and dairy-related borrowers tend to grow and produce much of their feed as opposed to purchasing it from third parties, unlike many dairy farmers in other parts of the country. While this means they are often less subject to fluctuations in feed prices, they require more land. Accordingly, declines in real property values in the areas in which we operate could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers or an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, default and charge-offs, and could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on agricultural loans.\nOur focus on local markets and agricultural lending creates credit concentration risks.\nCredit risk is primarily related to the risk that a borrower will not be able to repay some or all of its obligations to us. Concentrations of credit risk occur when the aggregate amount owed by one borrower, a group of related borrowers, or borrowers within the same or related markets, industries or groups, represents a relatively large percentage of the total capital or total credit extended by a bank. Although each loan in a concentration may be of sound quality, concentration risks represent a risk not present when the same loan amounts are extended to a more diversified group of borrowers. Loans concentrated in one borrower depend, to a large degree, upon the financial capability and character of the individual borrower. Loans made to a group of related borrowers can be susceptible to financial problems experienced by one or a few members of that group. Loans made to borrowers that are part of the same or related industries or groups, or that are located in the same market area, can all be adversely impacted with respect to their ability to repay some or all of their obligations when adverse conditions prevail in the broader economy generally, in the market specifically or even within just the respective industries or groups.\nOur lending is primarily to borrowers located or doing business in Wisconsin. Furthermore, at December 31, 2020, we had certain loan-type concentrations of credit risk, specifically in agricultural lending, which are described in more detail in the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cItem 1 - Business-Lending Activities\u201d and \u201cItem 1 - Business-General-Market.\u201d Because of the concentration of agricultural loans in our lending portfolio and the volume of our borrowers in regions dependent upon agriculture, we could be disproportionately affected by changes in the agricultural industry relative to others because these high concentrations present a risk to our lending operations. If any of these borrowers becomes unable to repay their loan obligations for any reason, our nonperforming loans, our allowance for loan losses, and our provision for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA prolonged period of weakness in the agricultural economy could result in an increase in agricultural defaults and impaired assets.\nA prolonged period of weakness in the agricultural economy could result in a decrease in demand for loans or other products and services offered by us, an increase in agricultural loan delinquencies and defaults, an increase in impaired assets and foreclosures, a decline in the value of our loans secured by real estate, and an inability to sell foreclosed assets. The effects of a prolonged period of a weakened agricultural economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on local economies, and a regional or local economic downturn affecting Wisconsin may magnify the adverse effects and consequences to us.\nWe operate as a community-oriented business bank, with a focus on servicing both business customers and individuals in our market areas, which include our headquarters in Manitowoc, full-service branches in Manitowoc, Appleton, Green Bay, and Stevens Point, and a loan production office in each of Darlington, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, and Sheboygan. Although we have a primary focus on agricultural and business banking, future growth opportunities will depend largely on market area penetration, market area growth and our ability to compete for traditional banking business within our market areas. We anticipate that as a result of this concentration, a downturn in the general economy in our market areas, including Wisconsin specifically, could increase the risk of loss associated with our loan portfolio. Although economic conditions in our markets have been generally strong, there can be no assurance that such conditions will continue to prevail. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic, growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of, or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; uncertainty in U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs; natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; widespread disease or pandemics; or a combination of these or other factors.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 60.9% of our total loan portfolio was comprised of agricultural loans. Volatility in certain commodity prices, including milk, could adversely impact the ability of those borrowers to perform under the terms of their borrowing arrangements with us. In terms of the dairy industry, milk prices have fluctuated. For the 18-year period ended December 31, 2020, the per-year average Class III milk price (a weighted average price of all uses of milk in a particular milk order) in the United States paid to producers has ranged from an average low price of $11.36 per hundredweight (cwt) in 2009 to an average high price of $22.34 per cwt in 2014, according to the University of Wisconsin - Madison. During 2020, the Class III milk price was an average of $18.16 per cwt. \u201cHundredweight\u201d or \u201ccwt\u201d is a measure equal to 100 pounds of milk shipped. A decrease in milk prices may result in an increase in the number of non-performing loans in our agricultural portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings, and capital.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there have been changes in U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, and retaliatory tariffs by such countries, including retaliatory tariffs on agricultural products from the United States. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export, including among others, agricultural products and dairy products, could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer\u2019s margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets where we operate, as a large portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 57.6% of our aggregate loan portfolio, comprising our agriculture real estate loans (including agricultural construction loans), commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans, was primarily secured by interests in real estate predominantly located in Wisconsin and southeast Minnesota. Additionally, some of our other lending occasionally involves taking real estate as primary or secondary collateral. Real property values in Wisconsin may be different from, and in some instances worse than, real property values in other markets or in the United States as a whole, and may be affected by a variety of factors outside our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions generally. The market value of real estate securing our real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Although a significant portion of such loans is secured by real estate as a secondary form of repayment, adverse developments affecting real estate values in Wisconsin could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio and cause an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nIf problems develop in the real estate market, particularly within Wisconsin, the value of collateral securing our real estate loans could decline. In such case, we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and/or capital.\nOur commercial real estate and commercial loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate, and our credit risk may increase if we succeed in our plan to increase our commercial lending.\nAt December 31, 2020, $331.7 million, or approximately 35.2%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial loans. Given their generally larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate. For commercial real estate loans, the principal risk is that repayment is generally dependent on income from tenant leases being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. For commercial loans, the principal risk is that repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. If loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk.\nThe operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, and risks relating to the value of collateral. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our bankers follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses totaled $14.8 million, which represented 1.5% of gross loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, and could decrease our net income or reduce our capital.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to charge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, beginning in January 2023, the Company will be required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which will change how the Company calculates its allowance for loan losses by requiring the Company to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results on operations.\nMonetary Policy and Interest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our earnings and asset value.\nLike other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and securities) and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings). Changes in both the general level of interest rates and in the difference between short-term and long-term rates can affect our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWhile we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, including by seeking to originate variable rate loans and balancing the respective terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates may still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and liabilities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which could affect our earnings.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The specific effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nInterest rates on our financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely impact our revenue, expenses, and value of those financial instruments.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority regulating LIBOR, along with various other regulatory bodies, announced that LIBOR would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021. LIBOR makes up the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments. We have exposure to LIBOR in various aspects through our financial contracts. Instruments that may be impacted include loans, securities, derivatives, and subordinated debentures, among other financial contracts indexed to LIBOR and that mature after December 31, 2021.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, started in May 2018 to publish the SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associate with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, subordinated debentures and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022\nprompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022\nresult in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language, or lack of fallback language, in LIBOR-based instruments; and\n\u2022\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nIf a significant portion of any future unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities were to become other than temporarily impaired with credit losses, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings, and our capital ratios would be adversely impacted.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of those securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other than temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in future periods and result in realized losses.\nWe analyze our investment securities quarterly to determine whether, in the opinion of management, any of the securities have OTTI. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities is determined to have OTTI and is credit-loss related, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made, and our capital ratios will be adversely impacted. Generally, a fixed income security is determined to have OTTI when it appears unlikely that we will receive all of the principal and interest due in accordance with the original terms of the investment. In addition to credit losses, losses are recognized for a security with an unrealized loss if the Company has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before collection of the principal amount.\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nLimits on our ability to use brokered deposits as part of our funding strategy may adversely affect our ability to grow.\nA \u201cbrokered deposit\u201d is any deposit that is obtained from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker, which includes larger correspondent banks and securities brokerage firms. These deposit brokers attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the country and internationally whose deposit decisions are based almost exclusively on obtaining the highest interest rates. We have used brokered deposits in the past, and we intend to continue to use brokered deposits as one of our funding sources to support future growth. At December 31, 2020, brokered deposits represented approximately 7.7% of our total deposits and equaled $80.5 million. There are risks associated with using brokered deposits. In order to continue to maintain our level of brokered deposits, we may be forced to pay higher interest rates than contemplated by our asset-liability pricing strategy. In addition, banks that become less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under applicable regulatory capital requirements may be restricted in their ability to accept or prohibited from accepting brokered deposits. In addition, banks not considered to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d are subject to a cap on interest rates paid to depositors as published by the FDIC. Such depositor interest rate caps could impede our ability to raise local deposits to replace brokered deposits no longer available if we were not considered to be \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d If brokered deposits become more difficult to access, we will have to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue to fund our growth. This may include increasing our reliance on the FHLB borrowings, attempting to attract non-brokered deposits, reducing our available for sale securities portfolio and selling loans, potentially at a time when pricing may be unfavorable, which may increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income and net income. There can be no assurance that brokered deposits will be available or, if available, sufficient to support our continued growth.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations, including financial commitments, as they come due and is inherent in our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and/or investment securities and from other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of our customer deposits, which we supplement with other sources such as brokered deposits. Deposit balances can decrease for a variety of reasons, including when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds. This loss would require us to seek other funding alternatives, including brokered deposits, in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. There is also the potential risk that collateral calls with respect to our repurchase agreements could reduce our available liquidity.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our business plan, including originating loans, investing in securities, meeting our expenses, or fulfilling obligations such as repaying our borrowings and meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by our regulators and the Basel III Rule to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We believe our current levels of capital is sufficient to permit us to maintain regulatory capital compliance for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or to address losses.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our operations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital if required by the Federal Reserve, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\nLegal, Accounting, and Compliance Risks\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected and any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, monitoring and reporting requirements. There may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified, or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision, and examination. A more detailed description of the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us is contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K in the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers, and the banking system as a whole, rather than our shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and undergo periodic examinations by our regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies and to impose additional restrictions on the activities of bank and bank holding companies. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, additional restrictions on our activities, and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. These regulations may be impacted by the political ideologies of the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government as well as the heads of regulatory and administrative agencies, which may change as a result of elections.\nCurrent or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including our ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\nThe Basel III Rule imposes stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies and banks. Banks and bank holding companies are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital on top of minimum risk-weighted asset ratios to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction. Banking institutions that do not maintain capital in excess of the Basel III Rule standards including the capital conservation buffer face constraints on the payment of dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Accordingly, if the Bank fails to maintain the applicable minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, distributions to the Company may be prohibited or limited.\nFuture increases in minimum capital requirements could adversely affect our net income. Furthermore, our failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement actions under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including future acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies may negatively affect our performance.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements, such as the implementation of CECL. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, which could have a negative impact on our reported results.\nThe CECL accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, amount of capital and results of operations.\nThe FASB has adopted a new accounting standard that is effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as CECL, makes significant changes to the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments presented on an amortized cost basis, such as our loans held for investment, and disclosures about them. The new CECL impairment model will require an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, which considers reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. The standard provides significant flexibility and requires a high degree of judgment with regards to pooling financial assets with similar risk characteristics and adjusting the relevant historical loss information in order to develop an estimate of expected lifetime losses. Providing for losses over the life of our loan portfolio is a change to the previous method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable and incurred. This change may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses rapidly in future periods, and greatly increases the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. It may also result in even small changes to future forecasts having a significant impact on the allowance, which could make the allowance more volatile, and regulators may impose additional capital buffers to absorb this volatility.\nWe are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities that may be costly and time-consuming and may require expensive remedial action or other costs.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and the Bank are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments that both entities have made and the businesses in which they have engaged. Federal and state taxing authorities have over the past few years become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property, and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment, and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If not resolved in our favor, such challenges could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA prolonged U.S. government shutdown or default by the U.S. on government obligations would harm our results of operations.\nOur results of operations, including interest and dividend income, non-interest income, interest expenses, and net interest income, would be adversely affected in the event of widespread financial and business disruption on account of a default by the United States on U.S. government obligations or a prolonged failure to maintain significant U.S. government operations. Of particular impact to the Company are the operations pertaining to the SBA, the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the FDIC. Any such failure to maintain such U.S. government operations, and the after-effects of such shutdown, could impede our ability to originate SBA or FSA loans and our ability to sell such loans in the secondary market, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our investment securities are issued by and some of our loans are made to the U.S. government and government agencies and sponsored entities. Uncertain domestic political conditions, including prior federal government shutdowns and potential future federal government shutdowns or other unresolved political issues, may pose credit default and liquidity risks with respect to investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government and loans to the federal government. Any downgrade in the sovereign credit rating of the United States, as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries, could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. Any such adverse impact could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the Bank\u2019s performance.\nThe Company\u2019s only source of funds to pay dividends is dividends or other distributions it may receive directly from the Bank. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. The inability of the Company to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends. The Company\u2019s payment of dividends in the future, if any, will also be subject to legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions (including with respect to junior subordinated debentures (and related trust preferred securities (\u201cTruPS\u201d)), which are senior to our shares of preferred and common stock and have a preference on dividends and with respect to our subordinated notes, which restrict the payment of dividends upon an event of default under the notes), and will also depend on the Bank\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors. Dividends are payable on shares at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, and any regulatory restrictions.\nOur stock is relatively thinly traded.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, the average daily trading volume of our common stock is relatively low compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given time. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall more than would be justified by the inherent worth of the Company. Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant amount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically, as a result of which shareholders might not have been able to sell or purchase the Company\u2019s common stock at the volume, price, or time desired. In June 2020, the Company\u2019s common stock was added to the Russell 2000\u00ae and Russell 3000\u00ae Indexes based on the total market value of shares outstanding. Inclusion in these indexes may have positively impacted the price, trading volume, and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock, in part, because holders attempting to track the composition of that index may have been required to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock, which could cause a material increase in the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock trades. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s common stock will remain in those indexes. If the Company\u2019s common stock is removed from the Russell 2000\u00ae or the Russell 3000\u00ae Index in the future, index funds, institutional investors, or other holders attempting to track the composition of that index may be required to sell the Company\u2019s common stock, which could impact the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock trades.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nIn January 2020, the Company\u2019s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 673,000 shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. As of December 31, 2020, 570,842 shares of our common stock had been acquired through the repurchase program.\nIn February 2021, the Company\u2019s board of directors extended the stock repurchase program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase an additional 609,000 shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock, and there is no assurance that the Company will do so or that the Company will repurchase shares at favorable prices. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, the program may not enhance long-term shareholder value.", "PERMNO": 15180, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ICBK"}
