Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of the following risks, many of which are beyond our control, could\nmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. While we believe that the following list identifies our most significant risk factors, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. For more information, see \u201cCautionary Statement\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWORLDWIDE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO DECREASE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nWorldwide economic and industry conditions may adversely affect our business. Our revenue is primarily dependent upon demand from semiconductor manufacturers, which is largely driven by the current and anticipated business and consumer demand for electronic products that utilize semiconductors. Despite the broadening of semiconductor demand drivers to including applications such as smartphones, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, amongst others, the semiconductor industry has historically been, and may in the future be, highly cyclical with periodic significant downturns, resulting in significantly decreased expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers. We are unable to predict the ultimate duration or severity of any future downturns for the semiconductor industry. We have in the past experienced significant revenue deterioration and operating losses due to a severe downturn in the semiconductor industry. During downturns, our revenue is reduced and there is likely to be an increase in pricing pressure and shifts in product and customer mix, all of which may affect gross margin and net income. Additionally, the semiconductor industry is affected by seasonal shifts in demand. Even moderate cyclicality or seasonality can cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from one period to the next.\nUncertain and volatile economic conditions and other factors can exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending, causing our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing our products and solutions, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in order patterns have an immediate impact on our revenues because we typically do not have significant backlog. Uncertain economic and industry conditions make it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize business risks. If we do not appropriately respond to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. We may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities. Furthermore, since we must continue to maintain a satisfactory level of engineering, research and development expenditures, continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain the ability to respond to any significant increases in demand, if they occur, lower sales volume in periods of reduced demand can have a large impact on our profitability.\nOUR DEPENDENCE ON SINGLE AND LIMITED SOURCE SUPPLIERS OR AN INTERRUPTION IN OUR ORDINARY SOURCES OF SUPPLY COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe rely on single or limited source suppliers for raw materials, such as plastic polymers, filtration membranes, petroleum coke and other materials, which are critical to the manufacturing of our products. If we lost one of these sources, it may be difficult for us to find an alternative supplier and we would need to qualify this new source through our customers\u2019 rigorous qualification processes. Although we seek to reduce dependence on these sole and limited source suppliers, the partial or complete loss of these sources could interrupt our manufacturing operations and result in an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAt times, we have experienced a limited supply of certain raw materials and have had to substitute raw materials, which have resulted in delays, increased costs and risks associated with qualifying products made from such new raw materials with our customers. Events such as an industry-wide increase in demand for, or the discontinuation of, raw materials used in our products could affect our ability to acquire sufficient quantities and our manufacturing operations may be interrupted. For example, global demand for fluoropolymers increased unexpectedly in 2017 due to greater requirements from certain markets. While we were able to maintain our supply of this raw material and prevent delays in customer shipments by holding forecast reviews with our key suppliers and securing higher levels of fluoropolymers inventory, future raw materials shortages may adversely affect our operations. Additionally, our suppliers may not have the capacity to meet increases in our demand for raw materials, in turn, making it difficult for us to meet demand from our customers. Furthermore, prices for our raw materials can vary widely. While we have long-term arrangements with certain key suppliers that fix our price for the purchase of certain raw materials, if the cost of our raw materials increases and we are unable to correspondingly increase the sales price of our products or find other cost savings, our profit margins will decline.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISKS OF OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\nSales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 78%, 79% and 78% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales. In addition, a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets. We also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the United States and are dependent on international suppliers for many of our parts and raw materials. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated government actions, laws, rules, regulations and policies, such as \u201ctrade wars\u201d or changes in international trade requirements and sanctions and/or tariffs that affect our business and that of our customers and suppliers, that could impose additional costs on our operations, or that could limit our ability to operate our business;\n\u2022\nchallenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries;\n\u2022\nmanagement of a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, along with differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and compliance with legal, environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;\n\u2022\nfluctuating pricing and availability of raw materials and supply chain interruptions;\n\u2022\nexpense and complexity of complying with U.S. and foreign import and export regulations, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currency including Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Korean won, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar, which could cause our sales and profitability to decline;\n\u2022\nliability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations;\n\u2022\ncustomer or government efforts to encourage operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China or that favor domestic companies over nondomestic companies, including efforts to provide for the development and growth of local competitors; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and uncertainty.\nIn the past, we have incurred costs or experienced disruptions due to the factors described above and we expect to do so in the future. For example, effective October 30, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce restricted exports to a Chinese semiconductor manufacturing company and may in the future impose further restrictions on this or other semiconductor manufacturers or industry participants. While this particular event is not expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue, other restrictions could impact our ability to serve customers in China and in other countries. In addition, the import of gas canisters and chemicals viewed as dangerous have come under increased regulatory scrutiny by governmental officials in China. As a result, we have established partnerships with local suppliers. However, this increased regulation may impair the ability of our SCEM segment to import those products into China and may cause us to lose sales. Also, in the past, our operations in Asia, and particularly South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, have been negatively impacted as a result of regional economic instability. There have historically been strained relations between China and Taiwan and there are continuing tensions between North Korea and other countries, including South Korea and the United States. Any adverse developments in those relations could significantly disrupt the worldwide production of semiconductors, which may lead to reduced sales of our products.\nA SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES IS CONCENTRATED ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY MAY MATERIALLY DECLINE IF WE LOST ONE OR MORE OF THESE CUSTOMERS.\nSales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. Our top ten customers accounted for 44%, 47% and 45% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our customers could stop using our products in their manufacturing processes with limited advance notice to us and suffer little or no penalty for doing so. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by even a single customer could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, if our products are not specified for these customers\u2019 products or production processes, or if we suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Due to the long design and development cycle and lengthy customer product qualification periods required for most of our new products, we may be unable to quickly replace these customers, if at all.\nFurthermore, the semiconductor industry has been undergoing, and is expected to continue to undergo, consolidation. If any of our customers merge or are acquired, we may experience lower overall sales from the merged or surviving companies. In addition, our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power and may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us, and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others.\nWe could also lose our key customers or significant sales to our key customers because of factors beyond our control, such as a significant disruption in our customers\u2019 businesses generally or in a specific product line, a change in the manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments. For example, our customers\u2019 aggressive management of inventory has adversely affected revenue in our SCEM segment in the past and may adversely affect future results of operations.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE BY CONTINUING TO INNOVATE AND INTRODUCE NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions. As a result, the life cycle of our products is difficult to determine. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop mission-critical solutions to maximize our customers\u2019 manufacturing yields and enable higher performance of end-market materials or devices. This requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner. A failure to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products or the inability to timely manufacture and ship these products or enhancements in sufficient volume could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales. In addition, if new products have reliability or quality problems, we may experience reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment, additional service and warranty expense, and damage to our reputation.\nCOMPETITION FROM NEW OR EXISTING COMPANIES COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have better-established customer relationships than we do, which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently and more quickly by these customers. We also face competition from smaller, regional companies, which focus on serving those customers in their same region. Another source of competition is from the manufacturing engineering teams of our customers, who continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we expect that existing and new competitors will improve the design of their existing products and will introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. The introduction of new products or more efficient production of existing products by our competitors could diminish our market share and increase pricing pressure on our products.\nIF OUR NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES AND RELATED INVESTMENTS DO NOT RESULT IN FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY MAY DECLINE.\nIn the semiconductor market, while the development period for a product can be very long, the first company to introduce an innovative product meeting an identified customer need will often have a significant advantage over offerings of competitive products. For this reason, we may make significant cash expenditures to research, develop, engineer and market new products and make significant capital investments in technology and manufacturing capacity in advance of future business developing and without any purchase commitment from our customers. For example, to support new product and technology development, we incurred $118.5 million, $107.0 million and $107.0 million for engineering, research and development expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFollowing development, it may take a number of years for sales of a new product to reach a substantial level, if ever. A product concept may never progress beyond the development stage or may only achieve limited acceptance in the marketplace. If this occurs, we do not receive a direct return on our expenditures, we may not realize any indirect benefits, we may lose market share and our revenue and profitability may decline. For example, from 2011 to 2014, our capital expenditures relating to developing the capability to manufacture shippers and FOUPs for 450 mm wafers were approximately $16.5 million. However, major semiconductor manufacturers have announced that they would not initiate 450 mm manufacturing in the foreseeable future. As a result, we incurred significant impairment charges in fiscal year 2017. We cannot assure you that the new products and technology we choose to develop and market in the ordinary course of our business will be successful.\nTARIFFS, TRADE RESTRICTIONS AND PROTECTIONIST MEASURES RESULTING FROM INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.\nWe have significant sales to customers outside of the United States and we purchase a significant amount of raw materials from suppliers outside of the United States. The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. While there is uncertainty as to the duration of these tariffs and scope of future tariffs, tariffs may increase the costs of certain raw materials that we import into the United States and may negatively impact our margins as we may not be able to increase the prices of our products. Retaliatory tariffs on goods manufactured in the United Stated could make the products we sell from the United States more expensive to customers outside the United States, reducing the competitiveness of our products, harming sales and inhibiting our ability to do business in these foreign countries. As a result of these ongoing trade disputes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be negatively impacted.\nWE MAY ACQUIRE OTHER BUSINESSES, FORM JOINT VENTURES OR DIVEST BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.\nAs part of our business strategy, and as we have done in the past, we expect to address gaps in our product offerings, adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our ongoing strategic objectives, diversify into complementary markets and increase our scale through acquisitions, joint ventures or other types of collaborations, including the Proposed Merger. As a result, we may enter markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and may encounter difficulties in divesting businesses that no longer meet our objectives. Competition for acquiring attractive businesses in our industry is substantial. We may experience difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or in completing selected transactions at appropriate valuations, in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction. In addition, new legislation or regulations may increase the difficulty or impair our ability to invest or consummate transactions in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. Specifically, the Proposed Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including the receipt of approvals from our and Versum\u2019s shareholders, the receipt of approvals under U.S. and certain foreign antitrust and competition laws, and other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and there can be no assurance that the Proposed Merger will be completed.\nAlternatively, we may be required to undertake multiple transactions at the same time in order to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that do arise. This could strain our ability to effectively execute and integrate these transactions. In addition, the integration of certain operations following a transaction, including the Proposed Merger, requires the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during integration process may also disrupt our business. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we do make into our existing business operations, including the Proposed Merger. For example, if we fail to successfully integrate and operate the gas purification business we acquired from SAES Getters S.p.A. in June 2018, we may not meet our revenue and bottom line objectives for the MC division or for the Company, and if we fail to successfully integrate the operations of Versum, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of the Proposed Merger. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which may affect the value of the shares of our common stock after the completion of the Proposed Merger. Additionally, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and/or from future potential impairment of acquired assets, including goodwill, related to future acquisitions. For example, despite our due diligence review, an acquired company may have inadequate or ineffective an internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices. We may experience difficulties in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business, and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from other business issues.\nMANUFACTURING INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS, FAILURE TO RESPOND TO SHIFTS IN DEMAND, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE AND MANUFACTURE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur manufacturing processes are complex and require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials. These processes are frequently modified to improve manufacturing yields and product quality. We have, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties, such as occasional critical equipment breakdowns or the introduction of impurities in the manufacturing process, which could cause lower manufacturing yields, make our products unmarketable and/or delay deliveries to customers. In addition, modification to the manufacturing process of our products may require that the affected product be re-qualified by our customers, which can increase our costs and delay our ability to sell this product to our customers. These and other manufacturing difficulties may result in the loss of sales and exposure to warranty and product liability claims.\nA number of our product lines are manufactured at only one or two facilities in different countries. A disruption at these facilities could impact our sales until another facility could commence or expand production of such products. We have in the past moved, and we may in the future move, the manufacture of certain product lines from one of our plants to another, usually to enhance efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing operations and to better serve customers located in various countries. If we fail to efficiently and effectively transfer and re-establish the manufacturing processes in the destination plant, we may not be able to meet customer order, we may lose credibility with our customers and our business may be harmed. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, there is no assurance that we will achieve anticipated cost savings and efficiencies.\nOur ability to increase sales of our products, particularly our capital equipment products, depends in part upon our ability to timely ramp up our manufacturing capacity for such products, often in as little as a few months, and to quickly mobilize our supply chain. If we are unable to accurately foresee or anticipate rapid shifts in demand, expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, manage such expansion effectively and obtain an increase in required raw materials from our supply chain, our customers could seek such products from our competitors, and our market share could be reduced. Additionally, we typically operate our business on a just-in-time shipment basis with a modest level of backlog, ordering supplies and planning production based on internal demand forecasts. The failure to accurately forecast demand for our products, in terms of both volume and product type, has in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments, disappointment of customer expectations, and, alternatively, an increased risk of excess and obsolescence of our inventory. If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations involve, and we are exposed to the risks associated with, the use and the manufacture of hazardous materials, in particular, specialty chemical manufacturing, and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and waste in our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer. For example, while we believe that our SDS and VAC delivery systems are the safest available in the industry, as with any products involved in the transport, storage and delivery of toxic gases, if a leak were to occur during transport, during storage or during delivery at our customers\u2019 location, serious damage could result including injury or death to any person exposed to those toxic gases creating significant product liability for us. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to satisfy any such liabilities and our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nLOSS OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, WHILE OUR INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN NEW QUALIFIED PERSONNEL COULD INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS SUCCESSFULLY.\nMany of our key personnel have significant experience in the semiconductor industry and deep technical expertise. The loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, specifically research and development and engineering personnel, could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully. As the semiconductor industry has experienced growth in recent years, the competition between industry participants for qualified talent, particularly those with significant experience in the semiconductor industry, has intensified. As a result, the difficulty and costs associated with attracting and retaining key employees has risen and may rise further in the future rise.\nIF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN, PROTECT AND ENFORCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS COULD BE HARMED.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights. We rely on patent, trade secret and trademark law to protect many of our major product platforms. We have obtained a number of patents relating to our products and solution. While we have filed applications for additional patents, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will be approved, that we will develop additional patentable proprietary technology, that any patents owned by or issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that these patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised by third parties. In addition, if we do not obtain intellectual property protection in the international jurisdictions we serve, our competitiveness in these markets could be significantly impaired, which could limit our growth and future revenue. While we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with third parties to protect our proprietary information and technology, these agreements may be breached by such employees or third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Furthermore, our confidential and proprietary information and technology could be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties and third parties could design around our patents.\nCompetitors may misappropriate our intellectual property rights, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property rights may arise. We may institute litigation in order to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of\ninfringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights. For example, in January 2011, we settled multiple patent litigations with Pall Corporation (which was acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2015). We prosecuted and defended these cases vigorously and incurred substantial costs in pursuing them. It may become necessary for us to initiate other costly patent litigation against our competitors in order to protect and/or perfect our intellectual property rights. We cannot predict how any existing or future litigation will be resolved or what its impact will be on us.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties. If we are found to infringe or misappropriate a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights, we could be required to pay damages to such third party, alter our products or processes, obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights, including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights. If we are required to obtain a license from a third party, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms or at all.\nOUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE OR NATURAL CATASTROPHES IN THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH WE, OUR CUSTOMERS OR OUR SUPPLIERS OPERATE, SUCH AS THE MARCH 2011 EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN, HURRICANE HARVEY IN EAST TEXAS, HURRICANE IRMA IN FLORIDA IN 2017 AND THE WILDFIRES IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO AND CALIFORNIA IN 2012, 2017 AND 2018.\nWe have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to severe weather and natural catastrophes which could disrupt operations, such as typhoons in Taiwan and China, earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan in 2011, hurricanes in east Texas (Hurricane Harvey) and in Florida (Hurricane Irma), each in 2017, and wildfires in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2012 and in California in 2017 and 2018. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Also, climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. While our business continuity plans enabled us to mitigate the impact to our operations of the events described above, there can be no assurance that such plans will be effective in the future or that such catastrophes will not disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK DISRUPTIONS AND BREACHES IN DATA SECURITY, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our financial information, intellectual property, confidential information, proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security from cyber-attacks, employee error or social media use on our computers, through failure of our internet service providers and other cloud computing service providers to successfully secure their own systems or from other causes could disrupt our operations, cause customer communication and order management issues, cause the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee and proprietary information, cause disruption in our transaction processing or lead to issues with maintaining our controls over our financial reporting, which could affect our reputation and reporting of financial results.\nAll information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. While our management has implemented network security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control, emergency recovery processes and internal control measures, we have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not occur and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows.\nRelatedly, new laws and regulations, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016 that became effective May 2018, add to the complexity of our compliance obligations, which may increase compliance costs, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.\nFailure to comply with the wide variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulatory requirements relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation, of, and human exposure to, hazardous chemicals, which\nhave tended to become stricter over time, could result in future liabilities or the suspension of production or shipment. For example, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act modified the Toxic Control Substances Act, or TSCA, by requiring the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, to prioritize and evaluate the environmental and health risks of existing chemicals and provides EPA with greater authority to regulate chemicals posing unreasonable risks. According to this statute, the EPA is required to make an affirmative finding that a new chemical will not pose an unreasonable risk before such chemical can go into production. As a result, TSCA has been updated so that it operates in a similar fashion to the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals, or REACH, legislation in Europe. Regulations similar to REACH have been enacted in South Korea and Taiwan. These laws and regulations, among others, increase the complexity and costs of transporting our products from the country in which they are manufactured, to the location of our customer. Any further changes to these and similar regulations in the countries in which we operate or sell into could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or to build or acquire new facilities, require us to acquire costly control equipment, cause us to incur expenses associated with remediation of contamination, modify our manufacture or shipping processes, or otherwise increase our cost of doing business and have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to risk of liability for environmental contamination if hazardous materials are released into the environment, which could result in substantial losses, reputational harm, increase in our insurance cost or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.\nCHANGES IN TAXATION OR ADVERSE TAX RULINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe have facilities in many foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to taxation at various rates and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate or in the countries from which we purchase raw materials, changes in laws and regulations governing calculation and location of earned profit and taxation thereof, changes in laws and regulations affecting our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and changes in laws and regulations relating to the repatriation of cash into the United States. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability may change.\nWe have undertaken a number of complex internal reorganizations of our foreign subsidiaries in order to rationalize and streamline our foreign operations, focus our management efforts on certain local opportunities and take advantage of favorable business conditions in certain localities. While we have exercised diligence in undertaking these internal reorganizations, there can be no assurance that these reorganizations, or any future internal reorganization, will not result in adverse tax consequences in the United States or in foreign countries in which we have operations. This could adversely impact our profitability from foreign operations and result in a material reduction in our results of operations.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations, including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, and the imposition or acceleration of taxation on certain foreign income, each of which may increase our tax expense. Both the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and subsequent regulations and interpretations require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As additional clarification and guidance is issued regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nVarious other jurisdictions, including members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are considering changes to their tax laws, including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers. Any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above.\nUNCERTAINTY AND VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS.\nFinancial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced extreme disruption in the recent past. Such disruption included, among other things, volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of sovereign debt, declining valuation of certain investments, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, volatility in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. Such conditions have had a significant adverse impact on our industry, our financial condition and results of operations. There may be further changes in the global economy, which could lead to further challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial results. For example, the U.K. vote in favor of leaving the European Union may cause instability and uncertainty in European economies and may negatively impact the outlook for the global economy. Tightness of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a\ndecrease in orders and spending for our products and services. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of any disruption in regional or global financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they may have on our business and financial condition. If uncertain economic conditions return or deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be further materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING IN THE FUTURE AND REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have approximately an aggregate principal amount of $950.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, including our 4.625% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d, and the indenture that governs the Notes, the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and our senior secured term loan facility due 2025 (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d). In addition, we have approximately $300 million of unutilized capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility due 2023 (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d, and together with the Term Loan Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d, and the credit agreement that governs the Credit Facilities, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d).\nOur debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Credit Facilities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest expense as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities, include variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\npreventing us from raising funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain change of control repurchase events, which could constitute a default under the Indenture;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the Indenture and the Credit Agreement contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our debt.\nDESPITE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS, WE MAY STILL BE ABLE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DEBT, WHICH COULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE RISKS TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, the restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, such as indebtedness to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, or other purposes, and the additional indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, the Credit Agreement provides that we have the right to request additional loans and commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of $400 million and 100% of EBITDA and additional amounts if our secured net leverage ratio is less than a specified ratio or, in the case of unsecured loans or other unsecured debt, or loans or other debt secured by junior liens, if our total net leverage ratio is less than a specified ratio. The Indenture does not limit the Company\u2019s ability to incur unsecured indebtedness. Moreover, the restrictions in the Indenture on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications that may permit us to incur a substantial amount of additional secured indebtedness. Further, although the Indenture limits the ability of a non-guarantor subsidiary to incur indebtedness unless it also guarantees the Notes, this limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications, and the amount of indebtedness incurred in compliance with the Indenture could be substantial. These restrictions do not prevent us from incurring monetary obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we add new indebtedness and other monetary obligations to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY BE FORCED TO TAKE OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR INDEBTEDNESS.\nWe may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as certain financial, business, legislative, political, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, and our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions is restricted by the agreements governing our indebtedness, and we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, and holders of the Notes and lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Facility could terminate their commitments to advance further loans, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nTHE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT RESTRICT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGES OR TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS OR RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to take action that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nmerge or sell all or substantially all of our assets or incur a change of control in our capital stock ownership.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement may, at certain times based on the outstanding amount of revolving borrowings, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit, require us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans and could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u2022\nfinance our operations;\n\u2022\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;\n\u2022\nwithstand a future downturn in our business, the industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\ncompete effectively and engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and\n\u2022\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nTHE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE IN THE PAST AND MAY BE VOLATILE IN THE FUTURE.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future. In 2018, the closing price of our stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, ranged from a low of $24.44 to a high of $38.85, and, as in past years, the price of our common stock may show greater volatility.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control or may be unrelated to our operating results, and which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including the following: the failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; press releases or announcements by, or changes in market values of, comparable companies; volatility in the markets for high-technology stocks, general stock market price and volume fluctuations, which are particularly common among securities of high-technology companies; stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels; the public perception of equity values of publicly traded companies and the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Such fluctuations in our results could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance. Future decreases in our stock price may adversely impact our ability to raise sufficient additional capital in the future, if needed.\nTHERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DECLARE CASH DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASE OUR SHARES AT ALL OR IN ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNTS\nOur Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend in November 2017. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that such actions are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and applicable agreements. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nPROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW MAY DELAY OR PREVENT AN ACQUISITION OF US, WHICH COULD DECREASE THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\nYOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN US MAY BE DILUTED BY FUTURE ISSUANCES OF CAPITAL STOCK, WHICH COULD REDUCE YOUR INFLUENCE OVER MATTERS ON WHICH STOCKHOLDERS VOTE.\nSubject to applicable NASDAQ standards, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares. Issuances of common stock or the exercise of employee stock options would dilute your percentage ownership interest, which will have the effect of reducing your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote. In addition, we may issue substantial quantities of our common stock in order to effect acquisitions which would also dilute your ownership interest. If the issuances are made at prices that reflect a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock, your interest in the book value of our common stock might be diluted.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Merger with Versum Materials, Inc.\nFAILURE TO COMPLETE OUR PENDING MERGER WITH VERSUM MATERIALS, INC. (VERSUM) COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR STOCK PRICE.\nOn January 27, 2019, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Versum will merge with and into Entegris. We will incur significant transaction costs relating to the merger, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, regulatory and other expenses. In general, these expenses are payable by us whether or not the merger is completed. If the merger is not completed under specific circumstances provided in the agreement and plan of merger, we may be required to pay Versum a termination fee of $155 million. The payment of such transaction costs or termination fees could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to litigation in the event the merger is not consummated, which could subject us to significant liability for damages and result in the incurrence of substantial legal fees. The current market price of our stock may reflect an assumption that the pending merger will occur and failure to complete the merger could result in a decline in our stock price.", "PERMNO": 88439, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ENTG"}
