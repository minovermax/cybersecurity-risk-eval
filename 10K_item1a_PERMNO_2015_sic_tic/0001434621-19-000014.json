{"cik": "1434621", "company": "LendingTree, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report and the information incorporated by reference herein. If any of the risks described below, or incorporated by reference into this annual report actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See the information included under the heading \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.\"\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAdverse conditions in the primary and secondary mortgage markets, as well as the general economy, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstraints in the primary and secondary mortgage markets have in the past had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Generally, increases in interest rates adversely affect the ability of our mortgage Network Partners to close loans, and adverse economic trends limit the ability of our mortgage Network Partners to offer home loans other than low-margin conforming loans. Our businesses may experience a decline in demand for their offerings due to decreased consumer demand as a result of the conditions described above, now or in the future. The decreased consumer demand for mortgage refinancing typically leads to decreased traffic to our website and higher associated selling and marketing efforts associated with that traffic. While higher lender demand during these periods often leads to an increase in the amount lenders will pay per matched lead and higher revenue earned per consumer, increases in the amount lenders will pay per matched lead in this situation is limited by the overall cost models of our lenders, and our revenue earned per consumer can be adversely affected by the overall reduced demand for refinancing in a rising rate environment. These factors combined to cause lower revenue earned per consumer in the second half of 2018 compared to the prior year period. Conversely, during periods with decreased interest rates, mortgage Network Partners have less incentive to use our marketplaces, or in the case of sudden increases in consumer demand, our mortgage Network Partners may lack the ability to support sudden increases in volume.\nWe depend on relationships with Network Partners and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in significant part on the financial strength of lenders and lead purchasers participating on our marketplaces and continuing relationships with such lenders and lead purchases. Network Partners could, for any reason, experience financial difficulties and cease participating on our marketplaces, fail to pay match and/or closing fees when due and/or drop the quality of their services to consumers. We could also have commercial or other disputes with such Network Partners from time to time. The occurrence of one or more of these events with a significant number of Network Partners could, alone or in combination, have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to meet certain metrics required by Network Partners, then our business and financial results may be harmed.\nWe compete against other online marketing companies in significant part based on the quality and convertibility of the leads we generate. Network Partners have expectations as to the quality and conversion rate of the leads that we generate. These expectations sometimes change over time. The leads that we supply to Network Partners may not meet the expectations that they have for such leads. Conversion rates for leads may be impacted by factors other than the lead quality, many of which are outside our control. Such factors include competition in lending and insurance markets and sales practices of Network Partners. Failure to meet the expectations of Network Partners in terms of quality and convertibility of leads may result in reduced fees paid to us by such Network Partners, or in extreme cases, the loss of one or more Network Partners, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain brand recognition and attract and retain consumers in a cost-effective manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to attract visitors to our websites, convert these visitors into loan or other financial product requests for our Network Partners and lead purchasers and generate repeat visits from consumers, our businesses must promote and maintain their various brands. Brand promotion and maintenance requires the expenditure of considerable money and resources for online and offline advertising, marketing and related efforts, as well as the continued provision and introduction of high-quality products and services.\nBrand recognition is a key differentiating factor among providers of online services. We believe that continuing to build and maintain the recognition of our various brands is critical to achieving increased demand for the services provided by our businesses. Accordingly, we have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant amounts on, and devote significant resources to, branding, advertising and other marketing initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective. The failure of our businesses to maintain the recognition of their respective brands and attract and retain consumers in a cost-effective manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse publicity from legal proceedings against us or our businesses, including governmental proceedings and consumer class action litigation, or from the disclosure of information security breaches, could negatively impact our various brands, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the actions of our third-party marketing partners who engage in advertising on our behalf could negatively impact our various brands. Furthermore, adverse publicity and the potential corresponding impact on our reputation may be accelerated and amplified by the widespread use of social media platforms.\nWe depend on search engines, online advertising and other online sources to attract visitors to our websites, and if we are unable to attract these visitors and convert them into consumer requests for our Network Partners in a cost-effective manner, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract online consumers to our websites and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner. We depend, in part, on search engines, online advertising and other online sources for our website traffic. We are included in search results as a result of both paid search listings, where we purchase specific search terms that result in the inclusion of our advertisement, and, separately, organic searches, that depend upon the searchable content on our sites. Search engines and other online sources revise their algorithms, and introduce new advertising products, from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results.\nIf one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for website traffic were to modify its general methodology for how it displays our websites, resulting in fewer consumers clicking through to our websites, our business could suffer. If any free search engine traffic on which we rely begins charging fees for listing or placement, or if one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for purchased listings, modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, we could lose customers, and traffic to our websites could decrease, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if our online advertisements are not able to reach certain consumers due to consumers\u2019 use of ad-blocking software, our business could suffer.\nWe compete with a number of other online marketing companies, and we face the possibility of new competitors.\nWe currently compete with a number of other online marketing companies and we expect that competition will intensify. Some of these existing competitors may have more capital or complementary products or services than we do, and they may leverage their greater capital or diversification in a manner that adversely affects our competitive position, including by making strategic acquisitions. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and may be able to innovate and bring products and services to market faster, or anticipate and meet consumer or Network Partner demand before we do. Other newcomers, including major search engines and content aggregators, may be able to leverage their existing products and services or access to data to our disadvantage. We may be forced to expend significant resources to remain competitive with current and potential competitors. If any of our competitors are more successful than we are at attracting and retaining customers or Network Partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, including websites, information and related systems, call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures may materially and adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. We may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders. We also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems and infrastructures, our businesses, our affiliates and/or third parties, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures, could impair the ability of our businesses to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, unauthorized intrusions or computer viruses, and similar\nevents or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent our businesses from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. While our businesses have backup systems for certain aspects of their operations, these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also in the process of transitioning certain product exchanges to a new technology platform. The risks associated with this transition include, but are not limited to, operational implementation, downtimes, and diversion of management and technical resources. If the transition to the new platform is more challenging or time consuming than expected, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nBreaches or failures of our network and website security, the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure or misappropriation of personal consumer information, the occurrence of fraudulent activity, or other data security-related incidents may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBreaches or failures of security involving our systems and website or those of any of our affiliated third-parties may occur, and could result in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of personal consumer information, fraudulent activity, or system disruptions or shutdowns. Any breach, penetration, or failure of network security or theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure or misappropriate of personal consumer information collected, processed, or maintained by us or our affiliated third-parties could cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses and subject us to increased costs, litigation, and other liabilities. The occurrence of any real or attempted breach, penetration, or failure of security, or the reporting of such an incident, whether accurate or not, could result in claims made against us or our third-party affiliates for the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of personal information, which could result in state and/or federal litigation and related financial liabilities, as well as criminal penalties or civil liabilities and regulatory actions from state and/or federal governmental authorities. Real or perceived security breaches or failures could also significantly damage our brand and reputation with consumers and third parties with whom we do business and result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, and reduced sales and profits.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any potential, attempted, or existing security breaches or failures and their consequences. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business. Consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the Internet, and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses and/or those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are susceptible to fraudulent activity and data security-related incidents that may be committed against us, our Network Partners or external service providers which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us, disclosure or misuse of our information, theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure or misappropriation of personal information, misappropriation of assets, privacy litigation, regulatory actions, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent and malicious activity may take many forms, including check fraud, fraudulent inducement, electronic fraud, wire fraud, computer viruses, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts, any of which could be the result of a circumvention or failure of our data security processes, procedures, tools, and controls. Information security breaches and failures may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us, Network Partners, or external service providers, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware, such as ransomware, or other cyber-attacks. We rely on a framework of security, processes, procedures, tools, and controls designed to protect our information and assets, but despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and website, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security breaches or failures and fraudulent activity, especially because the methods of attack and deception change frequently and because such conduct can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as external service providers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLitigation and indemnification of secondary market purchasers, including a pending case brought by Residential Funding Company, LLC, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn connection with the sale of loans to secondary market purchasers, Home Loan Center, Inc. (\"HLC\") may be liable for certain indemnification, repurchase and premium repayment obligations. For example, in connection with the sale of loans to secondary market purchasers, HLC made certain representations regarding related borrower credit information, loan documentation and collateral. To the extent that these representations were incorrect, HLC may be required to repurchase loans or indemnify secondary market purchasers for losses due to borrower defaults. HLC has made payments for these liabilities in the past and expects to make payments for these liabilities in the future.\nWe continue to be liable for these indemnification obligations, repurchase obligations and premium repayment obligations following the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of our LendingTree Loans business. We have in the past and intend to continue to negotiate in the future with secondary market purchasers to settle any existing and future contingent liabilities, but we cannot assure you we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the case of Residential Funding Company, LLC v Home Loan Center, Inc., went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict of $28.7 million in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is also seeking up to $28.8 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and $30.6 million in pre-judgment interest in addition to the jury verdict amount. As of February 28, 2019, the court has not yet entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. HLC believes it has strong grounds for appeal and further believes that the plaintiff\u2019s demand for attorneys\u2019 fees and pre-judgment interest is excessive (and, if granted, would be subject to appeal). HLC intends to vigorously pursue an appeal but we cannot assure you that the appeal will be successful or that even if successful on certain theories, the plaintiff would not receive a substantial recovery upon retrial or otherwise. See Note 15 - Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We have incurred substantial legal fees in this matter. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016-Discontinued Operations.\nThe ultimate outcome of the Residential Funding Company, LLC matter and the outcomes of other pending of indemnification claims, repurchase obligations or premium repayments beyond our reserves for these contingencies, including legal fees we incur, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the mortgage industry.\nDeclines in the housing market from 2006 through early 2012, as measured by the S&P/Case-Schiller 20-city composite home price index, with home price declines and increased foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but subsequently of other asset-backed securities, credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities, in turn, caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail.\nReflecting concern about the stability of the housing markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market disruption and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence and increased market volatility. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has had in the past and may have in the future, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile conditions in the housing markets have improved since 2013, the failure to sustain such improvements could have adverse effects on us and our mortgage Network Partners. Further, our business could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other businesses in the financial services sector, including our non-lender lead purchasers. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more of these entities, or the financial services industry generally, have in the past, and may in the future, lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to disruptions in the financial technology industry. Any such disruption could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue growth in 2017 and 2018 has been driven by our credit card product.\nOur credit card product offering is subject to particular risks:\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the economy may affect credit card issuers and their willingness to issue new credit;\n\u2022\ncredit losses among credit card issuers may increase beyond normal and budgeted levels which could cause a reduction in demand;\n\u2022\ninterest rate increases may make balance transfer cards less profitable for issuers;\n\u2022\ncredit card issuers and other advertisers in the business verticals in which we operate may be unwilling to advertise on our websites or mobile applications;\n\u2022\nchanges in application approval rates by credit card issuer customers;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and its effect on our website traffic, click-through rates, advertising rates, revenue, margins, and market share;\n\u2022\nability to provide competitive service to credit card issuers and to consumers using our online offerings and other platforms;\n\u2022\ncredit card issuers may determine that the online digital marketing channel is no longer a viable marketing platform for generating new credit card customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain brand recognition for both LendingTree and CompareCards and to effectively leverage the LendingTree brand with the CompareCards brand; and\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new products and services and enhance existing ones.\nIf our credit card product is impacted by the risks described above, then our results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue growth in 2018 has been driven by our insurance leads business through our acquisition of QuoteWizard, which was completed in October 2018.\nThe QuoteWizard acquisition poses risks for our ongoing operations, including, among others:\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the economy may affect insurance carriers and their willingness to issue policies;\n\u2022\ncovered losses among insurance carriers may increase beyond normal and budgeted levels which could cause a reduction in demand;\n\u2022\ninsurance carriers and other advertisers in the business verticals in which we or QuoteWizard operate may be unwilling to advertise on our or QuoteWizard\u2019s websites or mobile applications;\n\u2022\nchanges in underwriting approval rates by insurance carrier customers;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and its effect on our or QuoteWizard\u2019s website traffic, click-through rates, advertising rates, revenue, margins, and market share;\n\u2022\nability to provide competitive service to insurance carriers and to consumers using QuoteWizard\u2019s and our online offerings and other platforms;\n\u2022\ninsurance carriers may determine that the online digital marketing channel is no longer a viable marketing platform for generating new insurance customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain brand recognition for both LendingTree and QuoteWizard and to effectively leverage the LendingTree brand with the QuoteWizard brand;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new products and services and enhance existing ones;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees of QuoteWizard;\n\u2022\ncosts and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities;\n\u2022\nthat the business acquired in the acquisition may not continue to perform as well as anticipated; and\n\u2022\nassumed liabilities associated with QuoteWizard\u2019s historical operations, including liabilities arising from privacy and security regulations or security breaches.\nIf the QuoteWizard business is impacted by the risks described above, then our results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nA portion of our revenue growth in recent years has been driven by personal loan offerings. If lenders participating on our marketplace decide to reduce their offerings of personal loans or if such loans become unattractive to consumers because of higher interest rates demanded by lenders, then our results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRevenue from personal loan offerings was responsible for a significant portion of the growth in the non-mortgage revenue over the last few years. Revenue from our personal loan product increased $46.0 million in 2018 from 2017 and $21.7 million in 2017 from 2016.\nPersonal loans are unsecured obligations and generally carry shorter terms and smaller loan amounts than mortgages. Because they are unsecured, they are generally riskier assets for lenders than mortgages or other secured loans. Consumer demand for unsecured loans offered on our marketplace is often for refinancing of higher interest credit card debt or for a lower interest alternative to credit card debt for a contemplated larger purchase that would otherwise be purchased with a credit card. Lenders\nparticipating on our marketplace may reduce their willingness to make personal loans at more attractive interest rates than credit card debt and may for that reason, or for any other reason, reduce their demand for personal consumer requests generated from our personal loan marketplace. Reasons that lenders might reduce their willingness to make personal loans at attractive interest rates may include regulatory changes, stricter institutional lending criteria, a lack of adequate funding sources or capital for loan originations, or increased borrower default levels, which may occur upon adverse changes in regional, national or global economic conditions. Additionally, lenders may tighten their underwriting standards, making it more difficult for consumers to qualify for personal loans. If lenders participating on our marketplace decide to reduce their offerings of personal loans, tighten their underwriting standards, or if personal loans become unattractive to consumers because of higher interest rates demanded by lenders, then our results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nNetwork Partners affiliated with our marketplaces are not precluded from offering products and services outside of our marketplaces, or obtaining products and services from our competitors.\nBecause our businesses do not have exclusive relationships with Network Partners, consumers may obtain loans and other financial products from these third-party service providers without having to use our marketplaces. Network Partners can offer loans and other financial products directly to consumers through their own marketing campaigns or other traditional methods of distribution, such as referral arrangements, physical store-front operations or broker agreements. Network Partners may also offer loans and other financial products and services to prospective customers online directly, through one or more online competitors of our businesses, or both. If a significant number of consumers seek loans and other financial products and services directly from Network Partners or through our competitors as opposed to through our marketplaces, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of our non-mortgage products are new to the market and may fail to achieve or maintain customer acceptance and profitability.\nWe have launched a number of new non-mortgage products over the last several years. We do not have as much experience with these new non-mortgage products as with the mortgage products and our other mature non-mortgage products. Accordingly, new non-mortgage products may be subject to greater risks than our more mature products.\nThe success of new products we may offer will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nImplementing, at an acceptable cost, product features offered by our competitors and/or expected by consumers, lenders and lead purchasers;\n\u2022\nMarket acceptance by consumers, lenders and lead purchasers;\n\u2022\nOfferings by current and future competitors;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain management and other skilled personnel for these businesses;\n\u2022\nOur ability to collect amounts owed to us from third parties;\n\u2022\nOur ability to develop successful and cost-effective marketing campaigns; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to timely adjust marketing expenditures in relation to changes in demand for the underlying products and services offered by our Network Partners.\nOur results of operations may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with new products.\nIf we are unable to continually enhance our products and services and adapt them to technological changes and consumer and lender and/or lead purchaser needs, including the emergence of new computing devices and more sophisticated online services, we may lose market share and revenue and our business could suffer.\nWe need to anticipate, develop and introduce new products, services and applications on a timely and cost-effective basis that keep pace with technological developments and changing consumer and customer needs. For example, the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as tablets, mobile telephones, voice assistants, televisions and set-top box devices has increased significantly and this trend is likely to continue. Because each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, our websites may not be functional or viewable on these devices. Additionally, new devices and new platforms are continually being released. Consumers access many traditional web services on mobile devices through applications, or apps.\nIt is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in improving our websites' functionality with these alternative devices or developing apps for mobile platforms. If we fail to develop our websites or apps to respond to these or other technological developments and changing consumer and customer needs cost effectively, or if consumers and customers respond negatively to\nchanges, we may lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe improve our products and services in ways that forego short-term gains.\nWe are constantly striving to improve the user experience for our consumers who use our websites and applications and for our Network Partners. Some of our changes may have the effect of reducing our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the benefits will ultimately improve our financial performance over the long-term. Any short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than we anticipate or these decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our intellectual property rights, including patents, service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and similar intellectual property (as applicable), as critical to our success. Our businesses also rely heavily upon software codes, informational databases and other components that make up their products and services.\nWe rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or registered intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.\nWe have generally registered and continue to apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our principal trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve and register domain names when and where we deem appropriate. We generally consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation. While we vigorously protect our trademarks, service marks and domain names, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names or otherwise, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been granted patents and from time to time we may have patent applications pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions. The status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions, and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. Accordingly, any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued, or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own.\nLikewise, the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that our processes or inventions will be found not to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business we are subjected to legal proceedings, claims and counterclaims, or threatened legal proceedings, claims or counterclaims, including allegations relating to misappropriation of trade secrets or infringement of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating our risk of loss.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and strategic risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. There may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe intended benefits of recent acquisitions may not be realized.\nOur acquisitions pose risks for our ongoing operations, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthat senior management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of the businesses acquired in the acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to retain key employees of businesses acquired;\n\u2022\ncosts and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities;\n\u2022\nthat the businesses acquired in the acquisition may not perform as well as anticipated;\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the economy may affect the lenders or customers of the acquired businesses and their willingness to issue new credit;\n\u2022\nadvertisers in the business verticals in which we or the acquired businesses operate may be unwilling to advertise on our websites or mobile applications;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and its effect on our or the acquired businesses' website traffic, click-through rates, submitted consumer requests, advertising rates, revenue, margins, and market share;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain brand recognition for both us and the acquired businesses and to effectively leverage the LendingTree brand with the newly acquired brands;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new products and services and enhance existing ones;\n\u2022\nassumed liabilities associated with the historical operations of the acquired businesses, including as a result of privacy regulations or data breaches.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our acquisitions may not be accretive to us in the near term or at all. Furthermore, if we fail to realize the intended benefits of the business acquired in the acquisition, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the market price reflects an expectation of those benefits.\nOther acquisitions or strategic investments that we pursue may not be successful and could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe may consider or undertake strategic acquisitions of, or material investments in, businesses, products or technologies. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, or even if we do identify suitable candidates, they may be difficult to finance, expensive to fund and there is no guarantee that we can obtain any necessary regulatory approvals or complete such transactions on terms that are favorable to us. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, it would reduce our cash balances and/or result in indebtedness we must service, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If the purchase price is paid with our stock, it would be dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, we may assume liabilities associated with a business acquisition or investment, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition. There may also be litigation or other claims arising in connection with an acquisition itself.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the personnel, operations, businesses, products or technologies of an acquisition or investment. Integration may be particularly challenging if we enter into a line of business in which we have limited experience and the business operates in a difficult legal, regulatory or competitive environment. We may find that we do not have adequate operations or expertise to manage the new business. The integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management's time and resources from our core business, which could impair our relationships with our current employees, customers and strategic partners and disrupt our operations. Acquisitions and investments also may not perform to our expectations for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel or customers. If we fail to integrate acquisitions or investments or realize the expected benefits, we may lose the return on these acquisitions or investments or incur additional transaction costs and our business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid and significant growth in our headcount and operations, including as a result of acquisitions, which places substantial demand on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our services and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our management team and our highly skilled employees, including our software engineers, analysts, marketing professionals and sales staff. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially and adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken and to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nNetwork Partners on our marketplaces may not provide competitive levels of service to consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our brands and businesses and their ability to attract consumers.\nThe ability of our businesses to provide consumers with a high-quality experience depends, in part, on consumers receiving competitive levels of convenience, customer service, price and responsiveness from Network Partners participating on our other marketplaces with whom they are matched. If these providers do not provide consumers with competitive levels of convenience, customer service, price and responsiveness, the value of our various brands may be harmed, the ability of our businesses to attract consumers to our websites may be limited and the number of consumers matched through our marketplaces may decline, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our total revenue is derived from two Network Partners, and our results from operations could be adversely affected and stockholder value harmed if we lose significant business from either of these Network Partners.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, one Network Partner accounted for 11% and 15% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, another Network Partner accounted for 13% of total revenue. If either of these significant Network Partners were to cease purchasing consumer requests and we were unable to replace the associated demand, the loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the short term and potentially also the longer term. Also, if either Network Partner reduces its volume of consumer requests for any reason, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur current lack of geographic diversity exposes us to risk.\nOther than a support services office in India, our operations are geographically limited to and dependent upon the economic condition of the United States. As a result of this geographical concentration, we are more vulnerable to downturns or other conditions that affect the US economy. We may choose to expand our operations in order to increase our geographic diversity, and if we do, such expansion would place increased responsibilities on our management, divert resources from other operations and expose us to new risks of foreign operations.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the past and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable over the long term.\nWe have incurred operating losses from continuing operations at times in our history, and although we were profitable in 2016, 2017 and 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $610.5 million at December 31, 2018. If we fail to maintain or grow our revenue and manage our expenses, we may incur significant losses in the future and not be able to maintain profitability.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which legislation significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This tax legislation significantly reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in a given period. However, the tax legislation also included a number of provisions, including, but not limited to, the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits (including for interest expense and for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code), the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their character, and the limitation of asset basis under certain circumstances, that could significantly and adversely affect our U.S. federal income tax position. The legislation also made changes to the tax rules applicable to financial institutions and other entities with which we do business.\nWe revalued deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 in light of the changes in the TCJA, and we recorded a net tax expense of $9.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe impact of the TCJA and associated anticipated regulations on future years may be material to our consolidated financial statements. For example, we have historically relied extensively on performance-based compensation for our executive officers. The non-deductibility of future performance-based compensation to executive officers, and the expanded definition of \u201ccovered employees\u201d whose compensation is subject to Section 162(m) may have material adverse effects on our effective tax rates. In addition, the limitations on the deductibility of interest may affect our anticipated tax benefits for the convertible note and hedge transactions described in Note 13-Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is uncertain and could be adverse. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our Network Partners or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had pre-tax consolidated federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $203.5 million. The federal NOLs no longer expire under the new TCJA. Our NOLs will be available to offset taxable income subject to the limitations found in Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383. In addition, we have state NOLs of approximately $498.5 million at December 31, 2018, that will expire at various times between 2020 and 2038. If we experience one or more ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited. Our ability to use our NOLs was limited by the TCJA. See \"U.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\"\nWe will need to relocate our corporate headquarters due to our growth and we may experience costs and risks associated with our ownership of a two-building office complex we purchased in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nOur principal executive offices are currently located in approximately 37,800 square feet of office space in Charlotte, North Carolina under a lease that expires in December 2020. We have determined that we will need to relocate our principal executive offices to accommodate our growth and we are in the process of selecting an alternative site. We will incur relocation costs associated with the movement of employees to a new principal executive office or other sites. We may experience loss of employees or lost employee productivity resulting from this relocation and other work location changes necessitated by our growth. Any of these costs and risks may negatively impact our earnings and cause our stock price to decline.\nIn December 2016, we completed the purchase of two office buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina for an aggregate purchase price of $23.5 million. We currently lease a portion of this space to other tenants. We acquired these buildings with the intent to use such buildings as our principal executive offices in the future, and rent any unused space. In November 2018, our board of directors approved a plan to sell these two office buildings and they were classified as held for sale. In February 2019, we agreed to sell these buildings to an unrelated third party. For additional information, see Item 9B. Other Information and Note 7 - Assets Held For Sale in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. There are costs and risks associated with our leasing and holding this real estate for sale, including:\n\u2022\nreal estate taxes and maintenance costs;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties or lease defaults by our tenants;\n\u2022\ntenant turnover and loss of potential tenants to competing landlords;\n\u2022\nactions by competing landlords that may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties;\n\u2022\ncosts of compliance with governmental rules and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, and zoning laws and potential liability thereunder;\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost or availability of adequate insurance, including coverage for mold and asbestos;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with environmental conditions or retained liabilities for such conditions;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with remodeling the buildings;\n\u2022\nsecuring required governmental construction, zoning or other approvals and permits;\n\u2022\nmanagement of modifications in the design to the size and scope of the remodeling or other unforeseen engineering problems;\n\u2022\nexposure to real estate market conditions affecting the marketability and realizable value of the property;\n\u2022\nthe risk that binding purchase agreements for the sale of properties such as these buildings customarily have a post-signing inspection period during which the buyer is able to terminate the agreement with limited remedies to us as the seller; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for retained liabilities following a sale, such as those imposed under environmental laws or that we may otherwise agree to.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Failure to comply with the terms of any such facility could impair our rights to the assets that have been pledged as collateral under the facility.\nOn November 21, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary LendingTree, LLC entered into an amended and restated $250.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility which matures on November 21, 2022 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). On October 26, 2018, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility to increase its borrowing capacity by $100.0 million to $350.0 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility can be used to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes, including to finance permitted acquisitions. As of February 28, 2019, there was $195.0 million borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a restrictive financial covenant, which limits the total consolidated debt to an EBITDA ratio. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, subject to certain exceptions, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ngrant liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or make certain fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, including dividends, distributions, stock repurchases or redemptions;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into hedging transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility requires LendingTree, LLC to pledge as collateral, subject to certain customary exclusions, substantially all of its assets, including 100% of its equity in all of its domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the voting equity, and 100% of the non-voting equity, in all of its material foreign subsidiaries (of which there are currently none). The obligations under this facility are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by LendingTree, Inc. and material domestic subsidiaries of LendingTree, LLC, which guaranties are secured by a pledge as collateral, subject to certain customary exclusions, of 100% of each such guarantor's assets, including 100% of each such guarantor\u2019s equity in all of its domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the voting equity, and 100% of the non-voting equity, in all of its material foreign subsidiaries (of which there are currently none).\nIf an event of default occurs or if we otherwise fail to comply with any of the negative or affirmative covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders may declare all of the obligations and indebtedness under such facility due and payable. In such a scenario, the lenders could exercise their lien on the pledged collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information on the Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 13-Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIf our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry or our customers' industries. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during a period in which any impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nCharges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results.\nUnder GAAP, when we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired at their acquisition date fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. We also estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are uncertain and involve significant judgments by management. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows:\n\u2022\ncosts incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention or relocation expenses;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022\na reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nidentification of, or changes to, assumed contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of any contingent consideration;\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results due to duplicative pre-merger activities;\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and\n\u2022\ncharges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition.\nSubstantially all of these potential charges would be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our acquisitions and the extent of acquisition accounting adjustments.\nFor acquisitions with potential future contingent consideration payments, we assign a fair value to the contingent consideration and reassess this fair value quarterly. Increases or decreases based on the actual performance of the acquired company against the contingent consideration targets or other factors will cause decreases or increases, respectively, in our results of operations. These quarterly adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During 2018 and 2017, we incurred $10.8 million and $23.9 million, respectively, of contingent consideration expense due to the change in estimated fair value of the earnout payments.\nRisks Related to Compliance and Regulation\nFailure to comply with past, existing or new laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain and maintain required licenses, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe market and provide services in heavily regulated industries through a number of different channels across the United States. As a result, our businesses have been and remain subject to a variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions in the United States, which are subject to change at any time. The failure of our businesses to comply with past, existing or new laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain and maintain required licenses, could result in administrative fines and/or proceedings against us or our businesses by governmental agencies and/or litigation by consumers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our brand.\nOur businesses conduct marketing activities via the telephone, the mail and/or through online marketing channels, which general marketing activities are governed by numerous federal and state regulations, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, state\ntelemarketing laws, federal and state privacy laws, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act and its accompanying regulations and guidelines, among others. Increased regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") has resulted in restrictions on telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers.\nAdditional federal, state and in some instances, local laws regulate secured and unsecured lending activities, which impacts the marketplace, lenders and consumers. These laws generally regulate the manner in which lending and lending-related activities are marketed or made available, including advertising and other consumer disclosures, payments for services and record keeping requirements; these laws include RESPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and various state laws. State laws often restrict the amount (and nature) of interest and fees that may be charged by a lender or mortgage broker, or otherwise regulate the manner in which lenders or mortgage brokers operate or advertise.\nState, federal and foreign lending laws and regulations generally require accurate disclosure of the critical components of credit costs so that consumers can readily compare credit terms from various lenders. These laws and regulations also impose certain restrictions on the advertisement of these credit terms. Because we are an aggregator of rate and other information regarding many financial products, including mortgages, deposits and credit cards, we may be subject to some of these laws and regulations and we may be held liable under these laws and regulations for information provided through our online services. The insurance industry is also subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including licensing requirements.\nOur operations in India may subject us to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of or inability to renew required licenses or registrations, loss of approval status, termination of contracts without compensation, administrative enforcement actions and fines, private lawsuits, including those styled as class actions, cease and desist orders and civil and criminal liability.\nMost states require licenses to solicit, broker or make loans secured by residential mortgages and other consumer loans to residents of those states, as well as to operate real estate referral and brokerage services, and in many cases require the licensure or registration of individual employees engaged in aspects of these businesses. Further, as mandated by the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (the \"SAFE Act\"), states adopted certain minimum standards for the licensing of individuals involved in mortgage lending or loan brokering. Compliance with these requirements may render it more difficult for us and our Network Partners to operate or may raise our internal costs or the costs of our Network Partners, which may be passed on to us through less favorable commercial arrangements. While our businesses have endeavored to comply with applicable requirements, the application of these requirements to persons operating online is not always clear. Moreover, any of the licenses or rights currently held by our businesses or our employees may be revoked prior to, or may not be renewed upon, their expiration. In addition, our businesses or our employees may not be granted new licenses or rights for which they may be required to apply from time to time in the future.\nLikewise, states or municipalities may adopt statutes or regulations making it unattractive, impracticable or infeasible for our businesses to continue to conduct business in such jurisdictions. The withdrawal from any jurisdiction due to emerging legal requirements could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are also subject to various state, federal and/or local laws, rules and regulations that regulate the amount and nature of fees that may be charged for transactions and incentives, such as rebates, that may be offered to consumers by our businesses, as well as the manner in which these businesses may offer, advertise or promote transactions. For example, RESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of referral fees and fee shares or splits in connection with residential mortgage loan transactions, subject to certain exceptions. The applicability of referral fee and fee sharing prohibitions to lenders and real estate providers, including online networks, may have the effect of reducing the types and amounts of fees that may be charged or paid in connection with real estate-secured loan offerings or activities, including mortgage brokerage, lending and real estate brokerage services, or otherwise limiting our and our Network Partners' ability to conduct marketing and referral activities.\nVarious federal, state and, in some instances, local, laws also prohibit unfair and deceptive sales practices. We have adopted appropriate policies and procedures to address these requirements (such as appropriate consumer disclosures and call scripting, call monitoring and other quality assurance and compliance measures), but it is not possible to ensure that all employees comply with our policies and procedures at all times.\nCompliance with these laws, rules and regulations is a significant component of our internal costs, and new laws, rules and regulations are frequently proposed and adopted, requiring us to adopt new procedures and practices. Changes to existing laws, rules and regulations or changes to interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations could result in further restriction of activities incidental to our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nParties through which our businesses conduct business similarly may be subject to federal and state regulation. These parties typically act as independent contractors and not as agents in their solicitations and transactions with consumers. We cannot ensure that these entities will comply with applicable laws and regulations at all times. Failure on the part of a lender, website operator or other third party to comply with these laws or regulations could result in, among other things, claims of vicarious liability or a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nRegulatory authorities and private plaintiffs may allege that we failed to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations where we believe we have complied. These allegations may relate to past conduct and/or past business operations, such as our discontinued mortgage origination operation (which was subject to various state and local laws, rules and regulations). Even allegations that our activities have not complied or do not comply with all applicable laws and regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The alleged violation of such laws, rules or regulations may entitle an individual plaintiff to seek monetary damages, or may entitle an enforcing government agency to seek significant civil or criminal penalties, costs and attorneys' fees. Regardless of its merit, an allegation typically requires legal fee expenditures to defend against. We have in the past and may in the future decide to settle allegations of non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations when we determine that the cost of settlement is less than the cost and risk of continuing to defend against an allegation. Settlements may require us to pay monetary fines and may require us to adopt new procedures and practices, which may render it more difficult to operate or may raise our internal costs. The future occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn response to conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, as well as a heightened regulatory and Congressional focus on consumer lending, regulators have increased their scrutiny of the financial services industry, the result of which has included new regulations and guidance. We are unable to predict the long-term impact of this enhanced scrutiny. We are also unable to predict whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.\nThe collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nIn the processing of consumer transactions, our businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. The collection, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the privacy and data security policies maintained by us and our businesses. Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and data security, and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure, protection of, and a natural person's rights relating to and in their personally identifiable information and user data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. In the United States, regulations and interpretations concerning personally identifiable and data security promulgated by state and federal regulators, including the CFPB and FTC, could conflict or give rise to differing views of personal privacy rights. We could be materially and adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, procedures, and controls relating to the privacy and data security of personal information or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure, and/or the failure by the various third-party vendors and service providers with whom we do business, or the perceived failure, to comply with applicable privacy and data security policies, procedures, or controls, or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of these businesses, discourage potential users from our products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies and/or consumers, one or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the regulation of the Internet could negatively affect our business.\nLaws, rules and regulations governing Internet communications, advertising and e-commerce are dynamic and the extent of future government regulation is uncertain. Federal and state regulations govern various aspects of our online business, including intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, the distribution of electronic communications, marketing and advertising, user privacy and data security, search engines and Internet tracking technologies. Future taxation on the use of the Internet or e-commerce transactions could also be imposed. Existing or future regulation or taxation could hinder growth in or negatively impact the use of the Internet generally, including the viability of Internet e-commerce, which could reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses and expose us to significant liabilities.\nIf Network Partners fail to produce required documents for examination by, or other affiliated parties fail to make certain filings with, state regulators, we may be subject to fines, forfeitures and the revocation of required licenses.\nSome of the states in which our businesses maintain licenses require them to collect various loan documents from Network Partners and produce these documents for examination by state regulators. While Network Partners are contractually obligated to provide these documents upon request, these measures may be insufficient. Failure to produce required documents for examination could result in fines, as well as the revocation of our licenses to operate in certain states, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations promulgated by some states may impose compliance obligations on directors, executive officers, large customers and any person who acquires a certain percentage (for example, 10% or more) of the equity in a licensed entity, including requiring such persons to periodically file financial and other personal and business information with state regulators. If any such person refuses or fails to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to obtain certain licenses and existing licensing arrangements may be jeopardized. The inability to obtain, or the loss of, required licenses could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nFluctuations in our operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors may result in significant decreases in the price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile since our spin-off. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, causing significant price variations to occur. As of December 31, 2018, since our spin-off, the price per share of our common stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $1.42 per share to an intra-day high of $404.40 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating and financial results;\n\u2022\nvariations in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts' earnings estimates;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our Network Partners or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common shares or our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or preferred or common shares we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nactions by stockholders, including \"activist\" investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of other companies in our industry, including our customers and competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community, including short selling;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations affecting our industry or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions.\nRecently, and in the past, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the trading price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of your investment in our common shares. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business or financial results, including in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if those events do not directly affect us. You should also be aware that price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock are low. These factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for internet marketplace operators and lead-generation companies depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about the industry and specific companies. If one or more analysts covering us currently or in the future fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decline, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. If one or more recognized securities or industry analysts that cover our company or our industry in the future downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry, our stock price would likely decline.\nTwo holders of our common stock own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which concentrates voting control and limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of February 20, 2019, Douglas Lebda, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 17% of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, Mr. Lebda holds restricted stock unit awards representing 9,896 shares and options to purchase a maximum of 797,082 shares that are not included in beneficial ownership because Mr. Lebda does not have the right to acquire them within 60 days. If these restricted stock units were to settle and these options were exercisable, they would represent additional beneficial ownership of approximately 5% of our outstanding common stock. As of February 20, 2019, GCI Liberty, Inc. beneficially owned approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock. GCI Liberty, Inc. also has the right to nominate 20% of the total number of directors serving on the board, rounded up. Two of our ten directors, Neal Dermer and Craig Troyer, were nominated by Liberty Interactive Corporation, the predecessor in interest of GCI Liberty, Inc.\nTherefore, for the foreseeable future, Mr. Lebda and GCI Liberty, Inc. will each have influence over our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal (with or without cause) of directors and approval of any significant corporate transaction, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets. The interests of Mr. Lebda or GCI Liberty, Inc. may not necessarily align with the interests of our other stockholders. Mr. Lebda or GCI Liberty, Inc. could elect to sell a significant interest in us and you may receive less than the then-current fair market value or the price you paid for your shares as a result of such transaction. This concentrated control could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may otherwise support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock and might harm the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity incentive plans, or in connection with current or future acquisitions or financings. If we were to raise capital in the future by selling shares of our common stock, or securities that are convertible into our common stock or issuing shares of our common stock in a business acquisition, their issuance would have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our stockholders and, depending on the prices at which such shares or convertible securities are sold or issued, on their investment in our common stock and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the market prices of our common stock.\nUnder a registration rights agreement with GCI Liberty, Inc., GCI Liberty, Inc. and its permitted transferees are entitled to three demand registrations rights (and unlimited piggyback registration rights) in respect of the shares of our common stock received by GCI Liberty, Inc. as a result of the spin-off and other shares of our common stock acquired by GCI Liberty, Inc. or its affiliates. These holders will also be permitted to exercise their registration rights in connection with certain hedging transactions that they may enter into in respect of the registrable shares. The presence of additional shares of our common stock trading in the public market, as a result of the exercise of such registration rights, may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our management and affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nAuthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by our stockholders, up to five million shares of undesignated preferred stock, sometimes referred to as \"blank check preferred\";\n\u2022\nProhibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nProvide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office or by the sole remaining director;\n\u2022\nProvide that only our board of directors may change the size of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nSpecify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a person specifically designated with such authority by the board; and\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholders from taking action by written consent.\nThe provisions described above may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing our management. These provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, even if stockholders support such a change of control.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock during the six most recent fiscal years. We have no current intention to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. See Note 13-Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The declaration, payment and amount of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future for holders of our common stock.\nOur financial results fluctuate as a result of seasonality, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and may adversely affect our common stock price.\nOur mortgage products business is historically subject to seasonal trends. These trends reflect the general patterns of the mortgage industry and housing sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. In recent periods, broader cyclical trends in interest rates, as well as the mortgage and real estate markets, have upset the customary seasonal trends. However, seasonal trends may resume and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate. Our non-mortgage products businesses have various seasonality trends which may create further uncertainty in our quarterly operating results. See Item 1. Business-Seasonality included elsewhere in this report for more information. Any of these seasonal trends, or the combination of them, may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile the conditional conversion feature of the 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2022 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Because of the trading price of our common stock during the measurement period applicable to the quarter ended December 31, 2018, holders of the Notes are not entitled to convert the Notes during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2019. Convertibility for each quarter thereafter will be determined based on whether the last reported sales price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price under the Notes on each applicable trading day. If so, then the Notes will be convertible during that calendar quarter. The Notes will also be convertible at any time during the five business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading Day of such five trading day period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock on each such trading day and the conversion ratio under the Notes, as more fully described in the indenture governing the Notes, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report.\nIf one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefore, or pay cash with respect to Notes being converted if we elect not to issue shares, which could harm our reputation and affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain counterparties. The hedge transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with such counterparties. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. The initial strike price of the warrants is $266.39.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the hedge and warrant transactions, the counterparties or their respective affiliates may have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nWe may still incur substantially more debt in the future or take other actions which would intensify the risks associated with our debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. Our existing credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 92775, "SIC": 6163, "TIC": "TREE"}
