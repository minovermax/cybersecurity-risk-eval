{"cik": "865752", "company": "Monster Beverage Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nFollowing the TCCC Transaction, NewCo and TCCC will have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, NewCo\u2019s future performance is expected to substantially depend on the success of its relationship with TCCC.\nIn connection with the TCCC Transaction, the amended distribution coordination agreements to be entered into with TCCC will provide for the transition of third parties\u2019 rights to distribute the Company\u2019s products in most territories in the U.S. to members of TCCC\u2019s distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling/distribution partners. On February 9, 2015 in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable third-party distributors, the Company sent notices of termination to certain affected third-party distributors, including the majority of the AB Distributors in the U.S., providing for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights will be transferred to TCCC\u2019s distribution network in each applicable territory as of the effective date of the termination of the applicable third party\u2019s rights in such territory. In addition, it is expected that TCCC will become our preferred distribution partner globally. As a result, we will be reducing our distributor diversification and will be substantially dependent on TCCC\u2019s international distribution platform.\nAlso in connection with the TCCC Transaction, TCCC will make a substantial equity investment in NewCo and has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category. While we believe that this will incentivize TCCC to take steps to assure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the TCCC distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as TCCC is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. In addition, TCCC does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with TCCC\u2019s interests. Moreover, it is also possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of TCCC\u2019s priorities or the priorities of the members of TCCC\u2019s distribution system. In any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of NewCo\u2019s common shares could be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the TCCC Transaction, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete with TCCC in the non-energy drink category following the closing. As a result, our sole focus will be in the energy drink category and our business will become more vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nThe failure to transition the distribution of our products to TCCC\u2019s distribution network in a timely manner could reduce and/or delay the expected benefits of the TCCC Transaction.\nIf the expected transition of the U.S. distribution rights to TCCC\u2019s distribution network described above is not completed in a full, timely and/or efficient manner, the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements could be reduced and/or delayed. In this regard, we have been informed that approximately 64 AB Distributors are challenging our right to terminate their distribution agreements in accordance with the express terms of such distribution agreements. We have filed separate arbitration demands against each of these parties seeking declarations of our rights, including our right to terminate the applicable distribution agreements in accordance with their terms. We have also filed an action in the United States District Court, Central District of California, against these parties to enforce each of their respective obligations to arbitrate any disputes arising under such distribution agreements. We believe the independent distributors\u2019 allegations are without merit.\nWe expect to incur costs associated with transition of distribution which we currently estimate at $280.0 million. The final amount of those costs could be different and such differences could be material. In addition, under the TCCC Transaction Agreements, up to $625.0 million of the net $2.15 billion cash payment to be paid to us by TCCC will be held in escrow, subject to release upon achievement of milestones relating to the transition of distribution rights to TCCC\u2019s distribution network. A failure to meet those milestones would result in a decrease in, and/or delay of, the cash payment.\nFollowing the TCCC Transaction, TCCC will be a significant shareholder of NewCo and may have interests that are different from NewCo\u2019s other shareholders (including current shareholders of the Company).\nIn connection with the TCCC Transaction, each outstanding share of the Company\u2019s common stock will be converted into one share of NewCo\u2019s common stock. Immediately following the consummation of the TCCC Transaction, TCCC will own NewCo common shares representing approximately 16.7% of the total number of NewCo\u2019s outstanding common shares. TCCC will also have the right to nominate two directors to the NewCo board of directors, subject to reduction in certain circumstances.\nFollowing the completion of the TCCC Transaction, TCCC\u2019s ownership could also have an effect on NewCo\u2019s ability to engage in a change in control transaction. TCCC will be obligated for a period of time to vote all of its NewCo common shares in excess of 20% of the outstanding NewCo common shares in the same proportion as all NewCo common shares not owned by TCCC with respect to a proposal for a NewCo change of control. However, if TCCC were to oppose such a change in control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of NewCo\u2019s common shares not owned by TCCC (assuming that TCCC increased its ownership from approximately 16.7% to 20% of NewCo\u2019s common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of NewCo\u2019s outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. In addition, assuming the completion of the TCCC Transaction, TCCC would have a bidding advantage if the NewCo board of directors were to seek to sell NewCo in the future because TCCC would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time, including the shares it acquires in the TCCC Transaction. TCCC and NewCo would also be permitted to terminate TCCC\u2019s distribution coordination agreements with NewCo after a change in control of NewCo. In such event, TCCC would receive a termination fee if TCCC terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of NewCo involving certain TCCC competitors, or if NewCo terminated following a change in control of NewCo, involving any third party.\nThe interests of TCCC may be different from or conflict with the interests of NewCo\u2019s other shareholders (including current shareholders of the Company, who will receive NewCo common shares in the TCCC Transaction) and, as a result, TCCC\u2019s influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of NewCo, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to NewCo\u2019s other shareholders. Moreover, TCCC\u2019s ownership of a significant amount of NewCo\u2019s outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of NewCo\u2019s common shares if TCCC were to sell a large portion of its shares or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur.\nThe TCCC Transaction may not be completed or may be delayed, and even if the TCCC Transaction is successfully completed, the anticipated benefits to the Company\u2019s stockholders may not be realized.\nThe completion of the TCCC Transaction is subject to certain customary conditions. The Company or TCCC may be unable to satisfy the conditions required to complete the transaction, and there is no assurance that the TCCC Transaction will be completed on a timely basis or at all. If the TCCC Transaction is not completed, we will nonetheless bear significant transaction costs. In addition, the current market price of our stock may reflect an assumption that the TCCC Transaction will occur, and failure to complete the TCCC Transaction could result in a decline in our stock price. The failure of the TCCC Transaction to be completed may also result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of the Company in the investment community and may affect our relationship with customers and other partners.\nChanges in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size, or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. For a discussion of certain of such legislation, see \u201cPart I, Item 1 - Business - Government Regulation.\u201d Furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. To the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for or availability of our energy drinks and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the FFDC Act, including as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled and/or reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general and/or other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products.\nWe are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. In July 2012, we received a subpoena from a state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our Monster Energy\u00ae brand energy drinks. We cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLitigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products.\nIn 2012, we were named as a defendant in a product liability lawsuit, which alleged that the consumption of two 24-ounce cans of Monster Energy\u00ae over the course of two days, caused the wrongful death of a fourteen year old girl (Anais Fournier) in December 2011. We do not believe that our products are responsible for the death of Ms. Fournier and intend to continue to vigorously defend the lawsuit. In addition, additional product liability lawsuits have since been filed against us, containing similar allegations to those presented in the Fournier lawsuit, each of which we believe is also without merit and would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the event any damages were awarded.\nIn October 2012, we received a written request for information from the City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco (the \u201cCity Attorney\u201d) concerning our advertising and marketing of our Monster Energy\u00ae brand of energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of our products for consumption by adolescents. In a subsequent letter, the City Attorney threatened to bring suit against us if we did not agree to take certain steps immediately and, on May 6, 2013, the City Attorney filed a complaint against us for declaratory and injunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution for an alleged violation of California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law. We deny that we have violated the Unfair Competition Law or any other law and believe that the City Attorney\u2019s claims and demands are preempted and unconstitutional. We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit. At this time, no evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of potential loss can be expressed.\nSeveral other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading in nature and/or that our products are not safe. Putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or that our products are in any way unsafe and intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits.\nAny of the foregoing matters or other product-related litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation, could consume significant financial and managerial resources, and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation.\nCriticism of our energy drink products, and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us.\nAn unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content in our products or energy drinks generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and/or indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. We believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the U.S. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine) and/or the levels thereof and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. If reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, they could adversely affect the demand for our products.\nIncreased competition could hurt our business.\nThe beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.\nImportant factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Red Bull Gmbh, the DPS Group, Kraft Foods Inc., Suntory Holdings, Ltd., Nestle Beverage Company, Tree Top and Ocean Spray. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains, and club stores.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues or market share or position due to competition in the beverage industry. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nGlobal economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. In addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets, or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the United States has increased our exposure to any developments or crisis in European and other international markets. If economic conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.\nThe beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. This may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which we do not use in our beverages.\nConsumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and health, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some beverage brands and/or products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers\u2019 preferences change. The beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOperations outside the United States expose us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets.\nOur gross sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 23%, 23% and 22% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business. If we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. In many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. Our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the U.S. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including: economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.\nGlobal or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business.\nBecause of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. Such events could impact the production and distribution of our products. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. If we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. We have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time.\nWe derive a substantial portion of revenues from our energy drinks and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nA substantial portion of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including in particular our Monster Energy\u00ae brand energy drinks. Our DSD segment, which is comprised primarily of energy drinks, represented 96.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Any decrease in the sales of our Monster Energy\u00ae brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. Domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with Red Bull, Rockstar, Full Throttle, No Fear, Amp, Adrenaline Rush, NOS, Venom, Redline, Red Devil, Xenergy, MiO Energy, Rip It, Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks Double Shot Energy Plus Coffee, Rockstar Roasted, 5-Hour Energy Shots, Stacker 2, VPX Redline Energy Shots and many other brands. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in different packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles, including Sobe, Sobe Life Water, Snapple, Arizona, Fuse, Ocean Spray, Honest Tea, Gold Peak Tea, Activate, Neuro and Vitamin Water, have added dietary ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as \u201cfunctional\u201d or energy beverages or as having \u201cfunctional\u201d benefits. In addition, certain large companies such as TCCC and PepsiCo, market and/or distribute products in that market segment such as Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew MDX, Mountain Dew Kickstart and Vault. Internationally, our energy drinks compete with Red Bull, Rockstar, Burn, V-Energy, Lucozade, Adrenaline Rush, Relentless and numerous local and private label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as Play, Power Play, Mother, Hell, Shock, Tiger, Boost, Speed, TNT, Shark, Hot 6, Shark Energy, Nalu, Battery, Bullit, Flash Up, Black, Non-Stop, Bomba, Semtex, Vive 100, Dark Dog, Speed, Guaran\u00e1, Ultra, Sting and a host of other international brands. Our Java Monster\u00ae product line competes directly with Starbucks Frappuccino, Starbucks Double Shot, Starbucks Double Shot Energy Plus Coffee and other Starbucks coffee drinks, Rockstar Roasted, Seattle\u2019s Best and illy issimo coffee drinks. Our Muscle Monster\u00ae product line competes directly with Muscle Milk, Core Power, ABB Pure Pro and Gatorade Recover Protein Shake. Competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues and/or we could experience price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.\nWe do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to bottlers and other contract packers. In the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. In addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our Monster Energy\u00ae brand energy drinks, our Peace Tea\u00ae product line, our Hansen\u2019s\u00ae brand energy drinks, our aseptic juice products, our Hubert\u2019s\u00ae Lemonades, our Muscle Monster\u00ae product line, our Java Monster\u00ae product line and certain of our other products. While we believe a short-term disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenue, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any of such products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the United States and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates, and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all.\nWe rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our DSD segment products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer.\nMany of our bottlers and distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including energy drinks. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products.\nThe TCCC North American Bottlers, New CCE, Coca-Cola Hellenic and the AB Distributors are our primary domestic and international distributors of our Monster Energy\u00ae products. However, in February 2015, in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable third-party distributors, the Company sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the U.S. for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights will be transitioned to TCCC\u2019s network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling and distribution partners as of the effective date of termination of the AB Distributors\u2019 rights in the applicable territories (see Note 8 \u201cDistribution Agreements\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements). As a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the TCCC North American Bottlers and/or New CCE and/or Coca-Cola Hellenic, or if the TCCC North American Bottlers and/or New CCE and/or Coca-Cola Hellenic do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our Monster Energy\u00ae products could be adversely affected.\nWe continually seek to expand and/or improve the distribution of our products by entering into agreements with regional bottlers and/or other direct store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations.\nThe marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If our DSD segment brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors and/or if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key flavor suppliers. If we are unable to source our flavors on acceptable terms from our key suppliers, we could suffer disruptions in our business.\nGenerally, flavor suppliers hold the proprietary rights to their flavors. Consequently, we do not have the list of flavor ingredients or formulae for our flavors and certain of our concentrates readily available to us and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. If we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver products to our customers and/or a reduction in demand for our products containing replacement flavors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.\nUnilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.\nCCR accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales for both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. A decision by CCR, CCRC, New CCE, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam\u2019s Club), Coca-Cola Hellenic, or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business.\nThe principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, PET plastic bottles, as well as flavors, juice concentrates, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials; the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. In addition, certain of our co-pack arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. We are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, apple juice, sugar and sucralose.\nIn addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.\nOur failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, PET plastic bottles, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein, packaging materials or co-packing arrangements, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels and/or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers\u2019 or retailers\u2019 inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers.\nMany of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans, resin for PET plastic bottles, and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. These changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. In some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. In other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. We do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. If the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. We also own the copyright in and to a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. We regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. However, there can be no assurance that other third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. If we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. There can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 brand image and on consumer preference and demand. Product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, real or imagined, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media, internet or elsewhere, studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors, as well as proposed or new legislation affecting our industry.\nIf we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses.\nWe may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially not compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. Product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. We do not maintain recall insurance.\nIf we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements.\nOur business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. The loss of services of either Mr. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Schlosberg, President and Chief Financial Officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nClimate change may negatively affect our business.\nThere is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. While warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary ingredients used in our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could\nalso impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary ingredients or impact demand for our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nPotential changes in accounting practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products\u2019 affordability and reduce our sales.\nVolatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities.\nOur stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. We do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. We may be unable to achieve analysts\u2019 net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any projected levels or mixes of product sales and/or revenues and/or gross margins and/or operating profits and/or net income. As a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, our stock price high was $113.50 and our stock price low was $63.00.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.\nOur organizational documents may limit changes in control. Furthermore, as of February 17, 2015, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock. Consequently, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.\nOur cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long term goals.\nAlthough we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. In addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth.\nOur investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $370.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $781.1 million in short-term investments and $42.9 million of long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in our Company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.\u201d If we fail to do so, our business, results of operations, financial condition or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.\nLitigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.\nWe are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. Material legal proceedings are described more fully in \u201cPart I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and in \u201cPart II, Item 8, Note 10\u201d to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K.\nDefending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems.\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including cybersecurity attacks. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. However,\ngiven the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. Moreover, if our data management systems, including our SAP enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.", "PERMNO": 88031, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "MNST"}
