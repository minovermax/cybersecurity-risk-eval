{"cik": "1013880", "company": "TTEC Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section when evaluating our business. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations (including revenue, profitability and cash flows) could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline.\nIf we are unsuccessful in implementing our business strategy, our long-term financial prospects could be adversely affected\nOur growth strategy is based on continuous diversification of our business beyond contact center customer care outsourcing to an integrated customer experience platform that unites innovative and disruptive technologies, strategic consulting, data analytics, client growth solutions, and customer experience focused system design and integration. These investments in technologies and integrated solution development, however, may not lead to increased revenue and profitability. If we are not successful in creating value from these investments, there could be a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur markets are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively\nThe markets where we offer our services are highly competitive. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in markets we currently serve, while expanding into new, profitable markets. We compete with large multinational service providers; offshore service providers from lower-cost jurisdictions that offer similar services, often at highly competitive prices and aggressive contract terms; niche solution providers that compete with us in specific geographic markets, industry segments or service areas; companies that utilize new, potentially disruptive technologies or delivery models, including artificial intelligence powered solutions; and in-house functions of large companies that use their own resources, rather than outsourcing the customer care and customer experience services we provide. Some of our competitors have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete.\nFurther, the continuing trend of consolidation among business process outsourcing competitors in various geographies where we have operations may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, better technologies, or price efficiencies that may be attractive to our clients. If we are unable to compete successfully and provide our clients with superior service and solutions at competitive prices, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially affected if we cannot adapt our service offerings to changes in technology and customer expectations\nOur growth and profitability will depend on our ability to develop and adopt new technologies that expand our existing offerings by leveraging new technological trends and cost efficiencies in our operations, while meeting rapidly evolving client expectations. As technology evolves, more tasks currently performed by our agents may be replaced by automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, chatbots and other technological advances, which puts our lower-skill tier one customer care offerings at risk. These technology innovations could potentially reduce our business volumes and related revenues, unless we are successful in adapting and deploying them profitably.\nWe may not be successful in anticipating or responding to our client expectations and interests in adopting evolving technology solutions, and their integration in our offerings may not achieve the intended enhancements or cost reductions. Services and technologies offered by our competitors may make our service offerings not competitive or even obsolete and may negatively impact our clients\u2019 interest in our offerings. Our failure to innovate, maintain technological advantages, or respond effectively and timely to transformational changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe current trend to outsource customer care may not continue and the prices that clients are willing to pay for the services may diminish, adversely affecting our business\nOur growth depends, in large part, on the willingness of our clients and potential clients to outsource customer care and management services to companies like TTEC. There can be no assurance that the customer care outsourcing trend will continue; and our clients and potential clients may elect to perform in-house customer care and management services that they currently outsource. Reduction in demand for our services and increased competition from other providers and in-house service alternatives could create pricing pressures and excess capacity that would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks, cyber-fraud, and unauthorized information disclosure could harm our reputation, cause liability, result in service outages and losses, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our clients, customers of our clients, and our employees. While we take reasonable measures to protect the security of and unauthorized access to our systems and the privacy of personal and proprietary information that we access and store, our security controls over our systems may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of this information. Such unauthorized access or disclosure could subject us to liability under relevant law or our contracts and could harm our reputation resulting in loss of revenue and loss of business opportunities.\nIn recent years, there have been an increasing number of high-profile security breaches at companies and government agencies, and security experts have warned about the growing risks of hackers and cyber criminals launching a broad range of attacks targeting information technology systems. Our business is dependent on information technology systems. Information security breaches, computer viruses, interruption or loss of business data, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, and other cyber-attacks on any of these systems could disrupt the normal operations of our contact centers, our cloud platform offerings, and our enterprise services, impeding our ability to provide critical services to our clients.\nWe are experiencing an increase in frequency of cyber-fraud attempts, such as so-called \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks and phishing scams, which typically seek unauthorized money transfers or information disclosure. We actively train our employees to recognize these attacks and have implemented proactive risk mitigation measures to curb them. There are no assurances, however, that these attacks, which are also growing in sophistication, may not deceive our employees, resulting in a material loss.\nWhile we have taken reasonable measures to protect our systems and processes from intrusion and cyber- fraud, we cannot be certain that advances in cyber-criminal capabilities, discovery of new system vulnerabilities, and attempts to exploit such vulnerabilities will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our systems and the information that we manage and control, which could result in damage to our systems, our reputation and our profitability.\nOur need for consistent improvements in cybersecurity may force us to expend significant additional resources to respond to system disruptions and security breaches, including additional investments in repairing systems damaged by such attacks, reconfiguring and rerouting systems to reduce vulnerabilities, and resolving of legal claims that may arise from data breaches. A significant cyber security breach could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients and the loss of one or more of our clients could adversely affect our business\nWe rely on strategic, long-term relationships with large, global companies in targeted industries and certain agencies of the United States and state and local governments. As a result, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients. Our five and ten largest clients collectively represented 37% and 50% of our revenue in 2019 with no one client over 10%.\nAlthough we have multiple engagements with all of our largest clients and all contracts are unlikely to terminate at the same time, the contracts with our five largest clients expire between 2020 and 2023 and there can be no assurance that these contracts will continue to be renewed at all or be renewed on favorable terms. While our on-going sales and marketing activities aim to add new opportunities with existing and new commercial and government clients, there can be no assurances that such additional work can be secured nor that it would yield financial benefits comparable to expiring contracts. The loss of all or part of a major client\u2019s business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, if the loss of revenue was not replaced with profitable business from other clients.\nWe serve clients in industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation. If one of our clients is acquired (including by another of our clients) our business volume and revenue may materially decrease due to the termination or phase out of an existing client contract, volume discounts or other contract concessions which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also serve client industries that rely extensively on supply chain arrangements in the People\u2019s Republic of China and other parts of Asia. If these supply chain arrangements experience material disruption for any reason, including large scale virus epidemics, these clients\u2019 needs for our services may be impacted and our business volumes and revenues may materially decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we cannot recruit, hire, train, and retain qualified employees to respond to client demands, our business will be adversely affected\nOur business is labor intensive and our ability to recruit and train employees with the right skills, at the right price point, and in the timeframe required by our client commitments is critical to achieving our growth objective. We sign multi-year client contracts that are priced based on prevailing labor rates in jurisdictions where we deliver services. In the United States, however, our business is confronted with a patchwork of ever changing minimum wage, mandatory time off, and rest and meal break laws at the state and local levels. As these jurisdiction-specific laws change with little notice or grace period for transition, we often have no opportunity to adjust and change how we do business nor pass cost increases to our clients. These frequent changes in the law and inconsistencies in laws across different jurisdictions in the United States, may result in higher costs, lower contract profitability, higher turnover and reduced operational efficiencies, which could, in the aggregate, have material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for qualified personnel with multiple language capabilities and fluency in English may exceed supply. Employees with specific skills may also be required to keep pace with evolving technologies and client demands. While we invest in employee retention, we continue to experience high employee turnover and are continuously recruiting and training replacement staff. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel at costs acceptable under our contracts, our costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining employees, and the challenge of managing continuously changing and seasonal client demands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur delivery model involves geographic concentration exposing us to significant operational risks\nOur business model is dependent on our customer engagement centers and enterprise support functions being located in low cost jurisdictions around the globe. Our customer engagement delivery capacity and our back-office functions are concentrated in the United States, the Philippines, Mexico, India, and Bulgaria and our technology solutions centers are concentrated in a few locations in the United States, India and the UK. Our dependence on our customer engagement centers and enterprise support functions in the Philippines and Mexico, which is subject to frequent severe weather, natural disasters, and occasional health and security threats, represents a particular risk. Natural disasters (floods, winds, and earthquakes), terrorist attacks, pandemics, large-scale utilities outages, telecommunication and transportation disruptions, labor or political unrest, and restriction on repatriation of funds at some of these locations may interrupt or limit our ability to operate or may increase our costs. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, while extensive, may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.\nFor these and other reasons, our geographic concentration could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we procure business interruption insurance to cover some of these exposures, adequate insurance may not be available on an ongoing basis for a reasonable price.\nWe routinely consider acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions and may enter into such transactions at any time\nWe are engaged in a regular review of our strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions that we believe would provide value for our stockholders. We routinely have merger, acquisition, and divestiture opportunities in various stages of active review, and we also routinely engage consultants and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities. While at this time we are not actively engaged in negotiations regarding a material merger, acquisition or divestiture transaction, we could do so at any time. If such a transaction involves a sale of a part of the business, it would likely reduce the revenue and income of the remaining business and may impact the Company\u2019s stock price. While we consider these transactions to improve our business and financial results over time, there can be no assurance that our goals will be realized.\nOur strategy of growing through acquisitions may impact our business in unexpected ways\nOur growth strategy involves acquisitions that help us expand our service offerings and diversify our existing geographic footprint. We continuously evaluate acquisition opportunities, but there are no assurances that we will be able to identify acquisition targets that complement our strategy and are available at valuation levels accretive to our business.\nEven if we are successful in making acquisitions, the acquired businesses may subject our business to risks that may impact our results of operation; including:\n\u00b7\ninability to integrate acquired companies effectively and realize anticipated synergies and benefits from the acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of the acquired businesses at the expense of delivering results for the legacy business;\n\u00b7\ninability to appropriately scale critical resources to support the business of the expanded enterprise and other unforeseen challenges of operating the acquired business as part of TTEC\u2019s operations;\n\u00b7\ninability to retain key employees of the acquired businesses and/or inability of such key employees to be effective as part of TTEC operations;\n\u00b7\nimpact of liabilities or ethical issues of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single supplier or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition;\n\u00b7\nimpacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives; and\n\u00b7\ninternal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies may be inadequate or ineffective.\nCompliance with laws, including unexpected changes to such laws, could adversely affect our results of operations\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by the United States and foreign national, state and provincial authorities relating to confidential client and customer data, customer communications, telemarketing practices, and licensed healthcare and financial services activities, among other areas. Costs and complexity of compliance with existing and future regulations could adversely affect our profitability. If we fail to comply with regulations relevant to our business, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, monetary damages and fines. Private lawsuits and enforcement actions by regulatory agencies could also materially increase our costs of operations and impact our ability to serve our clients.\nAs we provide services to clients\u2019 customers residing in countries across the world, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as data privacy, import/export controls, communication content requirements, trade restrictions and sanctions, tariffs, taxation, labor regulations, wages and severance, health care requirements, internal and disclosure control obligations, and immigration. Violations of these laws and related regulations could impact our reputation and result in financial liability, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process information, financial penalties, and breach of our contractual commitments.\nAdverse changes in laws or regulations that impact our business may negatively affect the sale of our services, slow the growth of our operations, or mandate changes to how we deliver our services, including our ability to use offshore resources. These changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets.\nUncertainty and inconsistency in privacy and data protection laws that impact our business and high cost of compliance with such laws may impact our ability to deliver services and our results of operations\nDuring the last few years, there has been a significant increase in data protection and privacy regulations and enforcement activity in many jurisdictions where we and our clients do business. These new regulations are often complex and at times they impose conflicting requirements among different jurisdictions that we serve. For example, GDPR, adopted by the European Union in 2018, imposed new data protection requirements for controllers and processers of personally identifiable information collected in Europe, while the State of California in the United States imposed similar regulations effective 2020 with a different reach. Several other states in the United States are expected to adopt their own regulations in 2020. Failure to comply with all privacy and data protection laws that are relevant to different parts of our business may result in legal claims, significant fines, sanctions, or penalties, or may make it difficult for us to secure business or efficiently serve our clients. Compliance with these evolving regulations may require significant investment which would impact our results of operations.\nOur cloud solutions are technology vendor dependent, which may impact our ability to grow our business and our results of operations\nOur current cloud service solutions are primarily based on a single vendor technology. If this vendor does not continue to evolve the technology to stay competitive in the rapidly changing cloud computing services market, our financial results of operations could be materially impacted. There also can be no assurance that TTEC will be able to diversify its cloud service offerings quickly enough to offset any potential negative market trends for the cloud technology vendor that we are currently partnering with, and our inability to diversify may have impacts on our business and results of operations.\nOur growth of operations and geographic footprint expansion could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer\nWe plan to continue growing our business through the growth of clients\u2019 wallet share, increasing sales efforts, geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions, while maintaining tight controls on our expenses and overhead. Lean overhead functions combined with focused growth may place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources, resulting in internal control failures, missed opportunities, and staff attrition which could impact our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful\nOur ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our ability to engage in continuous management of our costs. Our cost management strategies include optimizing the alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, including our contact center utilization; the costs of service delivery; the cost of sales and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues; and the use of process automation for standard operating tasks. If we are not effective in managing our operating and administrative costs in response to changes in demand and pricing for our services, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on to our clients the increases in our costs of operations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial results depend on our capacity utilization and our ability to forecast demand and make timely decisions about staffing levels, investments, and operating expenses\nOur ability to meet our strategic growth and profitability objectives depends on how effectively we manage our customer engagement center capacity against the fluctuating and seasonal client demands. Predicting customer demand and making timely staffing level decisions, investments, and other operating expenditure commitments in each of our delivery center locations is key to our successful execution and profitability maximization. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to achieve or maintain desired delivery center capacity utilization, because quarterly variations in client volumes, many of which are outside our control, can have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates. If our utilization rates are below expectations, because of our high fixed costs of operation, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur sales cycles for new client relationships and new lines of business with existing clients can be long, which results in a long lead time before we receive revenues\nWe often face a long selling cycle to secure contracts with new clients or contracts for new lines of business with existing clients. When we are successful in securing a new engagement, it is generally followed by a long implementation period when clients must give notice to incumbent service providers or transfer in-house operations to us. There may also be a long ramp up period before we commence our services, and for certain contracts we receive no revenue until we start performing the work. If we are not successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the initial prolonged sales cycle or in maintaining the contractual relationship for a period of time necessary to offset new project investment costs and appropriate return on that investment, the investments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nContract terms typical in our industry can lead to volatility in our revenue and our margins\nOur contracts do not have guaranteed revenue levels. Most of our contracts require clients to provide monthly forecasts of volumes, but no guaranteed or minimum volume levels. Such forecasts vary from month to month, which can impact our staff utilizations, our cost structure, and our profitability.\nMany of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses with short notice periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation. Many of our contracts can be terminated for convenience and our contracts do not guarantee a minimum revenue level or profitability. If a client terminates a contract or materially reduces customer interaction volumes, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and makes it harder to make projections.\nWe may not always offset increased costs with increased fees under long-term contracts. The pricing and other terms of our client contracts, particularly on our long-term contact center agreements, are based on estimates and assumptions we make at the time we enter into these contracts. These estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services but these judgments could differ from actual results. Not all our contracts allow for escalation of fees as our cost of operations increase. Moreover, those that do allow for such escalations do not always allow increases at rates comparable to increases that we experience due to rising minimum wage costs and related payroll cost increases. If and to the extent we do not negotiate long-term contract terms that provide for fee adjustments to reflect increases in our cost of service delivery, our business, financial conditions, and results of operation could be materially impacted.\nOur pricing depends on effectiveness of our level of effort forecasts. Pricing of our services in our technology and strategic consulting businesses is contingent on our ability to accurately forecast the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services, which is data dependent and can be inaccurate. The errors in level of effort estimations could yield lower profit margins or cause projects to become unprofitable, resulting in adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdictions and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income and many of the other countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. For example, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the 2017 Tax Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could impact our recorded amounts in future periods.\nAdditional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere are no assurances that we will be able to implement effective tax planning strategies that are necessary to optimize our tax position following changes in tax laws globally. If we are unable to implement a cost effective contracting structure, our effective tax rate and our results of operations would be impacted.\nWe face special risks associated with our business outside of the United States\nAn important component of our business strategy is service delivery outside of the United States and our continuing international expansion. During 2019, we derived approximately 40% of our revenue from operations outside of the United States. Conducting business abroad is subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7\ninconsistent regulations, licensing and legal requirements may increase our cost of operations as we endeavor to comply with multiple, complex laws that differ from one country to another;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty of tax regulations in countries where we do business may affect our costs of operation;\n\u00b7\nspecial challenges in managing risks inherent in international operations, such as unique and prescriptive labor rules, corrupt business environments, restrictive immigration and export control laws may cause an inadvertent violation of laws that we may not be able to immediately detect or correct;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles could impact our cash flows and results of operations;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability and unexpected changes in regulatory regimes could adversely affect our ability to deliver services overseas and our ability to repatriate cash;\n\u00b7\nthe withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) created substantial uncertainty about the political and economic relationship between the UK and the EU, and the UK\u2019s other trading partners which could, depending on future trade term negotiations, impact our European operations and our operations in the UK;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on currency movement, and impact of international tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations, if we are forced to maintain assets in currencies other than U.S. dollars, while our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars;\n\u00b7\ninfrastructure challenges and lack of sophisticated disaster and pandemic preparedness in some countries where we do business, and\n\u00b7\nterrorist attacks or civil unrest in some of the regions where we do business (e.g. the Middle East, Latin America, the Philippines, and in Europe), and the resulting need for enhanced security measures may impact our ability to deliver services, threaten the safety of our employees, and increase our costs of operations.\nWhile we monitor and endeavor to mitigate in a timely manner the relevant regulatory, geopolitical, and other risks related to our operations outside of the United States, we cannot assess with certainty what impact such risks are likely to have over time on our business, and we can provide no assurance that we will always be able to mitigate these risks successfully and avoid adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and maintain our delivery centers in countries with stable wage rates and find new locations required by our clients\nOur business is labor-intensive and therefore cost of wages, benefits and related taxes constitute a large component of our operating expenses. As a result, expansion of our business is dependent upon our ability to maintain and expand our operations in cost-effective locations, in and outside of the United States. Most of our customer engagement centers are located in jurisdictions subject to minimum wage regulations, which may result in increased wages in the future, thus impacting our profitability.\nOur clients often dictate where they wish for us to locate the delivery centers that serve their customers, such as \u201cnear shore\u201d jurisdictions located in close proximity to the United States or specific locations elsewhere in the world. There is no assurance that we will be able to find and secure locations suitable for delivery center operations in jurisdictions which meet our cost-effectiveness and security standards. Our inability to expand our operations to such locations, however, may impact our ability to secure new and additional business from clients, and could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nIncreases in the cost of communication and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business\nOur business is significantly dependent on telephone, internet and data service provided by various domestic and foreign communication companies. Any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business. We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in complex and multi-layered redundancies, and we can transition services among our different customer engagement centers around the world. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that the redundancies we have in place would be sufficient to maintain operations without disruption.\nOur inability to obtain communication and data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our results of operations. Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short term rate increases and fluctuations. There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts may be subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control. A significant increase in the cost of communication services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our business.\nDefects or errors in software utilized in our service offerings could adversely affect our business\nThe third-party software and systems that we use to conduct our business and serve our clients are highly complex and may, from time to time, contain design defects, coding errors or other software errors that may be difficult to detect or correct, and which are outside of our control. Although our commercial agreements contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities, these provisions may not always effectively protect us against claims in all jurisdictions. As a result, problems with software and systems that we use may result in damages to our clients for which we are held responsible, causing damage to our reputation, adversely affecting our business, our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the transfer pricing arrangements we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be inappropriate, our tax liability may increase\nWe have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business, including operations, marketing, sales, and delivery functions. The United States, Australia, Mexico, Philippines and other transfer pricing regulations in other countries where we operate, require that cross-border transactions between affiliates be on arm\u2019s-length terms. We carefully consider the pricing among our subsidiaries to assure that they are at arm\u2019s-length. If tax authorities were to determine that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate, we may incur increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would cause material increase in our tax liability, thereby impacting our profitability and cash flows, and potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our operations, effective tax rate and financial condition.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur impairments to goodwill, long-lived assets or strategic investments\nAs a result of past acquisitions, as of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $301.7 million of goodwill and $115.6 million of intangible assets included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least once annually, and more often when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. In the event that the book value of goodwill or intangible asset is impaired, such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period when such impairment is determined. We have recorded goodwill and intangible impairments in the past, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future that could have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement by us and by others may adversely impact our ability to innovate and compete\nFrom time to time, we and members of our supply chain receive assertions that our service offerings or technologies infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While to date we have been successful in defending such claims and many of these claims are without basis, the claims could require us to cease activities, incur expensive licensing costs, or engage in costly litigation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property may not always receive favorable treatment from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or similar foreign intellectual property adjudication and registration agencies; and our \u201cpatent pending\u201d intellectual property may not receive a patent or may be subject to prior art limitations.\nThe lack of an effective legal system in certain countries where we do business or lack of commitment to protection of intellectual property rights, may prevent us from being able to defend our intellectual property and related technology against infringement by others, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rate risk\nMany contracts that we service from customer engagement centers based outside of the United States are typically priced, invoiced, and paid in U.S. and Australian dollars, the British pound or Euros, while the costs incurred to deliver the services and operate are incurred in the functional currencies of the applicable operating subsidiary. The fluctuations between the currencies of the contract and operating currencies present foreign currency exchange risks. Furthermore, because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, but approximately 21% of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\nWhile we hedge at various levels against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully manage this foreign currency exchange risk and avoid adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLegislation discouraging offshoring of service by United States companies or making such offshoring difficult could significantly affect our business\nA perceived association between offshore service providers and the loss of jobs in the United States has been a focus of political debate in recent years. As a result, current and prospective clients may be reluctant to hire offshore service providers like TTEC to avoid negative perceptions and regulatory scrutiny. If they seek customer care and management capacity onshore that was previously available to them through outsourcers outside of the United States, they may elect to perform these services in-house instead of outsourcing the services onshore. Possible tax incentives for United States businesses to return offshored, including outsourced and offshored, services to the United States could also impact our clients\u2019 continuing interest in using our services.\nLegislation aimed to expand protections for United States based customers from having their personal data accessible outside of the United States could also impact offshore outsourcing opportunities by requiring notice and consent as a condition for sharing personal identifiable information with service providers based outside of the United States. Any material changes in current trends among United States based clients to use services outsourced and delivered offshore would materially impact our business and results of operations.\nHealth epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results\nOur customer engagement centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location. Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the locations in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower capacity utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our customer engagement centers, transportation restrictions that could make it difficult for our employees to commute to work, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business. Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur bylaws designate Delaware courts as the exclusive forum for most disputes with our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for their disputes.\nOur bylaws designate Delaware\u2019s state courts as the exclusive forum for most disputes between us and our stockholders, including federal claims and derivative actions. We believe that this provision may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges who are particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases relative to other forums, and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. This choice of forum provision does not have the effect of causing our stockholders to waive our obligation to comply with the federal securities laws. This bylaw forum selection provision is not uncommon for companies incorporated in the State of Delaware, but it could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to select a more favorable judicial forum for disputes with us, our directors, officers or other employees and may therefore discourage litigation. It is important to note, however, that our choice of forum provision would (i) not be enforceable with respect to any suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) have uncertain enforceability with respect to claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the price of our common stock\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u00b7\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. Further, as described below, a majority of our stock is held by a single controlling stockholder, which means that a change in control of our company or the composition of the Board of Directors will not occur without the approval of the controlling stockholder.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a majority of our stock and has control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders; and his interest may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders\nKenneth D. Tuchman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, directly and beneficially owns approximately 61% of TTEC\u2019s common stock. As a result, Mr. Tuchman could and does exercise significant influence and control over our business practices and strategy. As long as Mr. Tuchman continues to beneficially own more than 50% of our common stock he will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors, effect stockholder actions by written consent in lieu of stockholder meetings, and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the occurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nThe interest of Mr. Tuchman may not always coincide with the interest of our other stockholders, and Mr. Tuchman may seek to cause the Company to take actions that might involve risks to our business or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. For example, Mr. Tuchman\u2019s control of TTEC could delay or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely, Mr. Tuchman\u2019s control could result in the consummation of a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. As a controlling stockholder, Mr. Tuchman is generally entitled to vote his shares as he sees fit, which may not always be in the interest of our other stockholders. This concentrated control could also discourage parties from acquiring our common stock or initiating potential mergers, takeovers or other change of control transactions, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, we are not required to have a majority of our Board of Directors be independent, nor are we required to have an independent compensation committee or an independent nominating committee of the Board. While the Company has elected not to avail itself of these governance exceptions available to \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d in the future the Company may elect to do so. Accordingly, because of our \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for NASDAQ-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.", "PERMNO": 83916, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "TTEC"}
