{"cik": "863894", "company": "FEMALE HEALTH CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the APP Merger or it may take longer than anticipated for the combined company to achieve those benefits.\n\ufeff\nOur realization of the benefits anticipated as a result of the APP Merger will depend in part on the integration of APP's business with that of FHC under a new management team led by our new President and Chief Executive Officer, Mitchell S. Steiner, M.D. However, we may not be able to effectively operate and integrate APP's business and FHC's business. The dedication of management resources to this integration could detract attention from the day-to-day business of FHC and APP, and FHC cannot assure shareholders that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or other negative consequences as a result of these integration efforts. These effects, including, but not limited to, incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with integration of the two businesses, or the failure of APP's business to perform as expected, could harm our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdditional financing will be needed to support our development activities.\n\ufeff\nWe expect to incur significant expenditures over the next several years to support our preclinical and clinical development activities, particularly with respect to clinical trials for our MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111 and APP-112 drug candidates and the bioequivalence study for Tamsulosin DRS. This will require us to obtain additional capital for our business, and additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our shareholders' ownership will be diluted. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf adequate funds cannot be raised, we may be required to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ndelay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs; or\n\u00b7\nrelinquish, license or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, drug candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself at an earlier stage or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available.\n\ufeff\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe size, complexity, results and timing of our development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe cost to obtain sufficient supply of the compounds necessary for our drug candidates at a reasonable cost;\n\u00b7\nthe time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in manufacturing and commercializing our drug candidates; and\n\u00b7\ncompeting technological and market developments.\n\ufeff\nThese factors could result in variations from currently projected operating and liquidity requirements.\n\ufeff\nOur business may be affected by contracting risks with government and other international health agencies.\n\ufeff\nOur customers for FC2 have primarily been large international agencies and government health agencies which purchase and distribute FC2 for use in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Sales to such agencies may be subject to government contracting risks, including the appropriations process and funding priorities, potential bureaucratic delays in awarding contracts under governmental tenders, process errors, politics or other pressures, and the risk that contracts may be subject to cancellation, delay, or restructuring. A governmental tender award indicates acceptance of the bidder\u2019s price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units. Many governmental tenders are stated to be \u201cup to\u201d the maximum number of units, which gives the applicable government agency discretion to purchase less than the full maximum tender amount. As a result, government agencies may order and purchase fewer units than the full maximum tender amount and there are no guarantees as to the timing or amount of actual orders or shipments under government tenders. Orders received may vary from the amount of the tender award based on a number of factors, including vendor supply capacity, quality inspections, and changes in demand. These contracting risks may cause significant quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results and could adversely affect our net revenues and profitability. Budget issues, spending cuts, and global health spending priorities affecting government health agencies may also adversely affect demand for FC2 and our net revenues.\n\ufeff\nWe will experience intense competition.\n\ufeff\nWe are engaged in the marketing and development of products in industries, including the pharmaceutical industry, that are highly competitive. The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by extensive research and rapid technological progress. Potential competitors with respect to our drug candidates in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we have. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures could have a negative effect on our net revenues and profit margins.\n\ufeff\nOther parties have developed and marketed female condoms, although only three such products have WHO pre-clearance and none of these female condoms have been approved for market by the FDA. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S., and WHO pre-clearance is required to sell female condoms to U.N. agencies. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification. We have experienced increasing competition in the global public sector, and competitors received part of the last two South African tenders. Increasing competition in FC2\u2019s markets may put pressure on pricing for FC2 or adversely affect sales of FC2, and some customers, particularly in the global public sector, may prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. It is also possible that other companies will develop a female condom, and such companies could have greater financial resources and customer contacts than us. In addition, other contraceptive methods may compete with FC2 for funding and attention in the global public sector.\n\ufeff\nAn inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could adversely affect our future growth.\n\ufeff\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions of new products, technologies, and/or businesses that enable us to leverage our competitive strengths. While we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions where required, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. An inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could limit our future growth.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nThe integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may experience losses that could adversely affect our profitability;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses;\n\u00b7\npossible failure to accomplish the strategic objectives for an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in achieving planned cost-savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may require significant expenditures for product development or regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may lack adequate internal controls or have other issues with its financial systems;\n\u00b7\nthere may be regulatory compliance or other issues relating to the business practices of an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges and we may also incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, we may borrow funds or issue equity to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions could adversely affect our operating margins and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Equity issuances may dilute our existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our shares.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on four major customers for a significant portion of our net revenues.\n\ufeff\nThe Company's four largest customers currently are UNFPA, USAID, Sekunjalo and Semina. UNFPA accounted for 25 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016, 18 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015, and 40 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014. USAID accounted for 24 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016, 16 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015, and 17 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014. Sekunjalo accounted for less than 10 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016 and 2015 and 13 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014. Semina accounted for 27 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2016, 47 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015, and less than 10 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014. An adverse change in our relationship with our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability. In addition, we may have a concentration of accounts receivable with one or more of our largest customers, and a delay in payment by a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nSince we sell product in foreign markets, we are subject to international business risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nOur international operations subject us to risks, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\neconomic and political instability;\n\u00b7\nchanges in international regulatory requirements, import duties, or export restrictions, including limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ncomplications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws;\n\u00b7\nprice controls and other restrictions on foreign currency; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\n\ufeff\nAny of these risks might disrupt the supply of our products, increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues. The cost of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws increases our expenses, and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials, labor, and other costs used to manufacture FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience increased costs of raw materials, including the nitrile polymer used in FC2, and increased labor costs. We may not be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers. As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor or other costs associated with manufacturing FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses.\n\ufeff\nBecause we manufacture FC2 in a leased facility located in Malaysia, a portion of our operating costs are denominated in a foreign currency. While a material portion of our future sales of FC2 are likely to be in foreign markets, all sales of FC2 are denominated in U.S. dollars. Manufacturing costs are subject to normal currency risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) relative to the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency risk.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on a single facility to manufacture FC2, which subjects us to the risk of supply disruptions.\n\ufeff\nWe manufacture FC2 in a single leased facility located in Malaysia. Difficulties encountered by this facility, such as fire, accident, natural disaster, or an outbreak of a contagious disease could halt or disrupt production at the facility, delay the completion of orders, or cause the cancellation of orders. Any of these risks could increase our expenses or reduce our net revenues.\n\ufeff\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions may negatively affect our business.\n\ufeff\nIf general economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets in which we operate decline, or if consumers fear that economic conditions will decline, consumers may reduce expenditures for products such as our products. Adverse changes may occur as a result of adverse global or regional economic conditions, fluctuating oil prices, declining consumer confidence, unemployment, fluctuations in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our products, increase the cost, and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with producing and distributing our products. In addition, a substantial portion of the sales of FC2 are made in the public market to government agencies, including USAID and other government agencies around the world. Worsening economic conditions as well as budget deficits and austerity measures may cause pressures on government budgets and result in a reduction in purchases of FC2 by governmental agencies. Sales of FC2 fluctuate, which causes our operating results to vary from quarter-to-quarter.\n\ufeff\nSales of FC2 fluctuate based upon demand from our commercial partners and the public sector and the nature of government procurement processes. Historically, our net revenues and profitability have varied from quarter-to-quarter due to such buying patterns. Quarterly variations in operating results may cause us to fail to meet our earnings guidance or market expectations for our operating results and may tend to depress our stock price during such quarters.\n\ufeff\nMaterial adverse or unforeseen legal judgments, fines, penalties, or settlements could have an adverse impact on our profits and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may, from time to time, become a party to legal proceedings incidental to our business, including, but not limited to, alleged claims relating to product liability, environmental compliance, patent infringement, commercial disputes, and employment matters. The current and future use of our drug candidates by us and potential collaborators in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products in the future, may expose us to product liability claims. We will face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the clinical testing of our drug candidates, and will face an even greater risk if we obtain FDA approval and commercialize our drug candidates in the U.S. or other additional jurisdictions or if we engage in the clinical testing of proposed new products or commercialize any additional products. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourself against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our existing products or drug candidates, if approved. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in any of the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty recruiting subjects for clinical trials or withdrawal of these subjects before a trial is completed;\n\u00b7\nlabeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls or withdrawals;\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our products or products that we may develop in the future;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\ninjury to reputation;\n\u00b7\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; and\n\u00b7\na decline in the value of our shares.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLitigation could require us to record reserves or make payments which could adversely affect our profits and cash flows. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs, may divert management's attention and resources away from our business, may prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and may substantially increase the costs of commercializing our future products and impair the ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our strategic alliance partners.\n\ufeff\nWe currently maintain limited general commercial liability insurance coverage. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or for liabilities in excess of our insurance limits, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the APP Merger, two putative class action and derivative lawsuits were filed against us and our directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty and/or wasting of corporate assets. These lawsuits are currently in a very early stage. Any unfavorable outcomes in these lawsuits, resulting in the payment of damages or affecting our transaction with APP, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects and could reduce our profitability. In addition, addressing these lawsuits will likely divert management's attention and resources from our business.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to the Regulation and Commercialization of Our Products and Drug Candidates\n\ufeff\nThe Company has no experience in obtaining regulatory approval for a drug.\n\ufeff\nAlthough our President and Chief Executive Officer has experience in obtaining regulatory approval for a drug under development, the Company has never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, a drug. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept any or all of our planned NDAs for substantive review or may conclude, after review of our data, that our applications are insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. The FDA may also require that we conduct additional clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly and time-consuming, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available or can secure. Any delay or inability in obtaining regulatory approvals would delay or prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates, generating revenue from these proposed products and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA we submit. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our planned NDAs for one or more of our drug candidates, which would materially adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Clinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete and have highly uncertain outcomes. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our future clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. If clinical trials for any of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe could experience delays in our planned clinical trials.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials that will be required to be conducted for our drug candidates. Our planned clinical trials might not begin on time; may be interrupted, delayed, suspended, or terminated once commenced; might need to be redesigned; might not enroll a sufficient number of patients; or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold because of safety or efficacy concerns by the FDA, a DSMB, a clinical trial site's IRB or us;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u00b7\ndelays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u00b7\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredients; or\n\u00b7\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of DSMB for a trial.\n\ufeff\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue as to the affected drug candidate.\n\ufeff\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or discontinued.\n\ufeff\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111 and APP-112 drug candidates, we are required to complete preclinical development with respect to such product candidates and/or extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. To date, regulatory approval has not been obtained for any of our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nUnfavorable results from preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated. In addition, we may report top-line data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data. Such top-line data may be subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the applicable clinical trial. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to our MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111 or APP-112 drug candidates, or any other potential future drug candidate fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of that drug candidate. If we delay or abandon our development efforts related to any of the MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111 or APP-112 drug candidates, or any other potential future drug candidate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA or other regulatory authorities because of a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any proposed product that we develop, the commercial prospects of such proposed product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these proposed products will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to risks relating to collaboration with third parties.\n\ufeff\nAs part of our business strategy, we may enter into collaboration arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize our drug candidates. For our collaboration efforts to be successful, we must identify partners whose competencies complement our competencies. We may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements. Also, we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources and capabilities of these collaborators with our own. In addition, we may face a disadvantage in seeking to enter into or negotiating collaborations with potential partners because other potential collaborators may have greater management and financial resources than we do. Our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than originally expected. If we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts, our ability to develop and market drug candidates could be severely limited.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe intend to rely on CROs to conduct our research and development activities.\n\ufeff\nWe will not have the resources to independently conduct research and development activities. Therefore, we intend to rely on CROs and universities to conduct research and development activities for our drug candidates and for the execution of our clinical studies. Although we will control only certain aspects of our CROs' activities, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We cannot be sure that the CROs will conduct the research properly or in a timely manner, or that the results will be reproducible. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA's cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our drug products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable or invalid and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our drug candidates. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness compared to placebo of our drug candidates to a statistically significant degree, our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Any clinical trial that a CRO conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we will not employ the personnel of our CROs, and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such organizations, we cannot control whether or not they will devote sufficient time and resources to our research and development and our clinical studies. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including one or more of our competitors, for which they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised because of the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates that we seeks to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue from such drug candidates could be delayed or ended.\n\ufeff\nIf any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially affect our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and can increase our costs significantly. We may encounter challenges or delays in entering into or maintaining these relationships, and any such delays or challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe expect to rely on third party manufacturers for our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to rely on third-party manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of any future drug candidates for use in our clinical trials. These drug candidates are complicated and expensive to manufacture. If our future third-party manufacturers fail to deliver our drug candidates for clinical use on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our drug candidates. While we may be able to identify replacement third-party manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for these drug candidates, this process would likely cause a delay in the availability of our drug candidates and an increase in costs. In addition, third-party manufacturers may have a limited number of facilities in which our drug candidates can be produced, and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available drug candidates.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, regulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our drug candidates. Third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA's cGMPs. As a result, the facilities used by any of future manufacturers of our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA. Holders of NDAs, or other forms of FDA approvals or clearances, or those distributing a regulated product under their own name, are responsible for manufacturing even though that manufacturing is conducted by a third-party contract manufacturing organization (CMO). Our third-party manufacturers will be required to produce our drug candidates under FDA cGMPs in order to meet acceptable standards for our clinical trials. Our third-party manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to gain approval for or commercialize our drug candidates. In addition, our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMPs could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply, recalls, withdrawals, issuance of safety alerts and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, we also could experience manufacturing delays if our CMOs give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of their agreements with us.\n\ufeff\nIf any supplier of the product for our drug candidates experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time, energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our drug candidates, which could impair our ability to supply our drug candidates at the levels required for our clinical trials and commercialization and prevent or delay their successful development and commercialization.\n\ufeff\nChanges in law, including as a result of the recent presidential and congressional elections, could have a negative impact on the approval of our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements resulting from the adoption of new legislation, regulations or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly and adversely affect the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials for our drug candidates. In addition, the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be issued that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, or impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. The recent presidential and congressional elections in the U.S. could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care industry. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, specific proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability would be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe may fail to commercialize our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot be sure that, if our clinical trials for any of our MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111 or APP-112 drug candidates are successfully completed, we will be able to submit an NDA to the FDA or that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all. We also cannot be sure that, if our bioequivalence study for Tamsulosin DRS is successfully completed, any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA in a timely manner, if at all. After completing clinical trials for a drug candidate in humans, a drug dossier is prepared and submitted to the FDA as an NDA, and includes all preclinical studies and clinical trial data relevant to the safety and effectiveness of the product at the suggested dose and duration of use for the proposed indication as well as manufacturing information, in order to allow the FDA to review such drug dossier and to consider a drug candidate for approval for commercialization in the United States. If we are unable to submit an NDA with respect to any of the MSS-722, APP- 944, APP-111, APP-112 or Tamsulosin DRS, or if any NDA we submit is not approved by the FDA, we will be unable to commercialize that product. The FDA can and does reject NDAs and require additional clinical trials, even when drug candidates achieve favorable results in Phase 3 clinical trials. If we fail to commercialize any of the MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111 or APP-112 drug candidates, or Tamsulosin DRS, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are subject to extensive and costly governmental regulation.\n\ufeff\nOur products, including FC2 and our drug candidates, are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation, including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including its Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to the extent our products are paid for directly or indirectly by those departments, state and local governments and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products and medical devices under various regulatory provisions. Any of our products that are tested or marketed abroad are also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\n\ufeff\nGovernment regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing and selling products. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in, by way of example, significant fines, criminal and civil liability, product seizures, recalls, withdrawals, withdrawals of approvals and exclusion and debarment from government programs. Any of these actions, including the inability of our products to obtain and maintain regulatory approval, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to additional health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under government health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act that prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.\n\ufeff\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to change in the current environment of health care reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any changes in these laws. Federal or state regulatory authorities may challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming.\n\ufeff\nWe could experience misconduct by our employees.\n\ufeff\nWe will be exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to comply with the FCPA, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available for our products.\n\ufeff\nMarket acceptance and sales for MSS-722, APP-944, APP-111, APP-112 and Tamsulosin DRS, if approved, will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for our drug candidates, if approved. We also cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available, if any, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to gain and retain market acceptance for our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nPhysicians may not prescribe our drug candidates, if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, which would prevent any such drug candidate from generating revenue. Market acceptance of our drug candidates, by physicians, patients and payors, will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which our drug candidates are approved, if at all;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our products in the treatment of the symptoms for which they are intended;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive drugs;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product's FDA-approved labeling; and\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects.\n\ufeff\nEven if the medical community accepts that our drug candidates are safe and efficacious for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to the use or may be slow to adopt such products as an accepted treatment for the symptoms for which they are intended. We cannot be sure that any labeling approved by the FDA will permit us to promote our products as being superior to competing products. If our drug candidates, if approved, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient or any revenue from these products. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, even if our drug candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nnew products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen complications arise with respect to use of our products; or\n\u00b7\nsufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement does not remain available.\n\ufeff\nIn many foreign markets, including the countries in the European Union, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing controls. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n\ufeff\nThird parties may obtain FDA regulatory exclusivity to our detriment.\n\ufeff\nWe plan to seek to obtain market exclusivity for our drug candidates and any other drug candidates we develop in the future. To the extent that patent protection is not available or has expired, FDA marketing exclusivity may be the only available form of exclusivity available for these proposed products. Marketing exclusivity can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. Potentially competitive products may also be seeking marketing exclusivity and may be in various stages of development, including some more advanced than our products. We cannot predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval or whether FDA approval will be granted, nor can we predict with certainty the timing of FDA approval for competing products or whether such approval will be granted. It is possible that competing products may obtain FDA approval with marketing exclusivity before we do, which could delay our ability to submit a marketing application or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, result in lost market opportunities with respect to our drug candidates and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property covering our products.\n\ufeff\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our drug candidates and other products. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical products are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot be certain that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the United States, such as the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings that may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\n\ufeff\nThese risks include the possibility of the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe patent applications that we have filed may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged or discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient, incomplete or incorrect information, and thus held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u00b7\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u00b7\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were not the first inventors to file patent applications for these technologies in the United States or were not the first to file patent applications directed to these technologies abroad;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u00b7\nfuture drug candidates may not be patentable;\n\u00b7\nothers will claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights that we hold or license;\n\u00b7\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our drug candidates under patent protection; and\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products.\n\ufeff\nWhile we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate, many third parties may already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities' applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, commercialize or market our products. In addition, if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), or foreign patent regulatory authorities to determine our rights in the technologies, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged in the courts or in post-grant proceedings at the USPTO, or in similar proceedings in foreign countries. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims.\n\ufeff\nIf we or our licensors or strategic partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our drug candidates or future drug candidates, if approved, may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, mechanisms exist in much of the world permitting some form of challenge by generic drug marketers to patents prior to, or immediately following, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as \"at risk\" launches to challenge relevant patent rights.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business also may rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, and trade secrets. If the confidentiality of this intellectual property is breached, it could adversely impact our business.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent in part on some license relationships.\n\ufeff\nWe have acquired by license technology relating to our APP-111 and APP-112 drug candidates, and might enter into additional licenses in the future. Licenses to which we are a party contain, and we expect that any future licenses will contain, provisions requiring up-front, milestone and royalty payments to licensors. If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to a licensor, that licensor might have the right to terminate the license on relatively short notice, in which event we would not be able to commercialize the drug candidates that were covered by the license. Also, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe have continuing obligations under our purchase agreement to acquire the patent rights with respect to Tamsulosin DRS and granted a lien on those assets in connection with such acquisition.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to an upfront payment that we made in connection with the acquisition of the patent rights associated with Tamsulosin DRS, there are significant installment payments and milestone payments that are required to be made pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. In addition, we granted a security interest in the purchased assets to the seller to secure our present and future payment and performance obligations under the purchase agreement. Accordingly, there will be significant payments that we will be required to make in the future to the seller of the Tamsulosin DRS assets and the failure to make such payments may result in us losing our rights to such intellectual property. If we fail to retain such rights, we would not be able to commercialize any products relating to Tamsulosin DRS. In such event, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe may face claims that our intellectual property infringes on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends, in part, on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any license, collaboration or other agreements we enter into with regard to our technologies and products. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in, and for the therapeutic targets for, which we intend to develop drugs. Patent applications are confidential when filed and remain confidential until publication, approximately 18 months after initial filing, while some patent applications remain unpublished until issuance. As such, there may be other third-party patents and pending applications of which we will be unaware with claims directed towards composition of matter, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or drug candidates. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty the nature or existence of every third-party patent filing. We cannot be sure that us or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our drug candidates as planned or that us or our licensors' and partners' patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties. If any third-party patent was held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of any of our drug candidates, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. We may not be able to obtain a license to such patent on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain such license may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\ufeff\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time-consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital and divert management's attention from our business;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor's patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u00b7\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; or\n\u00b7\nredesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our strategic partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nchallenges by third parties relating to our drug candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our drug candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe must submit patent certifications in connection with the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway.\n\ufeff\nWe intend to submit NDAs for our MSS-722 and APP-944 drug candidates, assuming that the clinical data justify submission, and for our Tamsulosin DRS product under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA when at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA's prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to any patents for the approved product on which the application relies that are listed in the FDA's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product's listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification.\n\ufeff\nIf the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30 month period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45 day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time.\n\ufeff\nIf we cannot certify that all of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our drug candidates have expired, we will be compelled to include a Paragraph IV certification in the NDA for such drug candidate. Our inability to certify that all of the patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for approved products referenced in the NDAs for each of our drug candidates could have a serious and significant adverse effect on the timing for obtaining approval of our drug candidates.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors.\n\ufeff\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe may need to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.\n\ufeff\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights, generally.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents or one of our licensor's patents is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of ours licensors, do not cover the technology in question or on other grounds. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries in which the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States or in those countries in which we do not file national phase patent applications. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe may fail to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.\n\ufeff\nWe will rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we will enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. We cannot, however, ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached. In addition, enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets, know-how or technological advancements is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. Non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect this information. Moreover, our trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties. If any such events were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\ufeff\nA limited number of shareholders may be able to exercise substantial influence over us.\n\ufeff\nAssuming the conversion of all of the shares of Series 4 Preferred Stock into FHC Common Stock in accordance with their terms, Mitchell S. Steiner, M.D. will beneficially own approximately 14.5% of the shares of FHC Common Stock outstanding and Harry Fisch, M.D. will beneficially own approximately 14.6% of the shares of FHC Common Stock outstanding. These shareholders may have the ability to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning director elections, amendments to our Articles of Incorporation and possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions.\n\ufeff\nCharges to earnings resulting from the APP Merger may cause our operating results to suffer.\n\ufeff\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we will allocate the total purchase price of the APP Merger to APP's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their respective fair values as of the date of the APP Merger, and we will record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Management's estimates of the fair value of such assets will be based upon assumptions that they believe to be reasonable but that will be inherently uncertain. The following factors, among others, could result in material charges that would cause our financial results to be negatively impacted:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nimpairment of goodwill;\n\u00b7\ncharges for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and for stock-based compensation;\n\u00b7\naccrual of newly identified pre-merger contingent liabilities that are identified subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation; and\n\u00b7\ncharges to income to eliminate certain of FHC's pre-merger activities that duplicate those of APP or to reduce the combined company's cost structure.\n\ufeff\nAdditional costs may include costs of employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including salary increases or bonuses, accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation and severance payments, reorganization or closure of facilities, taxes and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required annually to deliver a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required annually to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for future periods as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements, and investors may therefore lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\n\ufeff\nThere are provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law, and our credit agreement that might prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to a number of provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law, and change of control agreements that may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe authority provided to our Board of Directors in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe provision under Wisconsin law that permits shareholders to act by written consent only if such consent is unanimous;\n\u00b7\nthe provision under Wisconsin law that requires for a corporation such as us, that was formed before January 1, 1973, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our voting stock to approve an amendment to our articles of incorporation, a merger submitted to a vote of our shareholders, or a sale of substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders\u2019 meetings;\n\u00b7\ncovenants in our credit agreement restricting mergers, asset sales and similar transactions and a provision in our credit agreement that triggers an event of default upon the acquisition by a person or a group of persons of beneficial ownership of 25% or more of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u00b7\nthe Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin's \"fair price\" and \"business combination\" provisions which limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances.\n\ufeff\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.\n\ufeff\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may become volatile again in the future. The trading price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nour failure to meet market expectations for our performance;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product developments, acquisitions, or financial performance;\n\u00b7\nfluctuation in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market conditions; or\n\u00b7\nother economic or external factors.\n\ufeff\nYou may be unable to sell your stock at or above your purchase price.\n\ufeff\nIf our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\n\ufeff\nIf the closing bid price of our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we may receive a letter from the staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC stating that our common stock will be delisted unless we are able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule requiring that we maintain a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00 per share. The closing bid price of our common stock was below $1.00 per share for a number of days recently, but not for 30 consecutive trading days. We cannot guarantee that our stock price will continue to trade above $1.00 per share or otherwise meet the NASDAQ listing requirements and therefore our common stock may in the future be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\n\ufeff\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur may reduce the prevailing market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. In addition, the former stockholders of APP are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of the shares they received pursuant to the APP Merger under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by existing shareholders could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 76461, "SIC": 3060, "TIC": "VERU"}
