{"cik": "1772016", "company": "BELLRING BRANDS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA substantial amount of our net sales comes from our RTD protein shakes, and a decrease in sales of our RTD protein shakes would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA substantial amount of our net sales is derived from our RTD protein shakes. Sales of our RTD protein shakes represented approximately 75% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2019. We believe that sales of our RTD protein shakes will continue to constitute a substantial amount of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be harmed by a decline in the market for our RTD protein shakes, increased competition in the market for those products, disruptions in our ability to produce those products, whether due to manufacturer inability, supply chain failures or otherwise, or our failure or inability to provide sufficient investment to support and market those products as needed to maintain or grow their competitive position or to achieve more widespread market acceptance.\nWe are currently dependent on a limited number of third party contract manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacturing of most of our products, including one manufacturer for the substantial majority of our RTD protein shakes. Our business could suffer as a result of a third party contract manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce our products for us in the quantities required, on time or to our specifications or to obtain the supplies and equipment necessary for such production.\nAll of our RTD protein shakes and most of our other products are manufactured by a limited number of independent third party contract manufacturers. For our year ended September 30, 2019, approximately 81% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from a single supplier and approximately 51% from a single facility of that manufacturer. In addition, production of the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size by our third party contract manufacturers requires packaging that we currently are sourcing from only one supplier and equipment that our third party contract manufacturers are currently sourcing from the same supplier. Although we have added additional contract manufacturers of our Premier Protein RTD shakes to our third party contract manufacturing network, our number of third party contract manufacturers is still limited and if one or more of our third party contract manufacturers is unable to meet our supply requirements, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although there are alternative suppliers if this current sole supplier can no longer supply us and our third party contract manufacturers with equipment or sufficient packaging, a change in supplier could delay the production of our RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size by our third party contract manufacturers. Also, if we experience significant increases in demand for our products, we and these third party contract manufacturers may not be able to obtain in a timely manner the equipment or packaging materials required to manufacture our products (including, in particular, the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size) and allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards. Further, we may experience operational difficulties with any of these third party contract manufacturers, such as limitations on production capacity, failure to meet our quantity requirements, increases in manufacturing costs, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. We are currently in a dispute with one of our former third party contract manufacturers, which we had expected to produce less than 10% of our RTD protein shakes for our year ended September 30, 2019, that has resulted in our termination of our agreement with them and related litigation. In addition, we rely in part on our independent third party contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of our independent third party contract manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product withdrawal or recall, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm. Additionally, our business could be adversely affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with any of these third parties, including the packaging and equipment supplier for our RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size, if any of these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties cease doing business with us or go out of business. The inability of third party contract manufacturers to ship orders in a timely manner, in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product, and we or the contract manufacturer may alternatively pay the other a mostly fixed amount rather than produce or purchase the minimum quantities. Despite the minimum volume commitments, we may nonetheless experience situations where such manufacturers are unable to fulfill their minimum volume obligations under our agreements or cannot produce sufficient amount of product to meet consumer demand. For example, due to a combination of better than expected volume growth for our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the second half of our year ended September 30, 2018 and delays in planned incremental production capacity by our third party\ncontract manufacturer network, our customer demand exceeded our available capacity and resulted in inventory below acceptable levels at September 30, 2018. These factors resulted in volume increases of our RTD protein shakes for our year ended September 30, 2019 being below growth trends experienced in our years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. If we need to replace an existing third party contract manufacturer, our products may not be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe operate in a category with strong competition.\nThe convenient nutrition category is highly competitive. We compete with other brands in the convenient nutrition category and with many nutritional food and beverage players, as well as manufacturers of private label products. Many of our competitors offer products similar to our products, or a wider range of products than we offer, and may offer their products at more competitive prices than we do. Competition in our industry is based on product quality, taste, functional benefits, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional efforts and ingredients.\nSome of our principal competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Our category also includes a number of smaller competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours and may have unique ties to retailers. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a shift in consumer preferences to competitors\u2019 products, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase our prices, including in response to cost increases. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to advertise products. If we are unable to use social media effectively to advertise our products, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain ingredients and packaging materials, the price and availability of ingredients and packaging materials, higher freight costs and higher energy costs could negatively impact profits.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide certain ingredients used in our business. The primary ingredients used in our business include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins and protein blends, and one supplier provides the majority of our milk-based protein. The supply and price of these ingredients are subject to market conditions and are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, aseptic plastic bottles, plastic jars and lids, flexible film, cartons and corrugate. We utilize a sole supplier for the aseptic packaging for our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the 11 ounce size. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of such ingredients and packaging materials, increases in demand for such items, both within our industry and in general, can result in shortages and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such items at a competitive cost. Further, the cost of ingredients and packaging materials may fluctuate widely, and we may experience shortages in certain items as a result of limited availability, increased demand, weather conditions and natural disasters, as well as other factors outside of our control. Our freight costs may increase due to factors such as limited carrier availability, increased fuel costs, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations and inflation. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. The prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our ingredient, packaging material, freight, tariff and energy costs at the time they occur, or at all.\nThe loss of key supply sources, for any reason, our inability to obtain necessary quantities of ingredients and packaging materials or changes in freight or energy costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors\u2019 costs, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nDisruption of our supply chain and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, business partners and third party contract manufacturers is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, freight carrier availability, any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, disease, fire, explosion, cyber-attacks, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products.\nChanges in weather conditions and natural disasters, such as fires, floods, droughts, frosts, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, insect infestations and plant disease, also may affect the cost and supply of commodities used as raw materials, including milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins and protein blends. Further, as we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide certain ingredients and packaging materials, and one supplier for the majority of our milk-based protein, adverse events\naffecting such suppliers may limit our ability to obtain such raw materials, or alternatives for these raw materials, at competitive prices, or at all. For example, for our year ended September 30, 2019, approximately 81% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from our largest contract manufacturer, from its three manufacturing facilities located in Riverside and Santa Ana, California and Joplin, Missouri, with approximately 51% of such supply manufactured at the Joplin, Missouri facility. In 2011, a major tornado struck Joplin, Missouri, but our supply of product from the Joplin, Missouri facility was not impacted. In addition, production of the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size by our third party contract manufacturers requires packaging that we currently are sourcing from only one supplier, and equipment that our third party contract manufacturers are currently sourcing from the same supplier. Our supply of packaging for our 11 ounce RTD protein shakes from this supplier comes primarily from its locations in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico and Denton, Texas. Competitors can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations.\nFailure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when an ingredient or packaging material is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and/or require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nConsolidation in our distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins.\nOver the past several years, our channels have undergone significant consolidations and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers are gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to these requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired customer. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like eCommerce, and our customers\u2019 responses to those changes could impact our business. Consolidation in our channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and develop and offer products to meet these preferences.\nOur consumers are constantly seeking new products and strategies to help them achieve their healthy eating and fitness goals, and our success relies heavily on our ability to continue to develop and market to our consumers and our customers new and innovative products and extensions of existing products. Consumer focus includes dietary, fitness and health and wellness trends, different nutritional aspects and health effects of foods and beverages, sourcing practices relating to ingredients and animal welfare concerns. Emerging science and theories regarding health are constantly evolving, and products or methods of eating once considered healthy may over time become disfavored by consumers or no longer be perceived as healthy. Approaches regarding healthy lifestyles also are the subject of numerous studies and publications, often with differing views and opinions, some of which may be adverse to us. In order to respond to new and evolving consumer and customer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, technological and other developments, we must constantly introduce new and innovative products into the market. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced products, and specifically, the initial sales volumes for new or enhanced products may not reach anticipated levels, we may be required to engage in extensive marketing efforts to promote such products, the costs of developing and promoting such products may exceed our expectations and such products may not perform as expected. Further, certain ingredients used in our products may become negatively perceived by consumers, resulting in decreased demand for our products or reformulation of existing products to remove such ingredients, which may negatively affect taste or other qualities. Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. Although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences or our inability to anticipate or react, or effectively introduce new products in response, to such changes could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including our products becoming unavailable to consumers, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients (whether or not valid), concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or\npromotional support. We may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending in order to maintain and increase customer and consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or to promote new products, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, an increase in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation or lead to an increase in brand awareness. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging or the food industry generally on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our products and our brands, including if we are unable to respond effectively to negative posts or comments or erroneous statements about our products on social or digital media, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online, digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. A variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products. These restrictions may limit our brand renovation, innovation and promotion plans, particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve. Negative posts or comments about us or our brands on social media or websites (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts, comments or activities could damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate. In addition, we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brands, our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill. Furthermore, third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets.\nSuccessful growth depends in part on our ability to add new customers, as well as expand the number of products sold through existing customers. This growth would include expanding the number of our products retailers offer for sale, our product placement and our ability to secure additional shelf or retail space for our products, as well as increased access to online platforms to sell our products. Shelf and retail space is limited and subject to competitive and other pressures. The expansion of our business depends on our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, customers, such as club, FDM, eCommerce, convenience and specialty customers.\nThe rapid growth of distribution channels, particularly eCommerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We also may need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. Our failure to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.\nSelling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the raw materials used to make certain of our products, particularly milk-based protein and nuts, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. We may need to recall or withdraw some or all of our products if they become adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our manufacturing or supply chain. A recall or withdrawal could result in destruction of product inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings for us or our third party contract manufacturers, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Any of these events, including a significant product liability claim against us, could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products. Although we have various insurance programs in place and may have rights to indemnification in certain situations, any of these events or a loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViolations of laws or regulations by us or our third party contract manufacturers, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nThe convenient nutrition category in which we operate is subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and\ndistribution, as well as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both inside and outside of the U.S., are subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal and state authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). In Europe, we are regulated by, among other authorities, the European Union Parliament and the Council of the European Union and the U.K.\u2019s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in other European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d) member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere in the world. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations (whether or not valid).\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. Further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, revocations of required licenses, detention, seizure, injunctions or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our products are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, resulting in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales.\nSome of our products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny different from those applicable to conventional food. It also is possible that federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any product liability claims resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. The convenient nutrition category is regulated internationally as food, dietary supplements and in some cases, drug products. There is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur recent growth has placed, and we expect that our continued growth may place, a significant demand on our management, personnel, systems and resources. Given our largely outsourced manufacturing model, as of November 1, 2019, we had approximately 400 employees. Our continued growth will require an increased investment by us in our contract manufacturing relationships, personnel, technology, facilities and financial and management systems and controls, including monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations. We will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nIf we pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, a divestiture or a joint venture.\nCompanies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve the anticipated sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Further, evaluating potential transactions, including divestitures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support the acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from day-to-day operating matters.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. The successful integration of acquisitions is complex and depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Potential\ndifficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following: employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate from employment with us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions; our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses; we may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management; we may be required to recognize impairment charges; and integration may be more costly or more time consuming and complex or less effective than anticipated. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges.\nOur corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in our business due to changes in our promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe periodically offer a variety of sales and promotional incentives to our customers and consumers, such as price discounts, consumer coupons, volume rebates, cooperative marketing programs, slotting fees and in-store displays. Our net sales and profitability are impacted by the introduction and discontinuance of such sales and promotion incentives. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. Historically, our first fiscal quarter is seasonally low for all brands, but increases throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of renewed consumer focus on healthy lifestyles entering the new calendar year, as well as significant promotional activity after the first quarter of our fiscal year. Seasonal fluctuations in our sales and EBIT margins may not be the same in the future as they have been historically. Seasonality could cause our results of operations for an interim financial period to fluctuate and not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis. If we fail to effectively manage our inventories, fluctuations in business as a result of promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe international portion of our business subjects us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions;\n\u2022\nunfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to general market and economic conditions outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and volatility;\n\u2022\nthe potential for substantial penalties and litigation related to violations of a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including food and beverage regulations, anti-corruption regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) and privacy laws and regulations (including the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation);\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable and/or changing foreign tax treaties and policies.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our principal exposure is to the Euro.\nLoss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our combined net sales. Our largest customers, Costco and Walmart and its affiliates (which includes Sam\u2019s Club), accounted for approximately 70% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through the club, FDM, eCommerce, specialty and convenience channels. The competition to supply products to these high-volume stores is intense. Currently, we do not have material long-term supply agreements with our customers, and our customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nPending and future litigation may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, third party contract manufacturers, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. There has been a recent increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the Internal Revenue Service or a court may disagree with tax positions taken by BellRing Brands, Inc. or BellRing Brands, LLC, which may result in adverse effects on our financial condition or the value of our common stock.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly affected U.S. tax law, including by changing how the U.S. imposes tax on certain types of income of corporations and by reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. It also imposed new limitations on a number of tax benefits, including deductions for business interest, use of net operating loss carry forwards, taxation of foreign income, and the foreign tax credit, among others. There can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in our stock. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) has yet to issue guidance on a number of important issues regarding the changes made by the Tax Act. In the absence of such guidance, BellRing Brands, Inc. and BellRing Brands, LLC will take positions with respect to a number of unsettled issues. There is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely our financial position and affect the value of our stock.\nOur market size and related estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nData for the convenient nutrition category is collected for most, but not all, channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow. We estimate the market size of the convenient nutrition category, including by geography, product form and consumer need state, based, in part, upon forecasts and information obtained from independent trade associations, industry publications and surveys and other independent sources, proprietary research studies and management\u2019s knowledge of the industry. While these estimates were made in good faith and are based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, they may not be accurate.\nAgricultural diseases or pests could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use, as well as the products we produce, or have produced by third party contract manufacturers, and distribute. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other U.S. or international regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we lose key personnel, are unable to hire qualified additional personnel or experience turnover of our management team.\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we lose key personnel or one or more members of our management team, or if we fail to attract new employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nIncreases in costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nWith approximately 400 employees as of November 1, 2019, our profitability may be substantially affected by costs of medical and other health and welfare benefits for these employees. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in healthcare laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase could negatively affect our profitability.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer and customer demand for our products.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In addition, distributors and retailers may seek to reduce their inventories in response to those economic conditions. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of our products. Further, during economic downturns, it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to, or continue to use, our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. Additionally, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Events affecting the credit markets also have had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S., which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance debt, sell our assets or borrow more money, if necessary. Our business also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging currency exchange rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have operations and assets in the U.S. as well as foreign jurisdictions, and a portion of our contracts and revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. We therefore must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in the financial statements. In addition, since many of our sales in foreign jurisdictions are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may effectively increase the price of our products in the currency of the jurisdiction in which the sale took place. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in the value of our net foreign currency investment, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable asset of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements and confidentiality provisions in third party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.\nWe also are subject to risks associated with protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property licensed to distributors of our products and of our trade secrets to our third party contract manufacturers. If our licensed distributors or third party contract manufacturers fail to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property, either intentionally or unintentionally, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if\nfeasible; divert management\u2019s attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and harm our future prospects.\nTechnology failures, cybersecurity incidents and corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. Our and our third party vendors\u2019 information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other security issues. Such interruptions could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently in the U.S., are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons).\nIf any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation and reputational damage from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. Although we have not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Several foreign governments, including the E.U., have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill is expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and is not amortized, but our management reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded a charge of $26.5 million for the impairment of our goodwill related to Dymatize. No impairments were recorded in the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. We could have additional impairments in the future. See further discussion of this impairment in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 5 within Active Nutrition\u2019s \u201cNotes to Combined Financial Statements\u201d contained in this report.\nWe and our third party contract manufacturers are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe and our third party contract manufacturers are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into\nthe environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes.\nFurther, certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released.\nFailure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law on us or our third party contract manufacturers. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. We cannot predict the impact that such regulation may have, or that climate change may otherwise have, on our business. Future events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims against us or our third party contract manufacturers, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring responsive action at our manufacturing facility or at the facilities of our third party contract manufacturers or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins and protein blends. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have significant debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. Upon consummation of our IPO on October 21, 2019, we had $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility has remaining borrowing capacity of $140.0 million as of October 31, 2019 (all of which would be secured when drawn).\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in consumer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity capital.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above, and we may in any event be required to maintain a minimum level of indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be\nsubstantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that may not constitute indebtedness under the documents governing our indebtedness. Post owns the share of our Class B Common Stock, which, for so long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) directly own more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, represents 67% of the total voting power of both classes of our outstanding common stock. As long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) owns more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, it will be able to control nearly all corporate actions that require a vote of the stockholders of BellRing Brands, Inc., as well as have the right under the investor rights agreement between BellRing Brands, Inc. and Post to designate a majority of the directors of BellRing Brands, Inc. In order to preserve its intended tax treatment in connection with the formation transactions that were undertaken as part of our IPO, we expect that, so long as Post has the ability to control us, Post will require that BellRing Brands, LLC maintain a minimum level of outstanding indebtedness equal to $800.0 million less the amount of undistributed taxable income of BellRing Brands, LLC and its subsidiaries allocable to Post.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and additionally could require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into, or permit to exist, contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements that may contain cross-default provisions.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring BellRing Brands, LLC to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, as measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2020.\nA default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nTo service indebtedness and fund other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nBellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s ability to pay principal and interest on its debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of BellRing Brands, LLC and its subsidiaries. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s ability to make these payments.\nIf BellRing Brands, LLC is unable to make payments or we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nsales of equity;\n\u2022\nreductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings.\nAs of October 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was $760 million. As a result, higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of October 31, 2019, each one hundred basis points change in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $8 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Certain of our variable rate debt use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. In addition, certain hedging transactions reference LIBOR as a benchmark rate in order to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. In the event LIBOR is discontinued, replaced or significantly changed, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument. This could result in different financial performance for existing transactions, require different hedging strategies and require renegotiation for existing instruments. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Post\nPost controls our Company and has the ability to control the direction of our business.\nPost owns the share of our Class B Common Stock, which, for so long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) directly own more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, represents 67% of the total voting power of both classes of our outstanding common stock.\nAs long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) owns more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, it will be able to control nearly all corporate actions that require a stockholder vote, regardless of the vote of any other stockholder. As a result, Post has the ability to control significant matters involving us, including:\n\u2022\nthe election and removal of our directors;\n\u2022\ndeterminations with respect to mergers, business combinations, dispositions of assets or other extraordinary corporate transactions;\n\u2022\ncertain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital structure, including the level of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under our equity incentive plans for our prospective and existing employees; and\n\u2022\nagreements that may adversely affect us.\nAlternatively, if Post does not provide any requisite affirmative vote on matters requiring stockholder approval allowing us to take particular actions when requested, we will not be able to take such actions, and as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Even if Post owns 50% or less of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, Post will have the ability to substantially influence these matters for as long as it owns a significant portion of the voting power.\nThe interests of Post may differ from our interests or those of our other stockholders and the concentration of control in Post will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power with Post also may delay, defer or prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of our Company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Post, even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders. The concentration of voting power with Post may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Our Company may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may cause the value of an investment in us to decline.\nPost\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Conflicts of interest or disputes between Post and our Company could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our Company and our other stockholders.\nPost could have interests that differ from, or conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders and could cause us to take\ncertain actions even if the actions are not favorable to us or our other stockholders or are opposed by our other stockholders. If Post is acquired or otherwise experiences a change in control, any acquirer or successor will be entitled to exercise Post\u2019s voting control with respect to us. After the expiration of the 180-day lock-up period entered into in connection with our IPO, which expires on April 14, 2020, Post, if it has redeemed BellRing Brands, LLC units for shares of our Class A Common Stock, generally has the right at any time to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares of our Class A Common Stock that it owns, including the ability to transfer a controlling interest in us to a third party, without the approval of any other stockholder and without providing for a purchase of any other stockholder\u2019s shares of Class A Common Stock. Post and its affiliates may also directly transfer their BellRing Brands, LLC units to third parties without the consent or approval of the Board of Managers of BellRing Brands, LLC or any other party, and in connection with such transfers, subject to certain exceptions, must either grant a written proxy to, or enter into a written voting agreement or other voting arrangement with, such transferee, which provides for the right of such transferee to direct Post or its applicable affiliate, as the holder of the share of our Class B Common Stock, to cast a number of votes to which such share of Class B Common Stock is entitled on all matters in which our stockholders generally are entitled to vote equal to the number of BellRing Brands, LLC units held by such third party in the event that Post or its applicable affiliate, as the holder of the share of our Class B Common Stock, holds in the aggregate 50% or less of the BellRing Brands, LLC units. In addition, Post may determine to distribute its beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC by means of a spin-off to its shareholders.\nPotential conflicts of interest or disputes may arise between Post and us in a number of areas relating to our past or ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\ntax, employee benefits, indemnification and other matters arising from our IPO;\n\u2022\nemployee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of services Post has agreed to provide to us;\n\u2022\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both Post and us;\n\u2022\nsales or other disposals by Post of all or a portion of its ownership in BellRing Brands, LLC; and\n\u2022\nany new commercial arrangements between Post and us in the future.\nSee also potential conflicts described in \u201cOur organizational structure confers certain benefits upon Post and certain of its successors and assigns that may not benefit our Class A common stockholders to the same extent, and that could result in determinations harmful to the interests of such stockholders.\u201d\nThe resolution of any potential conflicts or disputes between Post and us may be less favorable to us than the resolution we might achieve if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nThe various ancillary agreements that we entered into with Post in connection with our IPO are of varying durations and may be amended upon agreement of the parties. The terms of these agreements were primarily determined by Post, and, therefore, may not be representative of the terms we could have obtained on a standalone basis or in negotiations with an unaffiliated third party. For as long as we are controlled by Post, we may not be able to negotiate renewals or amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would be able to negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes certain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs to the extent that they may involve Post and its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates (except that we are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for purposes of these provisions) and our rights, powers, duties and liabilities and those of our directors, officers, managers, employees and agents in connection with our relationship with Post. In general, and except as may be set forth in any agreement between us and Post, these provisions provide that Post and its affiliates may carry on and conduct any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of business as us; Post and its affiliates may do business with any of our customers, vendors and lessors; and Post and its affiliates may make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments. In addition, these provisions provide that we renounce any interest or expectancy to participate in any business of Post or its affiliates.\nMoreover, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision) or (ii) Post or its affiliates. Generally, neither Post nor our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of Post or its affiliates, directs, recommends or transfers such corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates or does not offer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us because such person has\ndirected or intends to direct such opportunity to Post or one of its affiliates. This renunciation does not extend to corporate opportunities expressly offered to one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents, solely in his or her capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of us.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will cease to apply at such time as (i) we and Post and its affiliates are no longer affiliates of one another and (ii) none of the directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post serve as our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between Post and us because the provision effectively permits one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also serves as a director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of Post or its affiliates to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates instead of to us.\nIn order to preserve the ability of Post to distribute its beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC on a tax-free basis, we may be prevented from pursuing opportunities to raise capital, to effectuate acquisitions or to provide equity incentives to our employees, which could hurt our ability to grow.\nUnder current laws, in order to effect certain tax-free distributions of its beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC, Post may wish to ensure that the aggregate value of the BellRing Brands, LLC assets owned indirectly by the holders of our Class A Common Stock does not exceed the value of Post\u2019s beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC. While Post has advised us that it does not have any definitive plans to undertake a tax-free distribution of its beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC, Post may use its majority voting interest in us to retain its ability to engage in such a transaction in the future. This may cause Post to not support transactions we wish to pursue that involve issuing shares of our common stock, including for capital raising purposes, as consideration for an acquisition or as equity incentives to our employees. The inability to pursue such transactions, if it occurs, may adversely affect our Company. See \u201cPost controls our Company and has the ability to control the direction of our business\u201d and \u201c-Post\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Conflicts of interest or disputes between Post and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our other stockholders.\u201d\nOur agreements with Post require us to indemnify Post for certain tax liabilities.\nIn connection with our IPO, BellRing Brands, Inc. and BellRing Brands, LLC entered into a tax matters agreement with Post. Under the tax matters agreement, Post is responsible for all taxes for Post\u2019s historical Active Nutrition business which relate to pre-offering periods, and BellRing Brands, LLC generally is responsible for (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of Post or any of its subsidiaries that includes BellRing Brands, LLC or any of its subsidiaries to the extent such taxes relate to post-initial public offering periods and are attributable to BellRing Brands, LLC or any of its subsidiaries, as determined under the tax matters agreement, and (ii) all taxes that relate to post-initial public offering periods imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of BellRing Brands, LLC or any of its subsidiaries, as determined under the tax matters agreement. To the extent Post fails to pay taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of Post or any of its subsidiaries that includes BellRing Brands, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, the relevant taxing authority could seek to collect such taxes (including taxes for which Post is responsible under the tax matters agreement) from BellRing Brands, Inc. or its subsidiaries.\nThe tax receivable agreement with Post and BellRing Brands, LLC requires us to make cash payments to Post for certain tax benefits we may realize in the future, and these payments could be substantial.\nPost (or certain of its transferees or assignees) may redeem BellRing Brands, LLC units for, at the option of BellRing Brands, LLC (as determined by its Board of Managers), shares of our Class A Common Stock or cash pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of BellRing Brands, LLC (the \u201cBellRing Brands, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement\u201d). These redemptions, the formation transactions that were undertaken in connection with our IPO and certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing Brands, LLC to Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) or deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) to BellRing Brands, Inc. or BellRing Brands, LLC of BellRing Brands, LLC units or assets, may result in increases in our pro rata share of the tax basis of BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s assets that otherwise would not have been available. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions allocable to us and therefore reduce the amount of income tax attributable to BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s operations we would otherwise be required to pay in the future and also may decrease gain (or increase loss) otherwise allocable to us from BellRing Brands, LLC on future dispositions of certain of BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. Furthermore, under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, we will be entitled to certain tax benefits generated by the pre-existing, contributed tax basis in BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s assets in excess of our pro rata share of such basis at the time of the partnership\u2019s formation. The IRS may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases and tax benefits and no assurances can be made regarding the availability of these tax basis increases or other tax benefits.\nIn connection with our IPO, BellRing Brands, Inc. entered into the tax receivable agreement with Post and BellRing Brands, LLC. Under the tax receivable agreement, BellRing Brands, Inc. is required to make cash payments to Post (or certain of its transferees or other assignees) equal to 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax, as well as state and local income tax and franchise tax (using an assumed tax rate on a base equal to the U.S. federal taxable income of BellRing Brands,\nInc.), that we realize (or, in some circumstances, we are deemed to realize) as a result of (a) the increase in the tax basis of the assets of BellRing Brands, LLC attributable to (i) the redemption of BellRing Brands, LLC units by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) pursuant to the BellRing Brands, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, (ii) deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) of BellRing Brands, LLC units or assets to BellRing Brands, Inc. or BellRing Brands, LLC, (iii) certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing Brands, LLC to Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) and (iv) certain formation transactions that were undertaken in connection with our IPO, (b) disproportionate allocations of tax benefits to BellRing Brands, Inc. as a result of Section 704(c) of the Code and (c) certain tax benefits (e.g., imputed interest, basis adjustments, deductions, etc.) attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Any payments made by us under the tax receivable agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreement. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are subject of the tax receivable agreement. Actual tax benefits realized by us may differ from the tax benefits calculated pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, including as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the tax receivable agreement, including the use of an assumed state and local income tax rate on a base equal to the U.S. federal taxable income of BellRing Brands, Inc. to calculate tax benefits. Payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned on Post\u2019s continued ownership of BellRing Brands, LLC units or our Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. The payment obligation is a payment obligation of BellRing Brands, Inc. and not of BellRing Brands, LLC.\nPost (or its transferees or assignees) may determine to redeem any or all of its BellRing Brands, LLC units in its sole discretion and, in such event, the actual increase in tax basis and the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any future redemptions, the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the redemption, the nature of the assets owned by BellRing Brands, LLC at the time of the redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable, the tax rates then applicable and the amount and timing of our income. If Post (and its transferees and assignees) had redeemed all of its BellRing Brands, LLC units immediately after our IPO, we would have recognized a deferred tax asset of approximately $726.0 million and a liability of approximately $617.1 million, assuming (i) a price of $14.00 per share, which was the offering price in our IPO; (ii) a constant corporate tax rate of 25.0%; (iii) we had sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits; and (iv) no material changes in tax law. These amounts are estimates and have been prepared for informational purposes only. The actual amount of deferred tax assets and related liabilities that we will recognize will differ based on, among other things, the timing of the redemptions, the price of our shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of the redemption and the tax rates then in effect.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to Post under the tax receivable agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain any such challenge. Post (and its transferees and assignees) will not reimburse us for any payments that may previously have been made under the tax receivable agreement even if the IRS or another tax authority subsequently disallows the tax basis increase or any other relevant tax item. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to Post (or its transferees or assignees) will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the tax receivable agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to Post (or its transferees or assignees) for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, in certain circumstances, we could make payments to Post under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings and become aware of that fact only at a time when there are no further payments against which to offset that excess amount.\nIn certain cases, future payments under the tax receivable agreement to Post may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a merger, asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement or materially breach any of our material obligations under the tax receivable agreement, our (or our successor\u2019s) future obligations under the tax receivable agreement would accelerate and become due and payable based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement, and that, as of the effective date of the acceleration, any BellRing Brands, LLC units that Post (or its transferees or assignees) has not yet redeemed will be deemed to have been redeemed by Post (and its transferees and assignees) for an amount based on the closing trading price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of termination, even if we do not receive the corresponding tax benefits until a later date when the BellRing Brands, LLC units are actually redeemed. Such obligations under the tax receivable agreement, however, would not arise if Post distributes its beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC by means of a spin-off to its shareholders. As a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the estimated present value as outlined in the\ntax receivable agreement of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the tax receivable agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits and, therefore, we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual tax benefits we ultimately realize. If we had elected to terminate the tax receivable agreement immediately after our IPO, based on a price of $14.00 per share, which was the offering price in our IPO, we estimate that we would have been required to pay approximately $473.1 million in the aggregate under the tax receivable agreement. This amount is an estimate and has been prepared for informational purposes only. The actual amount will differ based on, among other things, the price of our shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of any such termination and the tax rates then in effect.\nOur organizational structure confers certain benefits upon Post and certain of its successors and assigns that may not benefit our Class A common stockholders to the same extent, and that could result in determinations harmful to the interests of such stockholders.\nOur organizational structure, including the fact that Post owns more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and holds its economic interest in BellRing Brands, LLC directly, confers certain benefits upon Post that will not benefit the holders of our Class A Common Stock to the same extent as it will benefit Post. For example, the tax receivable agreement will provide for the payment by us to Post (or certain of its transferees or other assignees) of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax, as well as state and local income tax and franchise tax (using an assumed tax rate on a base equal to the U.S. federal taxable income of BellRing Brands, Inc.) that we realize (or, in some circumstances, we are deemed to realize) as a result of (a) the increase in the tax basis of assets of BellRing Brands, LLC attributable to (i) the redemption of BellRing Brands, LLC units by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) pursuant to the BellRing Brands, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, (ii) deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) of BellRing Brands, LLC units or assets to BellRing Brands, Inc., (iii) certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing Brands, LLC to Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) and (iv) certain formation transactions that were undertaken in connection with our IPO, (b) disproportionate allocations of tax benefits to BellRing Brands, Inc. as a result of Section 704(c) of the Code and (c) certain tax benefits (e.g., basis adjustments, deductions, etc.) attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, it is possible that the interests of Post may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you.\nFurther, Post may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the tax receivable agreement, that could influence its decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, whether and when we should incur new or refinance existing indebtedness and whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, changes in tax laws, the determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions (including dispositions of Post\u2019s interests in BellRing Brands, LLC, such as through a tax-free spin-off to its shareholders) and related restrictions on us, and the handling of any future challenges by any taxing authority to our tax reporting positions, may take into consideration Post\u2019s tax plans and objectives or other considerations, which may differ from the considerations of us or our other stockholders. Such determination may adversely affect our profitability or prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities to grow.\nIn the event Post is acquired or otherwise experiences a change in control, any acquirer or successor will generally succeed to the rights and obligations of BellRing Brands, LLC (including under the tax receivable agreement), and the same considerations described above apply to any such successor parties.\nIf the BellRing Brands, LLC Board of Managers elects to make cash payments rather than issue shares of our Class A Common Stock in future redemptions of BellRing Brands, LLC units, such cash payments may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the terms of the BellRing Brands, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, BellRing Brands, LLC units may be redeemed at any time for, at the option of BellRing Brands, LLC (as determined by its Board of Managers), (i) shares of our Class A Common Stock or (ii) cash (based on the market price of the shares of our Class A Common Stock). The redemption of BellRing Brands, LLC units for shares of Class A Common Stock will be at an initial redemption rate of one share of Class A Common Stock for one BellRing Brands, LLC non-voting common unit, subject to customary redemption rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. If cash payments are elected rather than the issuance of shares of our Class A Common Stock, such payments may require the payment of significant amounts of cash and may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available for distribution to us from BellRing Brands, LLC, and also may negatively affect our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy.\nFuture sales or distributions of shares of our Class A Common Stock by Post could depress our Class A Common Stock price, impact our operations or result in a change in control of us.\nSubject to the 180-day lock-up period entered into in connection with our IPO, which expires on April 14, 2020, Post generally has the right at any time, if it has redeemed BellRing Brands, LLC units for shares of our Class A Common Stock, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of the shares of our Class A Common Stock that it owns to third parties. Post and its affiliates may also directly transfer their BellRing Brands, LLC units to third parties without the consent or approval of the Board of Managers of\nBellRing Brands, LLC or any other party. In connection with such transfers, subject to certain exceptions, Post must either grant a written proxy to, or enter into a written voting agreement or other voting arrangement with, such transferee, which, if Post or its affiliates holds in the aggregate 50% or less of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, will provide for the right of such transferee to direct Post or its applicable affiliate, as the holder of the share of our Class B Common Stock, to cast a number of votes to which such share of Class B Common Stock is entitled on all matters in which our stockholders generally are entitled to vote equal to the number of BellRing Brands, LLC units held by such third party. In addition, Post may determine to distribute its beneficial retained interest in BellRing Brands, LLC by means of a spin-off to its shareholders. A sale of a controlling interest in us to a third party would result in persons other than Post controlling us and could result in a change of management or changes in our business operations and policies. Sales by Post in the public market of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock or a spin-off to its shareholders also could depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, Post has the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of its shares of our Class A Common Stock or to include its shares of our Class A Common Stock in other registration statements that we may file. In the event Post exercises its registration rights and sells all or a portion of its shares of our Class A Common Stock, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe services that Post provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, which may result in increased costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn connection with our IPO, BellRing Brands, Inc., BellRing Brands, LLC and Post entered into a master services agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d) pursuant to which Post provides certain services to us, such as legal, finance, internal audit, treasury, information technology, support, human resources, insurance and tax matters. Post is not obligated to provide these services in a manner that differs from the nature of the services it provided to us prior to our IPO, and thus we may not be able to modify these services in a manner desirable to us. Further, if we no longer receive these services from Post, we may not be able to perform these services ourselves or to find appropriate third party arrangements at a reasonable cost, and the cost may be higher than that charged by Post.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe have no operating history as a separate public company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we will achieve as a separate public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this report does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate public company during the historical periods presented, or what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be in the future as a separate public company.\nWe will incur additional expenses to create the corporate infrastructure to operate as a public company, and we will experience increased ongoing costs in connection with being a public company.\nOur business has historically used some of Post\u2019s corporate infrastructure and services to support our business functions. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure have been spread across all of Post\u2019s businesses and charged to us on a cost-allocation basis. After our IPO, except as described below, we no longer have access to Post\u2019s infrastructure or services, and we have had to establish our own. The services historically provided to us by Post included finance, information technology, legal, human resources, quality, supply chain and purchasing functions. Following our IPO, we continue to receive some of these services pursuant to the MSA with Post. There can be no assurance that all of the functions provided to us by Post under the MSA will be successfully executed by Post or that we will not have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated in the MSA. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, upon termination of the MSA, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf.\nAs a public company, we are required to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, commencing in our year ending September 30, 2020, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting. At such time as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and qualify as an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d or \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined under SEC rules, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. For these reasons, our management report on internal controls and our auditors\u2019 report are not contained in this report. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and\npossible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules.\nDuring the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadlines imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC rules. If, at such time as each is required, our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, the price of our Class A Common Stock may suffer, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, in the event we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting also could restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under \u201cCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included in this document relates to the Company's historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nAn active trading market for our Class A Common Stock may not be sustained, and the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur Class A Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) on October 17, 2019. However, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Class A Common Stock will be sustained. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors listed in this report or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, our failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, investor perceptions, or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters, which could potentially harm our business. These fluctuations could cause our stockholders to lose part of their investment in our Class A Common Stock since they might be unable to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them. Further, our Class A Common Stock likely will not be eligible to be included in certain stock indices because of our dual class voting structure. For example, in July 2017, S&P Dow Jones stated that companies with multiple share classes will not be eligible for inclusion in the S&P Composite 1500 (comprised of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock may be sold into the market at any time. These sales could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A Common Stock or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of our Class A Common Stock at a time and price they consider appropriate, and could impair our ability to raise equity capital or use our common stock as consideration for acquisitions of other businesses, investments or other corporate purposes.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise could dilute all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 500.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock, one share of Class B Common Stock and up to 50.0 million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Subject to compliance with applicable law and various ancillary agreements we entered into with Post and its affiliates (other than us) in connection with our IPO, we may issue shares of our Class A Common Stock, or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock, from time to time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, an investment, our stock incentive plans or otherwise. We may issue additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock from time to time at a discount to the market price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of issuance. Any issuance of such securities could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Consequently, our stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of our Class A Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to, among other things, our compliance with applicable law, and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The payment, including timing and amount, of any dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, including BellRing Brands, LLC, and our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted as a result of the laws of our subsidiaries\u2019 jurisdictions of organization or their agreements, including agreements governing indebtedness.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which might diminish the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Class A Common Stock. The provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by written consent of the stockholders once Post and its affiliates (other than us) no longer own of record more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units;\n\u2022\nour Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nauthorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock that will be available for future issuance;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to fix the size of the Board of Directors and fill vacancies without a stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nprovisions that have the same effect as a modified version of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an antitakeover law (as further described below); and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. We elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, except that they provide that Post and its various successors and affiliates (and certain transferees of any of them designated in writing by Post) are not deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d regardless of the percentage of our stock owned by them, and accordingly are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the significant voting power of Post and the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or implement a stockholder rights plan could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future, which could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and our election to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and currently rely on certain provisions of the JOBS Act that contain exceptions from disclosure and other requirements that otherwise are applicable to companies that file periodic reports with the SEC. These JOBS Act provisions:\n\u2022\npermit us to include less than five years of selected financial data in this report;\n\u2022\npermit us to include reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation in our SEC filings;\n\u2022\nprovide an exemption from the independent public accountant attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nprovide an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to our auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and our financial statements; and\n\u2022\nprovide an exemption from the requirement to hold non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and on golden parachute arrangements not previously approved.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years from the closing date of the IPO, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior March 31 and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months; or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Some investors may find our Class A Common Stock less attractive if we rely on these provisions, which could result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and higher volatility in our stock price.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards and we qualify for exemption from certain corporate governance requirements. We do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, but there can be no assurance that we will not rely on these exemptions in the future.\nSince Post owns more than 50% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE corporate governance standards and are eligible to rely on exemptions from the following NYSE corporate governance requirements:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have compensation and nominating/corporate governance committee(s) comprised entirely of independent directors, each with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, but there can be no assurance that we will not rely on these exemptions in the future. If we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, holders of our Class A Common Stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE rules regarding corporate governance.\nActions of stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may, from time to time, be subject to proposals and other requests from stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effect a change in our management. In the event of such stockholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.\nBellRing Brands, Inc.\u2019s only material asset is its interest in BellRing Brands, LLC, and accordingly, BellRing Brands, Inc. depends on distributions from BellRing Brands, LLC to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the tax receivable agreement. BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nBellRing Brands, Inc. is a holding company, and has no material assets other than BellRing Brands, Inc.\u2019s ownership of BellRing Brands, LLC units and has no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. BellRing Brands, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not, with the exception of certain of its subsidiaries, subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Recently enacted legislation that is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may impute liability for adjustments to a partnership\u2019s tax return on the partnership itself in certain circumstances, absent an election to the contrary. BellRing Brands, LLC may elect out of the application of these rules (but certain of its subsidiaries will likely not), but there can be no assurance that it will be eligible to do so in each tax year or that such election will be made. BellRing Brands, LLC (or its subsidiaries that are partnerships) may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this legislation and related guidance if, for example, its calculations of taxable income are incorrect. Its members may be required to reimburse BellRing Brands, LLC for taxes, interest, and penalties resulting from an audit. Taxable income is allocated to holders of BellRing Brands, LLC units, including BellRing Brands, Inc. As a result, BellRing Brands, Inc. incurs U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on its allocable share of any net taxable income of BellRing Brands, LLC. Under the terms of the BellRing Brands, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, BellRing Brands, LLC is obligated to make tax distributions pro rata to holders of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, including, in the case of BellRing Brands, Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow BellRing Brands, Inc. to pay its tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to it from BellRing Brands, LLC and to make any payments required under the tax receivable agreement. In addition to tax expenses, and expenses under the tax receivable agreement, which could be significant, BellRing Brands, Inc. also incurs expenses related to its operations. We expect that BellRing Brands, LLC will make distributions pro rata to holders of the BellRing Brands, LLC units in an amount sufficient to allow BellRing Brands, Inc. to pay its operating expenses. In addition, the BellRing Brands, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement provides that BellRing Brands, LLC will reimburse BellRing Brands, Inc. for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of BellRing Brands, Inc., including all fees, costs and expenses of BellRing Brands, Inc. associated with being a public company and maintaining its corporate existence. However, BellRing Brands, LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions or reimbursement payments may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which BellRing Brands, LLC is then a party, including any debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering BellRing Brands, LLC insolvent. If BellRing Brands, LLC does not distribute sufficient funds for BellRing Brands, Inc. to pay its taxes or other liabilities, BellRing Brands, Inc. may have to borrow funds, which could adversely affect its liquidity and subject it to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that BellRing Brands, Inc. is unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; except that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the tax receivable agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the tax receivable agreement.", "PERMNO": 18967, "SIC": 2000, "TIC": "BRBR"}
