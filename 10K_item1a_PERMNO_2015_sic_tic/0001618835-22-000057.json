{"cik": "1618835", "company": "Evofem Biosciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Annual Report and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022We have generated nominal revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\n\u2022We must raise significant additional funds to finance our operations and to remain a going concern. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our business initiatives.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Phexxi and Any Other Approved Product Candidates\n\u2022Our success will depend heavily on whether we can successfully commercialize our only commercially available product, Phexxi, for prevention of pregnancy. Failure to successfully commercialize Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy would likely cause our business to fail.\n\u2022Our commercialization strategy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic is unproven and if it is not successful, will harm our business and limit our ability to sell our product.\n\u2022If we are unable to establish effective internal sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell any of our approved products, our ability to generate revenue would be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our use of social media platforms to market and promote prescription products, such as Phexxi, presents risks and operational challenges.\n\u2022We face competition from other medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\n\u2022Phexxi and any other approved products may not gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians, patients or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our future growth prospects.\n\u2022The telehealth market is immature and unpredictable, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, if it encounters negative publicity over privacy issues, if it is difficult to engage sufficient numbers of providers, or if limitations on reimbursement or new state law regulatory requirements impede our ability to implement our telehealth solution, the growth of our business will be harmed.\n\u2022The success of Phexxi will depend on the availability of contraceptive alternatives and women\u2019s preferences, in addition to the market\u2019s acceptance of our new form of prevention of pregnancy.\n\u2022The commercial success of Phexxi or any future approved products will depend in significant measure on the label claims that the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve for those products.\n\u2022The proportion of the contraceptive market that is made up of generic products continues to increase, making introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive.\n\u2022Our business has been adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates\n\u2022Our inability to develop our vaginal pH modulator for additional indications could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully market Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy.\n\u2022The success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. Failure to identify additional product candidates would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n\u2022Clinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\n\u2022Due in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials we would like to pursue and complete.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\n\u2022If our clinical trials fail to satisfactorily demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulators, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u2022Even though we have received approval from the FDA in the United States to market Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, we may fail to receive similar approval outside the United States.\n\u2022If we are unable to take full advantage of regulatory programs designed to expedite drug development or provide other incentives, our development programs may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Post-Marketing Legal and Regulatory Compliance\n\u2022Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Phexxi or development of potential new indications for Phexxi. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u2022Our rights to develop and commercialize Phexxi for current and potential new indications are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by third parties. The patent protection and patent prosecution of Phexxi is dependent on third parties.\n\u2022If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for Phexxi for current and potential new indications, or other proprietary technologies we may develop, or if the scope of the patent protection we have or will obtain is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to our products and technology, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and other proprietary technologies we may develop may be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we do not obtain PTE for our products or product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\n\u2022Our success relies on third-party suppliers and one contract manufacturer. Any failure by these third parties, including their inability to successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, could negatively impact our business and our ability to develop and market our products or product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\n\u2022We rely and intend to rely on third parties for the execution of our development programs for our product candidates and for the delivery of telehealth services through the Phexxi telehealth platform. Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality, in accordance with applicable regulations and within acceptable time frames may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.\nRisks Related to Our Commercialization of Health Care Products\n\u2022Phexxi and any other approved product may face follow-on competition sooner than anticipated.\n\u2022Despite FDA-approval for Phexxi and even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market other product candidates in the United States, revenues may be adversely affected if Phexxi or any other the product does not obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers in the United States.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\n\u2022As we mature and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to expand the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth or be unable to successfully commercialize our products, develop any product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred yearly losses and negative cash flows since our inception, including net losses of $206.2 million and $142.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $860.7 million. Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. To date, we have devoted substantially all our financial resources to the commercialization and development of Phexxi and to the development of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea and our other product candidates, as well as providing general and administrative support for our operations. Our utilization of cash has historically been highly dependent on these development programs. We plan to spend significant capital to fund our continued commercialization efforts. Our cash expenses will also continue to be highly dependent on the product development programs we choose to pursue, including Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, the progress of these product development programs, the results of our preclinical and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory decisions regarding potential approval for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may choose to develop, and the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers and any license partners.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, notes, warrants, convertible notes, convertible preferred stock and through other debt arrangements. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in large part, on our ability to generate revenue from the sale of Phexxi, the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations or grants which may be particularly challenging or impossible in light of market conditions, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The commercialization and development of biopharmaceutical products involves a substantial degree of risk.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in future quarters and to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022incur sales, marketing, and distribution costs to commercialize Phexxi and any other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including television, media and digital promotional campaigns;\n\u2022incur costs associated with the commercial manufacturing of Phexxi and manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u2022implement post-approval changes and process improvements to manufacturing;\n\u2022continue the clinical development of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea and our other product candidates;\n\u2022initiate clinical trials for any product candidates we may choose to develop in the future;\n\u2022seek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for Phexxi, our product candidates or any product candidates we may choose to develop in the future;\n\u2022continue our efforts to identify, assess, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates;\n\u2022make milestone, royalty or other payments under third-party license agreements;\n\u2022seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022seek to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nDue in part to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we delayed the commercial launch of Phexxi from June 2020 until September of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic also led to a slower than forecasted update of Phexxi due to reduced access to medical offices and HCPs, and has also affected our ability to timely screen and enroll participants in our Phase 3 EVOGUARD trial. Should we experience any further delays or encounter issues with the commercialization, development and regulatory approval of our product candidates such as safety issues, clinical trial accrual delays and longer follow-up for planned trials, some of which may result in part due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may incur significant additional expenses.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. Due to the recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities since inception, and net working capital at December 31, 2021, the report\nof our independent registered public accountant on our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 filed with this Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes explanatory language describing the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAlthough we have generated revenue from product sales, we may never be profitable. Our operating results may differ from any guidance we may announce.\nOur current business is substantially dependent on the commercial success of Phexxi. The commercial launch of Phexxi took place on September 8, 2020, and although we have generated revenue from sales of Phexxi, we may never achieve or sustain profitability. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaborators, to successfully commercialize Phexxi and, to a lesser extent, to complete the development of, and to obtain necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to commercialize, Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea and our other current or future product candidates. Our ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the rate and degree of market acceptance for Phexxi and any other product candidates that may be approved in the future;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our commercialization strategy for Phexxi and any other product candidates that may be approved in the future, either directly or with one or more distribution partners, including the effectiveness of our sales force, the Phexxi telehealth platform, media and digital campaigns, and contracted tele-sales vendor;\n\u2022reimbursement and pricing for Phexxi and any other approved product candidates in amounts that support profitability;\n\u2022successfully competing against alternative contraceptive products;\n\u2022manufacturing Phexxi and our other product candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that are commercially feasible, as well as complying with applicable regulatory requirements and meeting our supply needs in sufficient quantities to meet market demand for Phexxi and the needs of our clinical trials;\n\u2022our ability to adapt in a dynamic and challenging pandemic environment;\n\u2022obtaining regulatory approval of Phexxi in territories outside of the United States and completing clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval for our other product candidates, including Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea;\n\u2022protecting, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter; and\n\u2022attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nFrom time to time, we may provide guidance as to our future performance and certain unit shipment information, prescription and prescriber statistics, website and search statistics and other metrics. We may fail to achieve the performance described in any guidance we may announce, and any information or metrics we may provide may be not be indicative of future results. In addition, we implemented a Phexxi co-pay program and sample program to promote demand for Phexxi. However, the co-pay program significantly reduces the amount of profit we realize per unit sold. As a result, we may curtail the co-pay program in the future. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenue from product sales of Phexxi, the revenue from product sales of Phexxi is not sufficiently profitable, we fail to meet our guidance, or our information or metrics is not indicative of our future results of operations, this could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations, the price of our common stock, our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe will need to raise significant additional funds to finance our operations, including the commercialization of Phexxi and our development of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, and to remain a going concern. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our business initiatives or to cease our operations entirely.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows since our inception. We believe our existing capital resources as of February 28, 2022, will be sufficient to sustain our planned operations into the second quarter of 2022. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully commercialize Phexxi in the United States and to successfully develop Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea in a timely manner. If, for whatever reason, we are unsuccessful in these efforts, it may make any necessary debt, equity or alternative financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Attempting to secure additional financing will divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize Phexxi or develop our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee\nthat future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In certain situations, we are also currently prohibited from raising additional debt financing without the consent of the holders of our outstanding convertible notes and promissory notes and the holders of shares of our issued and outstanding Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Furthermore, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in recent history, particularly for life science companies. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be unable to commercialize Phexxi as a contraceptive or to continue the development of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea. In addition, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our other development programs and business initiatives, or be forced to cease operations entirely. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other securities convertible into equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Future debt financings, if available at all, would likely involve agreements with additional covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, making additional product acquisitions or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations, alternative non-dilutive financing, such as royalty-based financing, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Moreover, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Given the liquidation preference owed to holders of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock and amounts currently owed pursuant to the Adjuvant Notes, the Baker Notes and other debt arrangements, holders of our common stock may not receive value for their shares in the event of a liquidation.\nWe have certain obligations pursuant to our issued and outstanding promissory notes, convertible notes and related note purchase agreements, and our failure to comply with these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase and Securities Agreement (the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement) with certain institutional investors and their designated agent pursuant to which we issued and sold secured convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. In October 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Adjuvant Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which we issued and sold to certain institutional investors unsecured convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million. In November 2021, we entered into the first amendment to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement which extends the affirmative covenant to achieve $100.0 million in cumulative net sales of Phexxi by June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023, effective when we achieve one or more equity financings resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least $50.0 million. We plan to seek a similar amendment to the Adjuvant Notes, but there can be no assurance that this will occur. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to complete the financing or financings required to amend the net sales covenants in the Adjuvant Notes or the Baker Notes. In January 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201c2022 Purchase Agreement\u201d) with certain institutional investors pursuant to which we issued warrants and unsecured subordinate promissory notes with an original principal amount of $5.8 million (the January 2022 Notes). In March 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the March 2022 Purchase Agreement) with certain institutional investors pursuant to which we issued warrants and unsecured subordinate promissory notes with an original principal amount of $7.45 million (the March 2022 Notes; collectively with the Baker Bros. Notes, the Adjuvant Notes and the January 2022 Notes, the Notes). These debt arrangements limit our ability to incur debt, merge, or declare dividends and, in certain circumstances and with respect to the January 2022 Notes and March 2022 Notes, the holders may require us to redeem outstanding amounts out of gross proceeds raised in certain subsequent offerings which could mean money raised in these offerings would not ultimately be able to be used to fund our ongoing operations. The Baker Notes are secured by substantially all of our assets. Our failure to make payments as due under any of the Notes could be an event of default under all of the Notes. Events of default under these arrangements could also include, but are not limited to, a material breach of representations, our failure to comply with our obligation to convert convertible notes, our failure to perform or observe, and in certain instances, cure, certain covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants requiring us to maintain the listing of shares of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market and, assuming no further amendment of current Note terms, to achieve cumulative net sales of Phexxi of at least $100.0 million by June 30, 2022. In the event of a default and depending on the terms of each Note, a holder of the Notes may be entitled to redemption premiums, treble amounts and other remedies described in their respective agreements. Any default could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as increase our need to raise additional capital, cause us to cease our operations entirely and may result in the holders of our common stock not receiving any value for their investment.\nWe have a limited number of shares of common stock available for future issuance which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or consummate strategic transactions.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 500 million shares of common stock under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As of March 2, 2022, we have issued 168,783,009 shares of common stock and approximately 197,117,733 shares of common stock were committed for issuance giving effect to the assumed exercise of all outstanding warrants and options and the assumed conversion of all issued and outstanding convertible notes and outstanding shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock as of this date. Until late April 2022, the number of shares of common stock we are required to reserve for issuance upon conversion of shares of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to full ratchet adjustment for certain dilutive issuances. The conversion prices of the Adjuvant Convertible Notes (if amended) and Baker Convertible Notes may also be subject to adjustment depending on the price of issuances in future financings as described above. These adjustments would further increase the numbers of shares of common stock to be reserved as a result of these adjustments. If we make additional draws from the Equity Line of Credit this would further limit the number of shares available for issuance. Due to the limited number of authorized shares common stock available for future issuance, we may not able to raise additional equity capital or complete a merger or other business combination unless we increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue. We would need to seek stockholder approval to increase the number of our authorized shares of Common Stock, and we can provide no assurance that we would succeed in amending our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock we are authorized to issue which could negatively impact our business, prospects and results of operations.\nUse of net operating loss carryforwards may be limited and U.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities may be limited as a result of ownership changes. Corresponding rules may apply under state tax laws. Even if there is no limitation on utilization of our NOL carryforwards as the result of an ownership change, the utilization of NOL carryforwards may be limited by other applicable laws. Pursuant to the TCJA passed in December 2017, carryforwards originating from a loss incurred in a year after 2017 are limited and may reduce taxable income in any post-2020 year by no more than 80% of the pre-NOL taxable income in such year. The CARES Act temporarily suspended this 80% taxable income limitation, allowing an NOL carryforward to fully offset taxable income in tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. Additional legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any governmental authority. We cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments which could have a negative impact on our financial results, including a potential increase in federal corporate tax rates generally. We cannot estimate how the changes in tax law from this legislation will affect our tax liability in future years, but we have recorded a valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits from those assets. We have established a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties as to their utilization. While we use our best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for our tax obligations. A challenge by a taxing authority, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual results to deviate from previous estimates.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Phexxi and Any Other Approved Product Candidates\nOur success will depend heavily on whether we can successfully commercialize our only commercially available product, Phexxi, for prevention of pregnancy. Failure to successfully commercialize Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy would likely cause our business to fail.\nOur overall success will rely heavily on the commercial success of Phexxi vaginal gel for prevention of pregnancy. Failure to successfully commercialize Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy would likely cause our business to fail. There are numerous examples of failures to meet high expectations of market potential for new product launches in the health care space, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than us. If the commercialization of Phexxi is unsuccessful or perceived as disappointing, our stock price could decline significantly.\nIf we are unable to establish effective internal sales and marketing capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell any of our approved products, our ability to generate revenue would be adversely affected.\nAlthough some of our employees may have previously marketed, commercialized and sold other pharmaceutical products, including contraceptives, while employed at other companies, we have limited experience selling and marketing Phexxi. We may face difficulties recruiting and hiring representatives and otherwise obtaining these marketing capabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic where, among other restrictions, nonessential business travel and in-person interviews have been eliminated or significantly curtailed by the implementation of social distancing guidelines and a general reluctance of some to engage in these activities. At this time, we are unable to predict how long these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will\nlast. Any failure or delay in the timely development of our internal commercialization capabilities could adversely impact the potential for commercial success of Phexxi. While we plan to utilize our sales and marketing infrastructure for Phexxi to successfully commercialize any additional products that may result from our development programs, we may still need to find one or more collaborators to commercialize these products or further invest in and develop these capabilities, either on our own or with others, which would be expensive, difficult and time consuming.\nIf commercialization collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing and sales capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain or grow our business.\nIf we are unable to effectively train and equip our sales force, our ability to successfully commercialize Phexxi will be harmed.\nWe may not be able to maintain the requisite sales force to market Phexxi. Even if we are able to maintain the requisite sales force, Phexxi is a newly-marketed drug and, therefore, none of the members of our sales force has extensive experience promoting Phexxi. We expect to continue to expend significant time and resources to train our sales consultants in marketing Phexxi. In addition, we must train our sales force to ensure that an appropriate and compliant message about Phexxi is being delivered. Our efforts to train our sales force may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to the fact that we may be unable to conduct in-person meetings and training sessions. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with compliant and effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them appropriately inform and educate physicians regarding the potential benefits of Phexxi, our efforts to successfully commercialize Phexxi could be put in jeopardy, which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues.\nOur use of social media platforms to market and promote prescription products, such as Phexxi, presents risks and operational challenges.\nWe believe that our customer base and potential patient populations for Phexxi are active on social media, and we have engaged and intend to continue to engage through those platforms to elevate our national marketing presence in direct to consumer marketing. Social media practices in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, our marketed product, which could result in regulatory reporting obligations or the need for us to conduct an investigation. The use of influencers and patient ambassadors to promote Phexxi also may be subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as comparable state consumer protection laws, and we are responsible for training those influencers on the compliant messages they can deliver to consumers about Phexxi. Any actual or perceived non-compliance by our marketing partners with those requirements could lead to an investigation by the FTC or a comparable state agency, or could lead to allegations of misleading advertising by private plaintiffs. In addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us or our product on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with any applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business such as reputational damage.\nWe face competition from other medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the women\u2019s health sector, are intensely competitive. Significant competition among various contraceptive products already exists. Existing products have name recognition, are marketed by companies with established commercial infrastructures, and are marketed with greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. To compete and gain market share, any new product will need to demonstrate advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety, among other things. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to Phexxi. These products could offer an alternative form of non-hormonal contraceptive that is more convenient, is more effective and/or provides protection over longer periods of time as compared to Phexxi. We also compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists, and sales and marketing and clinical development personnel, which could negatively affect our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. We also face competition in establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling subjects for clinical trials and in connection with identifying and engaging in strategic transactions. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies who have significantly more resources than Evofem. These companies include Merck & Co., Inc., Allergan PLC,\nPfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Johnson & Johnson, CooperSurgical Inc. and Mylan Inc. Additionally, several generic manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic contraceptives.\nPhexxi and any other approved products may not gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians, patients or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our future growth prospects.\nEven though Phexxi vaginal gel has been approved by the FDA for commercial sale for the prevention of pregnancy and even if any of our other product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any new product by physicians, patients and the medical community will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022demonstrated evidence of efficacy and safety and potential advantages compared to competing products;\n\u2022perceptions by the medical community, physicians, and patients, regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products and the willingness of the target patient population to try new products and of physicians to prescribe them;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the regulatory label requirements for the product, including any potential restrictions on use or precautionary statements;\n\u2022sufficient third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022effectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy;\n\u2022the willingness of wholesalers and pharmacies to stock the products;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022our ability to sufficiently educate physicians with respect to the efficacy and safety of Phexxi; and\n\u2022availability of alternative products and the cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products.\nIf any approved product that we may license, develop or sell, including Phexxi, does not provide a benefit over currently available options, that product is unlikely to achieve market acceptance, and we will not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nFurther, due in part to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a reduced acceptance rate for Phexxi as women were reluctant to switch birth control or physically visit a doctor in person to obtain a birth control prescription. We aim to increase acceptance through the Phexxi telehealth platform and by encouraging telehealth appointments, but there can be no assurance this effort will be successful or that acceptance will be what it might have otherwise been without the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may have a reduced ability for our distribution or sales representatives to visit physician offices to provide in-person education regarding the benefits of Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy. To the extent our marketing and education efforts are restricted by COVID-19, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe telehealth market is immature and unpredictable, and if it does not develop, if it develops more slowly than we expect, if it encounters negative publicity over privacy issues, if it is difficult to engage sufficient numbers of providers, or if limitations on reimbursement or new state law regulatory requirements impede our ability to implement our telehealth platform, the growth of our business will be harmed.\nWe operate a telehealth platform where women can directly meet with HCPs to determine their eligibility for Phexxi and potentially have prescriptions written. The telehealth market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, consumer acceptance and market adoption. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of women to use our telehealth solution. Negative publicity concerning our telehealth solution or the telehealth industry as a whole could limit market acceptance of the Phexxi telehealth platform. Additionally, telehealth laws are rapidly changing, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant public health emergency. Many states are loosening telehealth restrictions to facilitate remote care, but these changes are typically by executive order and are intended to be temporary for the duration of the public health emergency. There is no guarantee that telehealth will be permitted in the same way in the future. Changes by state professional licensing boards to the standards of care or other requirements governing the practice of telehealth, including imposition of new requirements for prescriptions from state and federal regulatory bodies, could impact the success of our telehealth solution. Similarly, individual and health care industry concerns or negative publicity regarding patient confidentiality and privacy in the context of telehealth could limit market acceptance of our solution. If any of these events occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and patients\u2019 reduced access to physician offices to obtain new birth control prescriptions or otherwise consider switching their primary method of contraception.\nThe success of Phexxi will depend on the availability of contraceptive alternatives and women\u2019s preferences, in addition to the market\u2019s acceptance of our new form of prevention of pregnancy.\nThe commercial success of Phexxi will depend upon the contraceptive market as well as market acceptance of Phexxi as a new form of prevention of pregnancy. Risks related to market acceptance include, among other things:\n\u2022minimum acceptable contraceptive efficacy rates and the related regulatory label requirements, including any potential restrictions on use or precautionary statements;\n\u2022perceived safety differences of hormonal and/or non-hormonal contraceptive options;\n\u2022changing women\u2019s preferences;\n\u2022the ACA\u2019s effect on pharmaceutical coverage, reimbursement and pricing, and the coverage of preventable services (including contraception under certain conditions); and\n\u2022new generic contraceptive options including the possibility of a future potential generic version of Phexxi as a contraceptive.\nFor example, the pregnancy rate for typical use of Phexxi in the FDA-approved label is higher than many other forms of contraceptives, and we cannot be certain that the associated risk of unintended pregnancy will not deter adoption of Phexxi as a method of pregnancy prevention. In addition, Phexxi\u2019s label contains a warning related to use by women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, which could limit the willingness of HCPs to prescribe or certain women to use Phexxi. These risks could reduce the market potential for Phexxi or any future contraceptive product we may seek to develop, and place pressure on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of Phexxi or any future approved products will depend in significant measure on the label claims that the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve for those products.\nThe commercial success of Phexxi vaginal gel and any future approved products will depend in significant measure upon the prescribing information and the patient-directed labeling describing the product\u2019s features, benefits and risks.\nWe are required to submit all revisions to approved product labeling for Phexxi as part of a supplemental NDA, to the FDA for review and approval. In addition, the FDA must review and approve proposed labeling for any of our product candidates as part of the NDA pre-market review process. Failure to achieve approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities of product labeling containing certain types of information on features or benefits will prevent or substantially limit our advertising and promotion of such features in order to differentiate our product candidates from those products already existing in the market. This failure would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses for prescription drugs and medical devices. If we are found or alleged to have improperly promoted our commercial product for off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products such as Phexxi. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Promotional labeling for Phexxi, and for any other of our products that receive marketing approval, must be submitted to FDA at the time of first use. The agency actively solicits reports from health care professionals about improper drug manufacturer promotional claims or activities. If we are found to have promoted Phexxi for any off-label use, we may become subject to significant liability and potentially reputational harm. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of Phexxi or any of our product candidates, if approved in the future, to ensure compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business.\nAny name we intend to use for our current or future product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, we would lose any goodwill or brand recognition developed for previously used names and marks, as well as the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of Phexxi or our product candidates in development, our reputation and the commercialization of Phexxi could be harmed and we may be forced to cease development of such product candidates.\nIf concerns should arise about the actual or anticipated clinical outcomes regarding the safety or efficacy of any of our current or future product candidates, such concerns could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of these candidates. Such concerns could lead to a decline in investors\u2019 expectations, adverse effects on our results of operations and a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on market research conducted internally and on our behalf to evaluate the potential commercial acceptance of Phexxi for current and potential new indications, and any other future product candidates.\nWe have contracted with and expect to continue to perform market research and to contract with third parties to perform research on our behalf. These research findings may not be indicative or predictive of actual or overall market acceptance and any future market research may not be indicative of the acceptance for Phexxi for contraception, prevention of chlamydia, prevention of gonorrhea, or future product candidates we may develop. Moreover, our internal and external research that have informed our views with respect to our sales and marketing strategy, payer coverage, pricing and reimbursement with respect to Phexxi may prove to be incorrect. For example, we believe that women that are most likely to use Phexxi as their primary method of preventing pregnancy are those that are unwilling to use hormone-based contraceptives and are unsatisfied with existing non-hormonal alternatives. If our market research has overestimated the size of this population or the willingness of these women to try Phexxi, the commercialization of Phexxi may be less successful than we or others expect.\nThere can be no assurance on the accuracy or completeness of certain facts, forecasts and other statistics obtained from various government publications, market data providers and other independent third-party sources, including industry expert reports, contained in this Annual Report or other statements we may make from time to time.\nCertain facts, forecasts and other statistics contained in this Annual Report and that we may discuss from time to time have been derived from various government publications, market data providers and other third-party sources. While we have no reason to believe that this information is false or misleading or that any fact has been omitted that would render this information false or misleading, we cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of this information. While we have taken reasonable care to ensure that these facts, forecasts and other statistics have been accurately reproduced from their respective sources, these facts, forecasts and other statistics have not been independently verified by us, our directors, advisers or any other parties and none of us make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Due to possibly flawed or ineffective collection methods or discrepancies between published information and market practice and other problems, the facts, forecasts and statistics contained herein may be inaccurate or may not be comparable to information produced by other parties. Therefore, you should give consideration as to how much weight or importance you should attach to or place on these facts, forecasts or statistics and in all cases, but particularly with respect to market size, this information should not be unduly relied upon.\nThe proportion of the contraceptive market that is made up of generic products continues to increase, making the introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive.\nThe proportion of the U.S. market that is made up of generic products has been increasing over time. This trend is occurring in the women\u2019s health segment, as well, where many of the most popular oral contraceptive pills brands have experienced genericization. Assuming this trend continues, it may be more challenging to introduce Phexxi or any future\napproved contraceptive product candidate we may develop as a branded contraceptive, at a price that will maximize our revenue and profits. Also, there may be additional marketing costs to introduce Phexxi in order to overcome the trend towards generics and to gain access to reimbursement by payers. If we are unable to introduce any future approved product candidate at a price that is commensurate with that of current branded products, or if we are unable to gain reimbursement from payers for Phexxi, or if patients are unwilling to pay any price differential between Phexxi and a generic contraceptive product, our revenues will be limited. As part of our launch strategy, we are covering the cost of Phexxi for the first month for women with commercial insurance whose health plans do not reimburse for Phexxi or whose health plans require a co-pay for Phexxi, and we are covering the cost of subsequent refills of Phexxi at a $30 co-pay for these women if their co-pay is above that amount. However, we cannot be certain that these initiatives will be successful in overcoming general inclinations of physicians and their patients to avoid branded contraceptives and these initiatives may become prohibitively expensive. If we choose to curtail our co-pay programs, demand for Phexxi may decrease. In addition, if health care plans do not add Phexxi to their covered formularies within the timelines we expect or impose more restrictive co-pay than we expect, our costs of providing these incentive programs will increase beyond our expectations and reduce our product margins and net revenues from sales of Phexxi.\nOur business has been adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny outbreak or pandemic of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and its variants, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures, as well as adverse impacts on health care resources, facilities and providers, in California, across the United States and in other countries. A number of health care systems have had to restructure operations to prioritize caring for COVID-19 patients and limit or cease other activities. The severe burden on health care systems caused by this pandemic has impaired the ability of physicians to diagnose and treat patients with non-COVID-19 related conditions, including routine women\u2019s health visits, and impaired the ability of many clinical research sites to continue existing studies, start new studies, enroll new patients and monitor patients in clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses, commerce and commercial spending, as significant reductions in business related activities have occurred, unemployment has risen, supply chains have been disrupted, and certain manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended. The continued impact of COVID-19 on our operations or those of our third-party partners and suppliers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the ultimate duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, the success of ongoing vaccination efforts, the emergence, prevalence and strength of variant strains, actions taken to contain or treat the disease as well as the continued impact on local, regional, national and international markets, among others.\nOur business has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic and in accordance with direction from state and local government authorities, we took precautionary measures in 2020 and 2021 intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring most employees to work remotely (which in turn increases the threat to our cyber security and data accessibility, and communication matters) and suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees. We are heavily reliant on our employees to perform the day to day operation of our business, and to the extent multiple employees are unavailable at the same time due to an outbreak or to personal illness, our ability to complete these day to day operations may be impaired. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has already affected and will likely continue to affect our commercialization activities for Phexxi. For example, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the restrictions on physician interactions, we made the strategic decision to delay the commercial launch of Phexxi from June 2020 to September 2020. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also made the decision to reduce our target initial internal sales force and rely more on telehealth for marketing, including the Phexxi telehealth platform. Nevertheless, the restrictions on in person contact have limited the ability of our sales representatives to meet with HCPs in person and have also significantly reduced the number of visits by patients to physician offices. These factors may continue to slow the rate of adoption of Phexxi. With respect to our clinical development efforts, the completion of enrollment from our EVOGUARD clinical trial was delayed due in part due to challenges related to COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. As and if COVID-19 and its variants continue to affect individuals, businesses and industries, economies and markets around the globe, we and our third party partners and suppliers may experience further effects on our business and results of operations stemming directly or indirectly from the pandemic, some of which could severely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates\nOur inability to develop our vaginal pH modulator for additional indications could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully market Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy.\nWe believe our vaginal pH modulator gel may be useful in certain indications outside of the prevention of pregnancy. In August 2019, we completed a Phase 2B/3 clinical trial designed to assess Phexxi for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia in women and for the prevention of gonorrhea in women. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that the trial met both its primary and secondary endpoints, with women receiving Phexxi experiencing a relative risk reduction for chlamydia and gonorrhea infection of 50% and 78%, respectively, compared to women receiving placebo.\nWe expect top-line EVOGUARD results in the second half of 2022, but we cannot guarantee that the results of this trial will be consistent with the results of the prior Phase 2B/3 clinical trial. Even if we do complete this clinical development, there is no assurance we will obtain regulatory approval of Phexxi for the prevention of either chlamydia or gonorrhea. Such a failure could also impede our ability to market Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy. Also, any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for additional indications will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or our financial condition.\nIndemnity claims from lawsuits or damages against our clinical trial sites could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Phexxi and any other product candidates we may develop.\nIn connection with our clinical trials, our third-party investigators and clinical trial sites face inherent risk of liability exposure from patients enrolled in our clinical trials. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our clinical trial sites obligating us to defend the sites against third-party claims or reimburse the sites should they incur certain costs or liability in connection with our clinical trials.\nWe currently carry product liability insurance with policy limits we believe are customary for similarly situated companies and adequate to provide us with coverage for foreseeable risks. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage.\nIf we or our clinical trial sites cannot successfully defend against product liability or other health related claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims and/or litigation may result in decreased demand for Phexxi and any other product candidates we may develop, injury to our reputation, negative media attention and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our product development and commercialization efforts to address claim related matters.\nThe success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. Failure to identify additional product candidates would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the commercialization of Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy and development of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, the success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. We are seeking to license, or otherwise obtain, product and technology rights to a variety of products and product candidates in the field of women\u2019s health, but there can be no assurance we will be able to do so, or do so on favorable terms. There are risks, uncertainties and costs associated with identifying, licensing and advancing product candidates through successful clinical development. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022our research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022we may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022our product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\n\u2022our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022product candidates we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022the market for a product candidate may change during our program such that a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022research and development programs are quite costly, and we may be unable to obtain the financing and resources to do so;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payers.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, partner, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, even if we were able to obtain the rights to additional product candidates, there can be no assurance these candidates will ever be advanced successfully through clinical development.\nClinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nClinical development is expensive, time consuming and involves significant risk. We cannot guarantee any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. In addition, certain of our product candidates are targeted toward the prevention of STIs. Therefore, it may be especially difficult to recruit patients to participate in our clinical trials when doing so will require patients to refrain from other methods of disease prevention. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022inability to obtain the funding necessary to initiate or complete any clinical trial;\n\u2022inability to generate satisfactory preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data or to develop diagnostics capable of supporting the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with clinical research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites and principal investigators, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022delays or failure in obtaining required institutional review board (IRB) approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022failure to obtain or delays in obtaining authorization from regulatory authorities to conduct or begin a clinical trial;\n\u2022delays in recruiting or failure to recruit sufficient eligible patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022failure to manufacture clinical trial scale quantities of our product candidate;\n\u2022failure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements or protocols;\n\u2022failure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to perform in accordance with the good clinical practices requirements of the FDA, applicable laws or applicable foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022patients withdrawing from our clinical trials;\n\u2022adverse events or other issues of concern significant enough for an IRB to suspend or terminate a clinical trial or for the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authority, to put an IND or comparable foreign clinical trial application on clinical hold;\n\u2022occurrence of adverse events associated with our product candidates that may make it more difficult to recruit subjects or cause other material delays in the clinical programs;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials that may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs in other ongoing or planned indications for a product candidate; and\n\u2022delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party manufacturers and the time for manufacture of sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials.\nIn addition to the possible events described above, our clinical trials may also be impacted by matters beyond our control. For example, conditions and circumstances surrounding the current COVID-19 pandemic delayed enrollment in our Phase 3 EVOGUARD trial and may again make it difficult for us, and our third-party service providers, to recruit, enroll, retain and monitor patients in these trials, disrupt the necessary logistic and manufacturing activities related to our clinical trials, require us to adjust our trial protocols, lead to a failure to collect in a timely manner key data necessary to support trial endpoints or otherwise compromise our ability to collect reliable data, result in delays in related communications and activities with the FDA or other comparable regulatory organizations and may affect our clinical trials in ways we may not presently predict.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional non-clinical studies and/or clinical trials to show the results obtained from such new formulation or manufacturing process are consistent with previous results obtained. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials we would like to pursue and complete.\nWe have limited financial and technical resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts for our product candidates and any future candidates we may choose to develop. Due to our limited available financial resources, we may be required to curtail clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates, or product candidates we may in the future choose to develop, through the regulatory and development processes. We may make incorrect determinations regarding the indications and clinical trials on which to focus our available resources. The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources towards particular indications may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nWe are required to obtain regulatory approval prior to marketing or commercializing any of our product candidates and we also must obtain regulatory approval from international authorities should we elect to commercialize Phexxi outside of the United States. To obtain regulatory approval, we must complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials in compliance with the regulatory approval requirements of the FDA and any applicable and comparable foreign regulators. If our clinical trials fail to satisfactorily demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulators, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWith the exception of Phexxi vaginal gel for the prevention of pregnancy, which has been approved by the FDA for U.S. marketing and patient use, we are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Comparable foreign regulatory authorities impose similar restrictions, and we do not have marketing approval for Phexxi in any country outside of the United States. We may never receive such approvals, and we may need to complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in other populations before we may be able to obtain these approvals.\nAny inability to complete preclinical and clinical development successfully could result in additional costs to us and impair our ability to generate revenues. Moreover, if (i) we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other nonclinical testing of our product candidates beyond the trials and testing we currently contemplate, (ii) we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, (iii) the results of these clinical trials or tests are unfavorable,\nuncertain or are only modestly favorable or (iv) there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we may:\n\u2022be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022be subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or\n\u2022be required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials for our product candidates, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nTo date, we have not received approval from the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to market any of our product candidates, with the exception of Phexxi vaginal gel, which is approved by FDA for the prevention of pregnancy. Despite the experience of our management team in completing successful regulatory filings for other companies, we have only submitted one NDA to date for Phexxi as a contraceptive product, so we have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication in the relevant patient population to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness for that indication. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that our unapproved product candidates or any potential future product candidate is not effective, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval for the product or that limit or restrict its commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies, clinical trials or other trials. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nFrom time to time, we may report top-line data from our clinical trials. These top-line data may differ from complete trial results once additional data are received and evaluated by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nTop-line data are based on a preliminary analysis of currently available efficacy and safety data, and therefore these results are subject to change, either by us or the FDA (or comparable foreign regulatory authorities), following a comprehensive review of the more extensive data we expect to receive when the full data set becomes available. Top-line data are based on important assumptions, estimations, calculations and information currently available to us. As a result, the top-line results may differ from the full data, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify these top-line results, once the complete data have been received and fully evaluated. If these initial data analyses differ from the results of the full data analyses, in a manner not favorable to the development of our product candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and, ultimately, the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nEven though we have received approval from the FDA in the United States to market Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, we may fail to receive similar approval outside the United States.\nTo market a new product outside the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals in each jurisdiction and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries, including clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing manufacture distribution and safety requirements. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ\nfrom, and be longer than, that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process in other countries may include all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a new product must receive pricing and reimbursement approval prior to commercialization. This can result in substantial delays in these countries. Additionally, the product labeling requirements outside the United States are different and may be inconsistent with the United States labeling requirements, negatively affecting our ability to market our products in countries outside the United States.\nIn addition, if we are unable to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In such an event, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of Phexxi will be harmed, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur development and regulatory approval strategy for Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea depends, in part, on published scientific literature and the FDA\u2019s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of approved products.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments added section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA, as well as several other provisions. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for the purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature or the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA may also require the applicant to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the section 505(b)(2) applicant. The FDA may require an applicant\u2019s product label to have all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the reference product\u2019s label, including a black box warning, or may require the label to have additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions. We plan to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway for our future marketing application for Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, if the EVOGUARD is successful and the totality of the data collected on Phexxi are sufficient to support regulatory approval.\nNotwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, over the last few years some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. If the FDA changes its interpretation of section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or if the FDA\u2019s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any section 505(b)(2) NDAs we submit in the future. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to take full advantage of regulatory programs designed to expedite drug development or provide other incentives, our development programs may be adversely impacted.\nThere are a number of incentive programs administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to facilitate development of drugs in areas of unmet medical need. Phexxi has been designated by the FDA as a QIDP for the prevention of both chlamydia and gonorrhea in women. Phexxi also received a Fast Track designation from the FDA for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea in women. Phexxi may not qualify for or maintain designations under these or other incentive programs under any of the FDA\u2019s existing or future programs to expedite drug development in areas of unmet medical need. Our inability to fully take advantage of these incentive programs may require us to run larger trials, incur delays, lose opportunities that may not otherwise be available to us, lose marketing exclusivity for which we would otherwise be eligible and incur greater expense in the development of our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Post-Marketing Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nEven though we have obtained FDA approval for Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy and even if we obtain regulatory approval for Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea or any other product candidates we may seek to develop, we will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements.\nEven though Phexxi vaginal gel has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of pregnancy and even if Phexxi is approved for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea or any other product candidate we may seek to develop are approved, we are and will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements with respect to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing clinical trials and submission of safety, efficacy\nand other post-approval information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to continuously comply with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations and corresponding foreign regulatory manufacturing requirements. Accordingly, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA submission to the FDA or any other type of domestic or foreign MAA.\nAny regulatory approvals we receive for Phexxi, or for any other product candidates we may seek to develop, may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. For example, the FDA has asked us to conduct, and we have agreed to conduct, a post-approval safety study in female adolescents for the use of Phexxi to prevent the acquisition of chlamydia. We will be required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with Phexxi or a future product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or it disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, the regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we are unable to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022issue warning letters;\n\u2022impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law would require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate adverse publicity. Any inability to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products and the value of our business and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nDevelopments after a product reaches the market may adversely affect sales of the product.\nEven though Phexxi has been approved in the United States for the prevention of pregnancy and even assuming any of our other product candidates were to be approved, certain developments may decrease market demand for our products, including the following:\n\u2022the re-review of products that are already marketed;\n\u2022new scientific information and evolution of scientific theories;\n\u2022the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;\n\u2022changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and\n\u2022greater examination of advertising and promotion.\nIn the past, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or addition of restrictive labeling of marketed products. If previously unknown side effects are discovered with one of the active ingredients in, or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects related to Phexxi or any of our product candidates following marketing approval, this could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy or development of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure in commercializing Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy and in conducting clinical trials of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea and other product candidates we may seek to develop or commercialize. If serious adverse events or undesirable side effects occur during or following the commercialization of Phexxi, or during the clinical investigation or post marketing of Phexxi or our other product candidates, the following events could occur which would materially and adversely affect our business:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of specific warnings or contraindications to product labeling or the issuance of alerts to physicians, pharmacies and the general public;\n\u2022we may be required to change the way Phexxi or our other product candidates are administered or to revise the labeling of Phexxi or our other product candidates;\n\u2022we may be subject to promotional and marketing limitations on Phexxi and our product candidates;\n\u2022sales of Phexxi and our other approved products, if any, may decrease significantly;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require us to take Phexxi or, should any of our other product candidates be approved, our other approved products off the market;\n\u2022IRBs may suspend or terminate our clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may impose a clinical hold, which could result in substantial delays and adversely impact our ability to continue development of our product candidates;\n\u2022we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials with more patients or over longer periods of time than anticipated;\n\u2022we may be required to implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), which could result in substantial cost increases and have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize Phexxi or our other approved products, if any;\n\u2022we may be required to limit the patients who can receive Phexxi or our product candidates;\n\u2022we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Phexxi or our other product candidates, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from Phexxi or our other product candidates. Serious adverse events or side effects could require Phexxi to be taken off the market, may require them to be packaged with safety warnings or may otherwise limit our sales.\nFurther, if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for Phexxi or other product candidates we may seek to develop, injury to our reputation, negative media attention and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our product development and commercialization efforts to address claim related matters.\nWe will need to maintain liability insurance coverage as we continue to commercialize Phexxi and conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. This insurance may become increasingly expensive and difficult to procure. In the future, this insurance may not be available to us at all or may only be available at a very high cost and, if available, may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur. In addition, while we have increased our liability insurance coverage in connection with the commercialization of Phexxi, we cannot be certain our coverage limits will be sufficient to cover liability claims we may face. We will also need to increase liability coverage if Phexxi is approved for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea or any other product candidate we may seek to develop is approved. If we are not able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturer\u2019s and suppliers\u2019 activities may involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our manufacturer and supplier, and our potential future manufacturers and suppliers, are and will be subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use may be stored at our and our current and potential future manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations; environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up; and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe the safety procedures utilized by us and our current third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of specified materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur rights to develop and commercialize Phexxi are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by third parties. The patent protection and patent prosecution of Phexxi is dependent on third parties.\nWe are reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the commercialization of Phexxi and for the development of EVO100. For example, the Rush License Agreement includes intellectual property rights to Phexxi and EVO100. This agreement requires us, as a condition to the maintenance of our license and other rights, to make milestone and royalty payments and satisfy certain performance obligations. As of March 10, 2022, we are current on all such obligations, financial and otherwise, and, pursuant to the Rush License Agreement, we have obtained a waiver of any potential claim of breach based on any provisions requiring us to timely exploit the licensed patent or make minimum royalty payments.\nIn addition, with respect to Phexxi and EVO100, Rush University has the right, in certain instances, to control the defense against any infringement litigation arising from the manufacture or development (but not the sale) of Phexxi and EVO100. While the Rush License Agreement requires Rush University to indemnify us for certain losses arising from these claims, this indemnification may not be sufficient to adequately compensate us for any related losses or the potential loss of our ability to manufacture and develop Phexxi and EVO100. In general, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-license. If other third parties have ownership rights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, or other proprietary technologies we may develop, or if the scope of the patent protection we have or will obtain is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to our products and technology, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and other proprietary technologies we may develop may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our products, product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. We seek to protect our proprietary position by in-licensing intellectual property and filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nChanges in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our owned and licensed patents. With respect to both in-licensed and owned intellectual property, we cannot predict whether the patent applications we and our licensors are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or other third parties. Our pending and issued patent claims for Phexxi are not broad, and it is possible that a competitor may seek to make modifications to their product in an effort to design around our patent claims and avoid infringement. Furthermore, if any such competitor or third party is able to demonstrate bioequivalence without infringing our patents, then such a competitor or third party would then be able to introduce a competitive generic product onto the market once any available regulatory exclusivity has expired. The FDA has broad discretion in determining whether a potential competitive product demonstrates bioequivalence; we are not able to predict the extent to which a competitor or third party might be able to demonstrate bioequivalence without infringing our patents.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible we will be unsuccessful in our efforts to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our inventions and the prior art allow our inventions to be patentable over the prior art. Furthermore, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in any of our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our owned or in-licensed pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect Phexxi and other product candidates or proprietary technologies that we may seek to develop or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates.\nMoreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we license or own currently or in the future issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents we own or in-license may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether Phexxi and other proprietary technology will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We or our licensors may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review, or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging our owned or licensed\npatent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our owned or in-licensed patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize generic versions of our products, product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, we, or one of our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge our or our licensor\u2019s priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity, or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.\nIn addition, given the amount of time required for the commercialization, development, testing, and regulatory review of our products and product candidates, patents protecting such products and product candidates might expire before or shortly after such products or product candidates are fully commercialized. The patent rights licensed to us under the Rush University License expire in 2023. If we are unable to obtain extensions of the patent rights, these patent rights will no longer protect Phexxi, and we will be relying solely on our directly owned patent formulas and patent application families for patent protection for Phexxi. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Moreover, some of our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications may in the future be co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners\u2019 interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. Furthermore, our owned and in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on our products, product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technology in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. In addition, some jurisdictions, such as Europe, Japan, and China, may have a higher standard for patentability than in the United States, including for example the requirement of claims having literal support in the original patent filing and the limitation on using supporting data that is not in the original patent filing. Under those heightened patentability requirements, we may not be able to obtain sufficient patent protection in certain jurisdictions even though the same or similar patent protection can be secured in United States and other jurisdictions.\nProceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such\npatent. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned or licensed patents and applications. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees due to U.S. and non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-United States government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the America Invents Act) enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before we do could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensor\u2019s patents or patent applications.\nThe America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nIssued patents covering Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad.\nIf we or one of our licensors initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering Phexxi or other proprietary technologies we may develop, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our owned or in-licensed patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of, or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or our licensing partners and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we do not obtain PTE for our products or product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nOne or more of our owned or in-licensed U.S. patents covering Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, and depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea and any other product candidate we may develop, may be eligible for limited PTE under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a PTE of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar patent term restoration provisions to compensate for commercialization delay caused by regulatory review are also available in certain foreign jurisdictions, such as in Europe under Supplemental Protection Certificate (SPC).\nAn important part of our patent strategy is reliant on our or Rush University\u2019s ability to obtain PTE on the U.S. patent licensed from Rush University, which currently expires in March 2023. Rush University submitted a PTE application for the U.S. patent in 2020 requesting a five-year PTE to 2026. Two OGIEs were received from the USPTO, extending the expiration of the U.S. patent to 2023. However, we may not be granted a full five-year PTE for the U.S. patent or similar extension outside the United States, such as SPC for the European patents because of, for example, our inability to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, our inability to apply within applicable deadlines, our inability to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or if we are otherwise unable to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than our or Rush University\u2019s request. If we or Rush University are unable to obtain PTE or the term of any such extension is shorter than what we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for our product candidates are dependent on third parties, including Rush University.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the patents relating to our products and product candidates, there may be times, such as with respect to our agreement with Rush University, when the filing and prosecution activities for patents relating to our products or product candidates are controlled by our licensors or collaboration partners. If any of our current or future licensing or collaboration partners fail to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents and patent applications in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business, including by payment of all applicable fees for patents covering our products or product candidates, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, our ability to develop and commercialize Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy and Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, if approved may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. In addition, even where we have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications we have licensed to and from third parties, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensees, our licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the date upon which we assumed control over patent prosecution.\nIf an event of default occurs under our issued and outstanding secured convertible notes issued pursuant to the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement, the noteholders could take possession of all assets owned by us, including any directly owned intellectual property.\nIn connection with the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement, we executed a Security Agreement in favor of the designated agent of the noteholders granting a security interest in all of our owned assets, whether currently owned or later acquired. If an event of default, including a default arising from our inability to pay any amounts due, occurs under the Baker Bros. Purchase Agreement or under the convertible notes, the designated agent of these noteholders has the right to take possession of all of our assets.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our products or product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensor\u2019s ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our products, product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking and maintaining patents for Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop, we also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information and to maintain our competitive position. With respect to Phexxi, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be one of our important sources of intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, our trade secrets and know-how in connection with Phexxi and other proprietary technology we may develop over time may be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel with scientific positions in academic and industry.\nWe seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that third parties have an ownership interest in our trade secrets. For example, we may have disputes arise from conflicting obligations of our employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our products and product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging ownership of our trade secrets. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, it may lose valuable trade secret rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, trade secrets that are important to a product candidate and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to any product candidate we may develop through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have rights to intellectual property covering Phexxi. Other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions may also have filed or are planning to file patent applications potentially relevant to our business. To avoid infringing these third-party patents, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses to such patents from such third-party intellectual property holders. However, we may be unable to secure such licenses or otherwise acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow it to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development or commercialization of the relevant program, product or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that it regards as its own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, induced intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us or our collaborators may prevent or delay the development and commercialization of our products, product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop.\nThe contraceptive and/or STI prevention market is competitive and dynamic. Due to the significant research and development activities that are taking place by several companies in this field, including us and our competitors, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain in the future. There may be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings relating to our owned and in-licensed and other third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights in the future.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to avoid infringing, inducing infringement, misappropriating and otherwise violating the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of complex litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. As discussed above, recently, due to changes in U.S. law referred to as patent reform, new procedures including inter partes review and post-grant review have been implemented. As stated above, this reform adds uncertainty to the possibility of challenge to our patents in the future.\nNumerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we intend to commercialize Phexxi and in which we are developing other proprietary technologies. As the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidate may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. We cannot assure you that Phexxi and other proprietary technologies we may develop will not infringe existing or future patents owned by third parties. We may not be aware of patents that have already been issued and that a third party, for example, a competitor in the fields in which we are commercializing or developing our products or product candidates, might assert are infringed by our current or future product candidates, including claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of use or treatment that cover our product candidates. It is also possible that patents owned by third parties of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our products, product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop, could be found to be infringed by our products or product candidate. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our products or product candidate may infringe.\nThird parties may currently have patents or obtain patents in the future and may claim that use of our technology or the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates infringes upon these patents. In the event a third party claims we infringed their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates litigation against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that such patents are valid, enforceable and infringed by our technology, products or product candidates. In this case, the holders of such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable product candidate or technology unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to commercialize our products, product candidates or technology or such commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business.\nDefense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be enjoined from further developing or commercializing our infringing products or technology. In addition, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties and/or redesign our infringing products or technology, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product, product candidates or technology, which could harm our business significantly. Further, we cannot predict whether any required license would be available at all or whether we would be available on commercially reasonable terms. In the event we could not obtain a license, we may be unable to further develop our product, product candidates and commercialize our product and product candidates, if approved, which could harm our business significantly. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations such as the commercialization of Phexxi, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter licenses on acceptable terms.\nEngaging in litigation defending us against third parties alleging infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course, we have been and again may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or other third parties may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensing partners. We have and may again be required to defend against claims of infringement or otherwise engage in legal action to protect our intellectual property. Any commercial success we may achieve with Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy may incentivize third parties to challenge or infringe our intellectual property. In addition, our patents or the patents of our licensing partners also may become involved in inventorship, priority or validity disputes. To counter or defend against these claims is expensive and time consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide a patent owned or in-licensed by us is invalid or unenforceable,\nor may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds our owned and in-licensed patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our owned or in-licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. These litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nSome intellectual property that we have in-licensed may have been discovered through government funded programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for U.S.-based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nIntellectual property rights we have licensed or may in the future license are generated through the use of U.S. government funding and are therefore subject to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current product or our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act) and implementing regulations. These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d). The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we, or the applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. These time limits have recently been changed by regulation, and may change in the future. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names have in the ordinary course of our business been challenged and may again be challenged by third parties. For example, we are party to TherapeuticsMD, Inc. v. Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida-West Palm Beach Division). While we do not believe the claims in this trademark dispute have merit or are material, there can be no assurance that we will prevail and the dispute has caused management to expend significant time and human resources in managing it. These trademarks and tradenames may also be infringed, circumvented or may not be registered with the USPTO or determined to be infringing on other marks. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections of our applications by the USPTO or in other foreign jurisdictions. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Moreover, any name we have proposed to use with our product or product candidates in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless\nof whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. Similar requirements exist in Europe. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. Furthermore, in many countries, owning and maintaining a trademark registration may not provide an adequate defense against a subsequent infringement claim asserted by the owner of a senior trademark.\nWe may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, we may be subject to potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names or that allege we have infringed on their trademarks and trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to defend ourselves in suits related to our trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022others may be able to make products that are similar to our products or product candidates or utilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own;\n\u2022we, or our current or future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we license or may own in the future;\n\u2022we, or our current or future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technology without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our current or future pending owned or licensed patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors or other third parties;\n\u2022our competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022the patents of others may harm our business; and\n\u2022we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nOur success relies on third-party suppliers and one contract manufacturer. Any failure by these third parties, including their inability to successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, could negatively impact our business and our ability to develop and market our products or product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have a small number of employees and no internal manufacturing capability. Our management does not expect to manufacture any products and expects to rely solely on third parties to manufacture our products, including our FDA-approved commercial product Phexxi, and as such we will be subject to inherent uncertainties related to product safety, availability and\nsecurity. While, as of December 31, 2021, we estimated that we would have sufficient manufactured Phexxi inventory on hand to support approximately fifteen months of expected demand for Phexxi, this estimate could ultimately be incorrect and our inventory needs may increase more than we currently expect thus increasing our expected reliance on our third-party suppliers. We currently have only one contract manufacturer for drug product, DPT Laboratories, Ltd. (DPT), who we entered into a supply and manufacturing agreement with in November 2019 (the Manufacturing Agreement). Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, subject only to a supply failure, we are obligated to purchase all of our requirements with respect to Phexxi from DPT. We expect to rely on DPT to increase the manufacturing of Phexxi in amounts needed to support commercialization. If DPT does not perform as agreed or is unable to increase manufacturing of Phexxi as needed to support commercialization, including as a result of being adversely affected by COVID-19, or terminates our agreement, we will be required to replace them as our manufacturer, and we may be unable to do so on a timely basis, on similar terms or at all. Furthermore, we have only a single source of supply for some of the key raw materials and components of Phexxi, and while we believe we would be able to obtain supplies through alternative sources if needed, alternate sources of supply may not be readily available and alternate sources of supply may also be affected by COVID-19.\nMoreover, we do not control the manufacturing processes for the production of Phexxi, which must be made in accordance with relevant regulations including, among other things, quality control, quality assurance, compliance with cGMP and the maintenance of records and documentation. In the future, it is possible that our suppliers or manufacturers may fail to comply with FDA regulations, the requirements of other regulatory bodies or our own requirements, any of which would result in suspension or prevention of commercialization and/or manufacturing of our products or product candidates, including Phexxi; suspension of ongoing research; disqualification of data or other enforcement actions such as product recall, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions against us. Furthermore, we may be unable to replace any supplier or manufacturer with an alternate supplier or manufacturer on a commercially reasonable or timely basis, or at all.\nIf we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of, or if any supplier or manufacturer were unable to meet our demand for Phexxi or our product candidates, we could experience delays in research, planned clinical trials and/or commercialization. We might be unable to find alternative suppliers or manufacturers with FDA approval, of acceptable quality, and that are able to supply products/ingredients in the appropriate volumes and at an acceptable cost. The long transition periods necessary to switch manufacturers and suppliers would significantly delay our timelines, including our commercialization timeline, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, our reliance on DPT, and potential future third-party manufacturers, exposes us to the following additional risks:\n\u2022we may be unable to identify other manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022our third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u2022DPT and potential future third-party manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures appropriately;\n\u2022our future third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products;\n\u2022manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, and we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u2022we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product or product candidates; and\n\u2022our third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or the continued availability of Phexxi or could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we rely on third parties to perform release testing on our products and product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm, which could result in product liability suits.\nThe manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, timely availability of raw materials, lot consistency, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product or product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot be assured that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our products or product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized and our ability to distribute any approved products would be harmed. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies, could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. There is no assurance that our manufacturer will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process for Phexxi or other product candidates that achieves our objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost of goods. There is no assurance that our manufacturers will be able to manufacture or continue to manufacture any approved products, including Phexxi, to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. Any delay or failure in the production of any approved products would impair our ability to commercialize and obtain revenue from these products. These circumstances would materially harm our business, results of operations, financial conditions and prospects.\nWe have no significant internal distribution capabilities. We intend to engage third-party distributors for distribution of products outside the United States, if approved, and have engaged additional third-party wholesale distributors for the distribution of Phexxi in the United States. Our inability to identify, or enter into an agreement with, any such third-party distributor, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIf we are unable to engage additional wholesale distributors and/or maintain our relationship with our wholesale distributors within the United States for Phexxi, our domestic commercialization activities may be disrupted. If we are able to identify and enter into a strategic relationship with one or more third party collaborators for the development of Phexxi outside of the United States, we intend to work with that third party or third parties to obtain marketing approval for Phexxi in each relevant jurisdiction and to enter into distribution agreements with such third party or parties for distribution of Phexxi in each relevant jurisdiction outside the United States. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into any such additional wholesale distribution agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that we will be able to identify any third party collaborators for the development and commercialization of Phexxi outside the United States or that we will be able to enter into any such distribution agreement with any such third party for the distribution of Phexxi outside the United States. For our current distribution agreements and for any future distribution agreements we may enter into, we would be subject to uncertainties related to such distribution services, including the quality of such distribution services. For example, distributors may not have the capacity to supply sufficient product if demand increases rapidly. Further, we would be dependent on the distributors to ensure that the distribution process accords with applicable foreign and U.S. regulations, which include, among other things, compliance with current good documentation practices, the maintenance of certain records, and compliance with other regulations, including, without limitation, the FCPA and the DSCSA in the United States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant remedial action, including enforcement action requiring distributors to implement physical changes or improvements to their facilities, suspension of distribution or recall product. Additionally, any failure by us to forecast demand for finished product, including Phexxi, and failure by us to ensure our distributors have appropriate capacity to distribute such quantities of finished product, could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in sales of that product. If we grant any such third-party distributor the right to manufacture any applicable product, we would also be subject to the risk factors set forth above with respect to third-party manufacturing of our product as well as the requirement to have any such additional manufacturer pre-approved by FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities. Further, third-party distributors may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. Any significant problem or disruption that our distributors experience, including any disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could delay or interrupt our sale of products in the applicable jurisdiction until the applicable distributor cures the problem or until we identify and negotiate an acceptable agreement with an alternative distributor, if one is available. Due to the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to find any alternative distributor. Any failure or delay in distributing products would likely have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nWe rely and intend to rely on third parties for the execution of our development programs for our product candidates and for the delivery of telehealth services through the Phexxi telehealth platform. Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality, in accordance with applicable regulations and within acceptable time frames may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.\nWe employ a business model that relies on the outsourcing of certain functions, tests and services to CROs, medical institutions and other specialist providers, including, without limitation, the conduct, management and monitoring of our ongoing and planned clinical trials. As a result, we rely on these third parties for, among other things, quality assurance, clinical monitoring, clinical data management and regulatory expertise. We also intend to engage a CRO for all future clinical trial requirements needed to file for regulatory approvals. There is no assurance that such organizations or individuals will be able to provide the functions, tests or services as agreed upon, or to the requisite quality. We will rely on the efforts of these organizations and individuals and could suffer significant delays in the development of our product or processes should they fail to perform as expected.\nThere is also no assurance that these third parties will not make errors in, or simply fail to be effective in, the design, management or retention of our data or data systems. Any failures by such third parties could lead to a loss of data or data integrity, which in turn could lead to delays in clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval. Third parties may not pass FDA or other regulatory audits, which could delay or prohibit regulatory approval. In addition, the cost of such services could significantly increase over time. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, regulatory approval of our current or any future product candidates may be delayed, prevented or cost significantly more than expected, all which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Phexxi telehealth platform is designed to provide physicians with on-demand educational support, and to remove certain barriers to women\u2019s access to Phexxi by removing the need for an in-office visit. With the Phexxi telehealth platform, women can directly meet with an HCP to determine their eligibility for a Phexxi prescription and potentially have it written by the HCP, filled, and mailed directly to them by a third-party pharmacy. These telehealth platform services are not core to our business of developing and commercializing innovative products to address unmet needs in women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health. These services are also subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations and professional practice standards, and we do not have the resources to provide these telehealth services internally. Any pharmacy that fills Phexxi prescriptions will be fully independent from us. We do not control or own or possess any ownership stake in any pharmacy that we expect may fill prescriptions for Phexxi or in any telehealth service provider. All prescriptions will be routed through our independent third-party telehealth service providers. If our telehealth service providers fail to perform or fail to perform in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards of care, our business, financial condition, commercial launch of Phexxi and results of operation would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to enter into or maintain strategic relationships or collaborations with respect to Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy or for our future product candidates, or if we are unable to realize the potential benefits from such collaborations, our business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not presently expect to commercialize Phexxi, assuming international marketing approval is obtained, outside of the United States unless we enter into a strategic relationship or collaboration with a third party. If we are successful in identifying and in-licensing the rights to additional product candidates, our expected strategy with respect to the development of any such future product candidates is to supplement internal efforts with third-party collaborations. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming arrangements to negotiate and document.\nOur success in entering into a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend upon, among other things, our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design and outcomes of the clinical trials, the collaborator\u2019s history of regulatory compliance, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the product, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such products to customers, the potential of competing products, the strength of the intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative products or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on with one of our competitors and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our products or product candidates.\nAny potential collaboration agreement into which we might enter may call for licensing or cross-licensing of potentially blocking patents, know-how or other intellectual property. Due to the potential overlap of data, know-how and\nintellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that one of our collaborators will not dispute our right to use, license or distribute such data, know-how or other intellectual property rights, and this may potentially lead to disputes, liability or termination of the collaboration.\nWe may also be restricted under existing and future collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators and may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product, reduce or delay our development program, delay commercialization, reduce the scope of sales or marketing activities, or increase expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Absent sufficient funds, we may not be able to commercialize a product candidate. If we enter into a collaboration agreement regarding a product or product candidate, we could be subject to, among other things, the following risks, each of which may materially harm our business, commercialization prospects and financial condition:\n\u2022we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that the collaborator devotes to the product development program;\n\u2022we may experience financial difficulties and thus not commit sufficient financial resources to the product development program;\n\u2022we may be required to relinquish important rights to the collaborator such as marketing, distribution and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022a collaborator could move forward with a competing product developed either independently or in collaboration with third parties, including our competitors;\n\u2022a collaborator could terminate the agreement either for convenience, if permitted, or for our breach; or\n\u2022business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect our willingness to complete our obligations under any arrangement.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product or product candidates. In addition, actions taken by a collaborator within its licensed territory, many of which we may not be able to control, could negatively impact our development or commercialization of the product or product candidate in the United States.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we must perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into or will enter into manufacturing, distribution, wholesale, academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to our academic and other research agreements, including the Rush License Agreement, we typically indemnify the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which we have secured licenses, and from claims arising from our or our sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to collaboration agreements, we may have to indemnify our collaborators from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right owned by a third party. With respect to consultants, we indemnify them from claims arising from performance of their services in accordance with legal and contractual requirements.\nIf our obligations under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we were denied insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Commercialization of Health Care Products\nPhexxi and any other approved product may face follow-on competition sooner than anticipated.\nAlthough Phexxi vaginal gel is FDA-approved for commercialization in the United States, it and any of our product candidates that may achieve regulatory approval in the future may face competition from generic products earlier or more aggressively than anticipated, depending upon how well such approved products perform in the United States prescription drug market. In addition to creating the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to ANDAs. An ANDA relies on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously approved RLD, and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also that it is \u201cbioequivalent\u201d to the RLD. The FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA when certain marketing or data exclusivity protections apply to the RLD. If any such competitor or third party is able to demonstrate bioequivalence without infringing our patents, then this competitor or third party may then be able to introduce a competing generic product onto the market.\nPhexxi is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and has been granted three years of data exclusivity that expires on May 22, 2023, and it has been designated as an RLD by the FDA. As such, the three-year exclusivity period should block FDA from approving either a subsequent ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that relies in whole or in part on our protected clinical data. We cannot predict the interest of potential follow-on competitors in the future Phexxi market, whether someone will attempt to invalidate our period of exclusivity or otherwise force the FDA to take other actions, or how quickly others may seek to come to market with competing products after the three-year data exclusivity period ends. Future product candidates may also receive marketing exclusivity under the FDCA after approval that may similarly be subject to challenge or uncertainty.\nIf the FDA approves generic versions of our products, it could negatively impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on our investments in those product candidates.\nChanges in health care laws and regulations may eliminate current requirements for health insurance plans to cover and reimburse FDA-cleared or FDA-approved contraceptive products without cost sharing, which could reduce demand for products such as Phexxi. Our management expects our success will be dependent on the willingness or ability of patients to pay out-of-pocket for Phexxi should they not be able to obtain third-party reimbursement or should such reimbursement be limited.\nWe cannot be certain that third-party reimbursement will remain available for Phexxi vaginal gel for the prevention of pregnancy, or if reimbursement is available, that the amount of any such reimbursement would not change. We provide a financial assistance program for Phexxi patients to offset any co-pay or patient out of pocket costs, but we do not know if this program will be successful in increasing market acceptance or that such program will not prove to be prohibitively costly. Demand for Phexxi may decrease if we elect to discontinue our co-pay programs. The ACA and subsequent regulations enacted by the DHHS require, under certain conditions, health plans to provide coverage for women\u2019s preventive care, including all forms of FDA-cleared or FDA-approved contraception, without imposing any cost sharing on the plan beneficiary. These regulations ensure that women who wish to use an approved form of contraception may request it from their doctors and their health insurance plan must cover all costs associated with such products, under certain conditions. In January 2022, the DHHS, Department of Labor, and Treasury Department jointly issued guidance on implementation of this ACA mandate, among other things. The recently issued federal guidance makes clear that all FDA-approved or cleared contraceptive products that are determined by an individual\u2019s medical provider to be medically appropriate for such individual must be covered without-cost sharing, regardless of whether the product is specifically identified in the FDA\u2019s Birth Control Guide.\nHowever, certain members of Congress and other stakeholders may attempt to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA and corresponding regulations, as more fully described below, which could eliminate the requirement for health plans to cover women\u2019s preventive care without cost sharing. Even if the ACA is not repealed, the DHHS regulations to specifically enforce the preventive health coverage mandate could be repealed or modified; for example, the Trump administration in 2017 altered the mandate to allow certain employers and insurers to opt-out of birth control coverage for religious or moral reasons, which was partially upheld by the Supreme Court in July 2020. The DHHS, Department of Labor, and Treasury Department are expected to initiate rulemaking in 2022 that would amend existing regulations to account for recent litigation. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rule making or changes in the law. Any repeal or elimination of the preventive care coverage rules would mean that women seeking to use prescribed forms of contraceptives may have to pay some portion of the cost for such products out-of-pocket, which could deter some women from using prescription contraceptive products, such as Phexxi, at all. We expect that health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for Phexxi or any of our product candidates, if approved. Even if we obtain coverage for any approved products, the resulting reimbursement\npayment rates might not be adequate or may require a co-pay that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use any products we may market unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of those products. As a result, we expect that our success, to some degree, will be dependent on the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for Phexxi in the event that their third-party payer either does not cover and reimburse Phexxi or requires payment of a portion of Phexxi by the patient, thus increasing the patient\u2019s overall cost to use Phexxi. This could reduce market demand for Phexxi or any future product candidates we may seek to develop, if and when they receive FDA approval, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and prospects.\nWe may also experience pressure from payers as well as state and federal government authorities concerning certain promotional approaches that we may implement such as our co-pay programs. Certain state and federal enforcement authorities and members of Congress have initiated inquiries about co-pay programs. Some state legislatures have been considering proposals that would restrict or ban co-pay coupons. For example, legislation was recently signed into law in California that would limit the use of co-pay coupons in cases where a lower cost generic drug is available and if individual ingredients in combination therapies are available over the counter at a lower cost. It is possible that similar legislation could be proposed and enacted in additional states. If we are unsuccessful with or discontinue our co-pay programs, or we are unable to secure adequate coverage from third-party payers, we may experience financial pressure which would have a material adverse effect on our business and make it difficult to commercialize successfully.\nDespite FDA-approval for Phexxi and even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market other product candidates in the United States, revenues may be adversely affected if Phexxi or any other the product does not obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers in the United States.\nMarket acceptance and sales of Phexxi vaginal gel or any other product candidates that we may seek to commercialize will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payers, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payers decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payers in the United States often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product or product candidates that we develop will be made on a payer-by-payer basis. One payer\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payer\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.\nThird-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical and medical device products, including Phexxi. The U.S. government and other third-party payers are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and medical devices, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Coverage decisions can depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. We may incur significant costs to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our future products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the necessary FDA marketing approvals. Third-party payer coverage may not be available to patients for Phexxi or any future product we may seek to commercialize. If third-party payers do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for Phexxi or our other product candidates, if approved, HCPs may not prescribe them or patients may ask their HCPs to prescribe competing products with more favorable reimbursement.\nManaged care organizations and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. Consolidation among managed care organizations has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payers increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Phexxi or any future product we may seek to commercialize, or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing levels, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nThe pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly regulated and subject to various fraud and abuse, data privacy, transparency, and other health care laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. Federal False Claims Act and the FCPA.\nHCPs and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products and medical devices that are granted marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with health care professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payers, customers and other organizations may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other health care laws and regulations in the United States. These regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private individuals through civil whistleblower or qui tams actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022HIPAA which, among other things, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program and making false statements relating to health care matters;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain covered HCPs, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as defined by such law, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022foreign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to HCPs and other potential referral sources; state laws that require product manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other HCPs or marketing expenditures; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may conflict, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Notably, in November 2020, DHHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the health care industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants. Regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks may be increased where there are evolving interpretations of applicable regulatory requirements, such as those applicable to manufacturer co-pay programs. Pharmaceutical manufacturer co-pay programs, including pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations, are the subject of ongoing litigation, enforcement actions and settlements (involving other manufacturers and to which we are not a party) and evolving interpretations of applicable regulatory requirements and certain state laws, and any change in the regulatory or enforcement environment regarding such programs could impact our ability to offer such programs. In addition, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with these laws will involve substantial costs. Any investigation of us or the third parties with whom we contract, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages,\nmonetary fines, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion and debarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, debarment under the FDCA, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nHealth care legislative reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product or product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAmong policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, Congress passed the ACA, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drug products covered under Medicare Part B report the product\u2019s ASP to DHHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.\nThere remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA\u2019s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other health care reform measures, especially with regard to health care access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the U.S.\nAdditionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.\nThe uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Medicare sequester reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011 will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to provisions of the CARES Act which also extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The suspension was subsequently extended through March 31, 2022, with a reduction of the suspension to 1% sequester through June 30, 2022.\nIn addition, in 2013, the DSCSA enacted imposed obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the CREATES Act. The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic\nand biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. The CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on \u201ccommercially reasonable, market-based terms.\u201d Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. Other legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are unsure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or whether such changes will have any impact on our business.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices considering the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, state legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that federal law does not preempt the states\u2019 ability to regulate PBMs or other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.\nAt the federal level, DHHS has solicited feedback on various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS\u2019s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. In addition, in 2020, the FDA finalized a rulemaking to establish a system whereby state governmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada. The Biden Administration, which assumed control of the Executive Branch on January 20, 2021, has also indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority. For example, in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and health care insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directs the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following on the Trump administration notice-and-comment rulemaking on Canadian drug importation finalized in October 2020). The Biden order also called on DHHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by DHHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing DHHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions. The implementation of cost containment measures or other health care reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nCurrent and future health care legislation could have a significant impact on our business. There is uncertainty with respect to the impact these changes, if any, may have, and any changes likely will take time to unfold. In addition, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Any additional federal or state health care reform measures could limit the amounts that third-party payers will pay for health care products and services, and, in turn, could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.\nWe may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe and our third-party service providers are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. In the United States, we and our third-party service providers may be subject to state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protections laws which impose requirements for the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information. These laws overlap and often conflict and each of these laws are subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our third-party service providers. In particular, our Phexxi telehealth platform and our online, digital and media marketing strategies are required to comply with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain information that is protected by HIPAA (protected health information) from a covered entity or business associate in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting a violation of HIPAA.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security, data collection, and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of health, personal information, and financial information of our customers, clinical subjects, clinical investigators, employees, and vendors/business contacts. For example, California has implemented the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act that imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information, and California has recently adopted the CCPA, which went into effect in January of 2020. The CCPA mirrors a number of the key provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) described below. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), was a ballot measure approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020, and certain provisions are effective as of January 1, 2022 with full effectiveness as of January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies and expands the CCPA significantly, and among other things, creates the California Privacy Protection Agency with full administrative power, authority and jurisdiction to implement and enforce CCPA. CPRA transferred rulemaking authority from the California attorney General to the California Privacy Protection Agency effective July 1, 2021 with final CPRA regulations due by July 1, 2022. CPRA enforcement will begin July 1, 2023. The CCPA creates the potential for further uncertainty, additional costs and expenses in the Company\u2019s efforts to comply with California privacy requirements and additional potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. Virginia and Colorado enacted similar data protection laws in 2021, and other U.S. states have proposals under consideration, increasing the regulatory compliance risk.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations.\nOn May 25, 2018, the GDPR went into effect, implementing a broad data protection framework that expanded the scope of EU data protection law, including to non-EU entities that process, or control the processing of, personal data relating to individuals located in the EU, including clinical trial data. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of EU based data subjects, including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be \u201cforgotten\u201d and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g. access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and a new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as \u201cspecial category\u201d data under the GDPR and afford greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Further, EU member states have a broad right to impose additional conditions-including restrictions-on these data categories. This is because the GDPR allows EU member states to derogate from the requirements of the GDPR mainly in regard to specific processing situations (including special category data and processing for scientific or statistical purposes). As the EU states continue to reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant EU member states\u2019 laws and regulations, including where permitted derogation from the GDPR are introduced.\nWe will also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export if we transfer data outside the EU to ourselves or third parties. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the EU where there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard personal data (e.g. the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18) (Schrems II). This decision calls into question certain data transfer mechanisms as between the EU member states and the US. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data importers to assess U.S. national security laws on their business future actions of EU data protection authorities are difficult to predict at the early date. Consequently, there is some risk of any data transfers from the EU being halted. If we have to rely on third parties to carry out services for us, including processing personal data on our behalf, we are required under GDPR to enter into contractual arrangements to help ensure that these third parties only process such data according to our instructions and have sufficient security measures in place. Any security breach or non-compliance with our contractual terms or breach of applicable law by such third parties could result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause customers to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse impact on our reputation and business. Any contractual arrangements requiring the processing of personal data from the EU to us in the United States will require greater scrutiny and assessments as required under Schrems II and may have an adverse impact on cross-border transfers of personal data or increase costs of compliance. The GDPR provides an enforcement authority to impose large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. We will be subject to GDPR when we have a EU presence or \"establishment\" (e.g. EU based subsidiary or\noperations), when conducting clinical trials with EU based data subjects, whether the trials are conducted directly by us or through a vendor or partner, or offering approved products or services to EU based data subjects, regardless of whether involving a EU based subsidiary or operations.\nApplicable data privacy and data protection laws may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction, we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future. If we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us, we may be required to pay significant fines and penalties, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be forced to change the way we operate. That could require us to incur significant expenses, which could significantly affect our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from political instability (including workforce uncertainty), trade disputes between nations and the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For example, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, we may be unable to pass through price increases to patients. The cost of importing similar products from foreign markets may affect our sales in any domestic market.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payers and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our product if, and when approved. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our current or potential future third-party manufacturers, sole source or single source suppliers, licensors or licensees to remain in business, or otherwise manufacture or supply our product candidate. Failure by any of them to remain in business could affect our ability to manufacture Phexxi or any of our future product candidates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect the macroeconomic factors and the credit markets in a manner that is detrimental to our business. Moreover, some physician offices appear to be negatively impacted by restrictions on elective procedures and office visits related to the pandemic. To the extent physician offices are again closed or visits are again reduced, patients could be less likely to be prescribed Phexxi. Even with our planned telehealth efforts through efforts such as the Phexxi telehealth platform, we may not be able to effectively commercialize Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy as a result of our reduced sales force, any reduction in physician office visits and other circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic may continue to adversely affect us and our business in manner we may be unable to reliably predict or quantify.\nAlso, as a result of the current geopolitical tensions and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the recent invasion by Russia of Ukraine, the governments of the United States, European Union, Japan and other jurisdictions have recently announced the imposition of sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries. These and any additional sanctions and export controls, as well as any counter responses by the governments of Russia or other jurisdictions, could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the global supply chain, with negative implications on the availability and prices of raw materials, energy prices, and our customers, as well as the global financial markets and financial services industry.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nAs we mature and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to expand the size of our organization. If we experience difficulties in managing this growth or are unable to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products, develop any product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.\nAs of February 28, 2022, we had a total of 119 employees, all of which are full-time employees. In addition, we used third-party consultants to assist with research and development activities, including regulatory filings and clinical trial operations and support, sales and marketing research and programs, as well as general and administrative activities. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies continue to develop, we expect that we will expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, regulatory affairs and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities, which would lead to disruptions in our operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish, or that our staffing levels may turn out to be too robust for our actual business activity.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial and key personnel. We are highly dependent on our senior management, and the loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could impede, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product or product candidates, hurt our ability to raise additional funds and negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, we might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be harmed as a result. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals.\nWe might not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, medical device, biopharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Diego area where we are headquartered. As a result, we may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts, including the grant of significant equity incentive awards which would be dilutive to stockholders. Many of the other companies within the contraceptive industry with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives or if we are not able to effectively manage any future growth, we may experience constraints that will harm our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business objectives.\nOur current or future employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with legal requirements or regulatory standards.\nWe may become exposed to the risk of employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners or vendors engaging in fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors could include intentional conduct such as failures: (i) to comply with FDA or other regulators\u2019 regulations; (ii) to provide accurate information to such regulators; or (iii) to comply with manufacturing standards established by us and/or required by law. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws, regulations and industry guidance intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by current or future employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory or civil sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant adverse impact on our business and we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe may be vulnerable to disruption, damage and financial obligations as a result of information technology system failures, cybersecurity breaches, loss of data or other disruptions that could compromise our proprietary information or other sensitive information.\nDespite the implementation of security measures and internal policies and controls, any of the internal computer systems belonging to us or our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, malicious attack, human error, and telecommunication and electrical failure. Cybersecurity risks continue to increase for our industry, including for our third party vendors, who may hold some of our data, and the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the actors behind such attacks present risks for compromised or lost data, which could result in substantial costs and harm to our reputation. Any system failure, accident, security breach or data breach that causes interruptions in our own or in third-party service vendors\u2019 operations could result in a material disruption of our commercialization or product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from future clinical trials could result in liability, delays in our or our partners\u2019 regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the lost data. Further, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, our commercialization of Phexxi is partially reliant on the use of the Phexxi telehealth platform and our other digital or media marketing strategies. We are in turn reliant on third parties and limited internal\nresources to ensure the Phexxi telehealth platform and these other digital and marketing resources function appropriately. Our commercialization of Phexxi may be adversely affected to the extent the Phexxi telehealth platform and our other online marketing resources do not work properly or are disrupted. To the extent any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, sensitive information or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur resulting liability and reputation damage, our product development programs and competitive position may be adversely affected and the further commercialization or development of our products may be delayed. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches and these costs could be significant.\nThe United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related to the collection, use, and dissemination of data. Some of these federal, state and foreign government requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals and others of security breaches involving health information or particular personally identifiable information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or by our vendors, contractors, or organizations with which we have formed strategic relationships. Even though we may have contractual protections with such vendors, contractors, or other organizations, notifications and follow-up actions related to a security breach could impact our reputation, cause us to incur significant costs, including legal expenses, harm customer confidence, hurt our expansion into new markets, cause us to incur remediation costs, or cause us to lose existing customers.\nThe techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated or remote areas of the world. For example, there may be an increased risk of cybersecurity attacks by state actors due to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Recently, Russian ransomware gangs have threatened to increase hacking activity against critical infrastructure of any nation or organization that retaliates against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Any such increase in such attacks on our third-party provider or other systems could adversely affect our network systems or other operations. We may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. There can be no assurance that we will promptly detect any such disruption or security breach, if at all. If our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, reputational harm, litigation and enforcement actions, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, the loss of data from clinical trials for our drug or biologic candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce data and a cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our reputation and could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of our internal operations, increased cyber security protection costs, lost revenues or litigation. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nAny such security breach may compromise information stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information, it may also subject us to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with certain privacy and security laws. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. A cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our reputation and could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of our internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenue or litigation.\nWe expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur and expect to continue to incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses in relation to our status as a public reporting company. Now that we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect these expenses will further increase. We may need to hire additional accounting, finance and other personnel in connection with our continuing efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWhile we remain a smaller reporting company and have revenues of less than $100 million per year, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. If and when we are required to achieve compliance with regulatory auditor attestation report requirements within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service of key management, advisors and other specialized personnel, including Saundra Pelletier, our Chief Executive Officer; Justin J. File, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alex Fitzpatrick, our General Counsel who are all employed at will and for whom we do not have \u201ckey man\u201d insurance coverage. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our commercialization efforts and research and development programs and could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in women\u2019s health care, drug development, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations (many of whom have substantially greater financial resources than us), and we might not be able to attract or retain these key employees on conditions that are economically acceptable. Our inability to attract and retain these key employees could prevent us from achieving our objectives and implementing our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, medical epidemics or pandemics, or other natural disasters. These natural disasters may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change.\nOur principal offices are located in our facilities in San Diego, California. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics or pandemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents, including the COVID-19 pandemic, that results in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, effects the ability of our employees working remotely to communicate with us and our systems, or that affects the operations of our third party manufacturers, distributors, service providers or consultants may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. These natural events may become worse over time due to the ongoing effects of climate change. Any business interruption may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur shares of common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market which could result in, among other things, a decline in the price of our common stock and less liquidity for holders of shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum $1.00 per share bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to the Bid Price Requirement. The closing bid price for our common stock must remain at or above $1.00 per share to comply with the Bid Price Requirement for continued listing. Since July 12, 2021, the closing bid price for our common stock has been below $1.00 per share. On August 23, 2021, we received a deficiency letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us, that, for the preceding 30 consecutive trading days, the closing bid price for shares of our common stock was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement and that we had failed to comply with the Bid Price Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, we have been provided until the Compliance Date to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. We did not evidence compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date and, as a result, the Staff of Nasdaq notified us on February 22, 2022 that shares of our common stock were subject to delisting unless we timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. We timely requested a hearing, but there can be no assurance that our appeal to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel will be successful or that we will otherwise maintain compliance with any of the other Nasdaq listing requirements.\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot ensure that our common stock, if delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system. Other consequences could include: a default under our Notes, an adverse effecting on our ability to obtain equity financing at acceptable terms or at all, a negative effect on the common stock trading volume, price, and an increase in the stock volatility, and a possible loss of confidence by shareholders, employees, and business partners. As noted above, in the event of a default under our Notes, holders of our common stock may not receive the value of their investment.\nOur stock price is and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results, the timing and our ability to advance the development of our product candidates or changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations, any of which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Each of these factors, among others, could harm your investment in our securities and could result in your being unable to resell any of our securities that you purchase at a price equal to or above the price you paid.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to companies operating performance. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022the results of our efforts to commercialize Phexxi or any other approved products;\n\u2022failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs, including Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea;\n\u2022the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license product candidates or products, if any;\n\u2022actual or anticipated results from, and any delays in, any future clinical trials, as well as results of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of any product candidates we may choose to develop;\n\u2022the level of expenses related to any product candidates that we may choose to develop or clinical development programs we may choose to pursue;\n\u2022commencement or termination of any collaboration or licensing arrangement;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u2022additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022new products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u2022general economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies, wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), boycotts and other business restrictions;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022changes in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022conditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts and related debt and equity issuances;\n\u2022sales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022stockholder activism;\n\u2022any stockholder derivative actions; and\n\u2022other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nBetween January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the closing sales price of our common stock reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market ranged between $0.37 and $4.88 per share. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in companies\u2019 stock prices, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of holders of our common stock, which could adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of the Company, and may result in the interests of the holders of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock differing from those of the holders of our common stock. Any issuance of our common stock upon conversion of the Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock will cause dilution to holders of our common stock and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the holders of shares of our common stock with respect to liquidation preferences. Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive distributions out of our assets in an amount per share equal to $1,000 per share (or approximately $5 million as of October 31, 2021), before any distributions may be made on any shares of our common stock. In addition and following October 26, 2025, holders of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to request redemption of their shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock at the price of $1,000 per share. These preferential rights could result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock and the holders of our common stock. Shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock are also convertible into shares of our common stock (subject to typical beneficial ownership and Nasdaq 19.99% limitations). Shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock will cause dilution to holders of our common stock. The conversion price per share for shares of our Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock is the greater of $0.392 or the price computed as the product of 0.85 multiplied by the arithmetic average of the closing sale prices of a per share of our common stock during the five consecutive trading-day period immediately preceding the conversion date. Until late April 2022, this conversion price is subject to full ratchet adjustment for certain dilutive issuances. This conversion price and the shares issuable upon conversion of shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock may depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of shares of our Common Stock pursuant to our Equity Line of Credit, our existing stockholders will experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may go down.\nPursuant to the February 2022 Purchase Agreement, we may sell up to $50,000,000 of shares of our common stock over a 24-month period at our option and subject to certain limitations. The sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the February 2022 Purchase Agreement will have a dilutive impact on our existing stockholders. Seven Knots may resell some or all of the shares we issue to it under the February 2022 Purchase Agreement and such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, which decline could be significant.\nThe terms of the February 2022 Purchase Agreement limit the amount of shares of Common Stock we may issue to Seven Knots, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nThe February 2022 Purchase Agreement includes restrictions on our ability to sell shares of our Common Stock to Seven Knots, including, subject to specified limitations, if a sale would cause Seven Knots and its affiliates to beneficially own more than 4.99% (which Seven Knots may increase to up to 9.99% upon 61 days\u2019 prior written notice to us) of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. Sales under the February 2022 Purchase Agreement may also be limited by the exchange cap of 32,483,835 shares, which number is equal to 19.99% of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the February 2022 Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all $50.0 million of shares of Common Stock under the Equity Line of Credit. If we cannot sell the full amount of the shares that Seven Knots has committed to purchase because of these limitations, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and cash position.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the public market at any point, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Future issuances of our securities may cause additional reduction in the percentage interests of our current stockholders in the voting power, liquidation value, our book and market value, and in any future earnings. As of March 2, 2022, there were 13,494,560 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding options which have been registered on registration statements on Form S-8. Furthermore, as of March 2, 2022, there were 98,341,397 shares subject to outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock and 85,281,776 shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of our issued and outstanding convertible notes and convertible preferred stock. We have granted (or are required to grant) certain of our security holders registration rights pursuant to our agreements with these holders, including agreements requiring us to register for resale the shares of our common stock issued upon the conversion or exercise of our convertible notes and related warrants.\nThe issuance or resale of our common stock issued to our security holders upon conversion of convertible notes or upon exercise of our warrants or options could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the increase\nin the number of issued shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes or upon exercise of our warrants may have an incidental anti-takeover effect in that these additional shares could be used to dilute the stock ownership of parties seeking to obtain control of us. The resulting increased number of issued shares could discourage the possibility of, or render more difficult, certain mergers, tender offers, proxy contests or other change of control or ownership transactions.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to short selling strategies.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may attempt to drive down the market price of shares of our Common Stock. Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as \u201cdisclosed shorts\u201d) publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. Although traditionally these disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog (blogging) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company\u2019s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called \u201cresearch reports\u201d that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels than large-cap stocks, can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. These short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the United States, are not subject to certification requirements imposed by the SEC and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions or omissions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running a successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed short sellers will continue to issue such reports.\nSignificant short selling of a company\u2019s stock creates an incentive for market participants to reduce the value of that company\u2019s common stock. Short selling may lead to the placement of sell orders by short sellers without commensurate buy orders because the shares borrowed by short sellers do not have to be returned by any fixed period of time. If a significant market for short selling our common stock develops, the market price of our common stock could be significantly depressed.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC regulations. For so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we will be permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022for so long as we remain a smaller reporting company with annual revenues of less than $100 million per year and a public float value as of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter of less than $700 million, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future; capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain as a holder of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on shares of our common stock. As noted above, we are also restricted from paying dividends pursuant to our debt arrangements. Except as may be required to redeem our issued and outstanding promissory notes or shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, we currently plan to retain all our future earnings, if any, and any cash received through future financings to finance the growth and development of our business. Accordingly, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our common stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions might frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or acting by written consent other than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022permitting our board of directors to issue additional shares of our preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other changes in control;\n\u2022establishing an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022providing that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022requiring the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022We will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities, or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022We are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022We will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022The rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022We may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nIf securities analysts cease publishing research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage or cease regularly publishing reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nIt is possible that one or more of our stockholders may publicly voice opposition to our financing strategy and/or certain aspects of our corporate governance and strategy, or undertake a proxy contest to reconstitute our board. Proxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry over the last several years. If faced with a proxy contest or other type of stockholder activism, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or other type of activism which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our reputation and/or business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest or other form of stockholder activism because:\n\u2022responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees;\n\u2022perceived uncertainties as to our company and future strategic direction may result in the loss of potential financing, acquisitions, collaboration, in-licensing or other business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders.\nAny or all of these activities could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility, and could be particularly problematic as our company seeks to transition to a commercial enterprise in a challenging environment.\nWe may become a defendant in one or more stockholder derivative or class-action litigations, and any such future lawsuit may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and certain of our officers and directors may become defendants in one or more future stockholder derivative actions or other class-action lawsuits. These lawsuits would divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our ordinary business operations, and we would likely incur significant expenses associated with their defense (including, without limitation, substantial attorneys\u2019 fees and other fees of professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors who are or may become parties to such actions). If these lawsuits do arise, we may be required to pay material damages, consent to injunctions on future conduct and/or suffer other penalties, remedies or sanctions. In addition, any such future stockholder lawsuits could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to continue to develop Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea and/or to launch and commercialize Phexxi, thereby harming our ability to generate revenue. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow and, consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15075, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "EVFM"}
