{"cik": "107140", "company": "WILEY JOHN & SONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the Company\u2019s securities. The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nCautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:\nThis Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 contains certain forward-looking statements concerning the Company\u2019s operations, performance and financial condition. In addition, the Company provides forward-looking statements in other materials released to the public as well as oral forward-looking information. Statements which contain the words anticipate, expect, believes, estimate, project, forecast, plan, outlook, intend and similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements, as actual results may differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements.\nAny such forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, and are subject to change based on many important factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to (i) the level of investment in new technologies and products; (ii) subscriber renewal rates for the Company\u2019s journals; (iii) the financial stability and liquidity of journal subscription agents; (iv) the consolidation of book wholesalers and retail accounts; (v) the market position and financial stability of key retailers; (vi) the seasonal nature of the Company\u2019s education business and the impact of the used-book market; (vii) worldwide economic and political conditions; (viii) the Company\u2019s ability to protect its copyrights and other intellectual property worldwide; (ix) the ability of the Company to successfully integrate acquired operations and realize expected opportunities and (x) other factors detailed from time to time in the Company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nOperating and Administrative Costs and Expenses\nIn general, any significant increase in the costs of goods and services provided to the Company may adversely affect the Company\u2019s costs of operation. The Company has a significant investment in its employee base around the world. The Company offers competitive salaries and benefits in order to attract and retain the highly skilled workforce needed to sustain and develop new products and services required for growth. Employment and benefit costs are affected by competitive market conditions for qualified individuals, and factors such as healthcare and retirement benefit costs. The Company is a large paper purchaser, and paper prices may fluctuate significantly from time-to-time. To reduce the impact of paper price increases, the Company relies upon multiple suppliers. As of April 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s consolidated paper inventory was approximately $4.9 million and there were no outstanding multi-year supply contracts.\nProtection of Intellectual Property Rights\nA substantial portion of the Company\u2019s publications are protected by copyright, held either in the Company\u2019s name, in the name of the author of the work, or in the name of a sponsoring professional society. Such copyrights protect the Company\u2019s exclusive right to publish the work in many countries abroad for specified periods, in most cases the author\u2019s life plus 70 years, but in any event a minimum of 50 years for works published after 1978. The ability of the Company to continue to achieve its expected results depends, in part, upon the Company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property rights. The Company\u2019s results may be adversely affected by lack of legal and/or technological protections for its intellectual property in some jurisdictions and markets.\nMaintaining the Company\u2019s Reputation\nThe Company\u2019s professional customers worldwide rely upon many of the Company\u2019s publications to perform their jobs. It is imperative that the Company consistently demonstrates its ability to maintain the integrity of the information included in its publications. Adverse publicity, whether or not valid, may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s publications.\nTrade Concentration and Credit Risk\nIn the journal publishing business, subscriptions are primarily sourced through journal subscription agents who, acting as agents for library customers, facilitate ordering by consolidating the subscription orders/billings of each subscriber with various publishers. Cash is generally collected in advance from subscribers by the subscription agents and is principally remitted to the Company between the months of December and April. Although at fiscal year-end the Company had minimal credit risk exposure to these agents, future calendar-year subscription receipts from these agents are highly dependent on their financial condition and liquidity. Subscription agents account for approximately 22% of total annual consolidated revenue and no one agent accounts for more than 11% of total annual consolidated revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s non-journal subscription business is not dependent upon a single customer. Although no one non-journal customer accounts for more than 9% of total consolidated revenue and 12% of accounts receivable at April 30, 2016, the top 10 non-journal customers account for approximately 16% of total consolidated revenue and approximately 26% of accounts receivable at April 30, 2016. The Company maintains approximately $25 million of trade credit insurance, subject to certain limitations, covering balances due from certain named customers which expires in May, 2017.\nChanges in Laws and Regulations That Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company maintains operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States. The conduct of our business, including the sourcing of content, distribution, sales, marketing and advertising is subject to various laws and regulations administered by governments around the world. Changes in laws, regulations or government policies, including tax regulations and accounting standards, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nThe scientific research publishing industry generates much of its revenue from paid customer subscriptions to online and print journal content. There is debate within government, academic and library communities whether such journal content should be made available for free, immediately or following a period of embargo after publication, referred to as \u201copen access\u201d. For instance, certain governments have implemented mandates that require journal articles derived from government-funded research to be made available to the public at no cost after an embargo period. Open access can be achieved in two ways: Green, which enables authors to publish articles in subscription based journals and self-archive the author accepted version of the article for free public use after an embargo period, and Gold, which enables authors to publish their articles in journals that provide immediate free access to the article on the publisher\u2019s website following payment of an article publication fee. These mandates have the potential to put pressure on subscription-based publications. If such regulations are widely implemented the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected. To date, the majority of governments that have taken a position on Open access have favored the green model and have generally specified embargo periods of twelve months. The publishing community generally takes the view that this period should be sufficient to protect subscription revenues provided that publishers\u2019 platforms offer sufficient added value to the article. Governments in Europe have been more supportive of the gold model, which thus far is generating incremental revenue for publishers with active open access programs. A number of European administrations are showing interest in a business model which combines the purchasing of subscription content with the purchase of open access publishing for authors in their country. This development removes an element of risk by fixing revenues from that market, provided that the terms and price negotiated are acceptable.\nBusiness Transformation and Restructuring\nThe Company is transforming portions of its business from a traditional publishing model to being a global provider of content-enabled solutions with a focus on digital products and services. The acquisition of Deltak.edu, LLC (\u201cDeltak\u201d), Inscape Holdings, Inc. (\u201cInscape\u201d), Efficient Learning Systems, Inc. (\u201cELS\u201d), Profiles International (\u201cProfiles\u201d) and CrossKnowledge Group Limited (\u201cCrossKnowledge\u201d), along with the divestment of the Company\u2019s consumer publishing programs, are examples of strategic initiatives that were implemented as part of the Company\u2019s business transformation. The Company will continue to explore opportunities to develop new business models and enhance the efficiency of its organizational structure. The rapid pace and scope of change increases the risk that not all of our strategic initiatives will deliver the expected benefits within the anticipated timeframes. In addition, these efforts may somewhat disrupt the Company\u2019s business activities which could adversely affect its operating results.\nThe Company continues to restructure and realign its cost base with current and anticipated future market conditions. Significant risks associated with these actions that may impair the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated cost reductions or that may disrupt its business include delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the U.S.; decreases in employee morale; the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of key employees; and disruptions of third parties to whom we have outsourced business functions. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOutsourcing of Business Processes\nThe Company has outsourced certain business functions, principally in technology, content management and certain transactional functions, to third-party service providers to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these third-party service providers do not perform effectively, the Company may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and depending on the function involved, may experience business disruption or processing inefficiencies, all with potential adverse effects on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIntroduction of New Technologies, Products and Services\nThe Company must continue to invest in technology and other innovations to adapt and add value to its products and services to remain competitive. There are uncertainties whenever developing new products and services, and it is often possible that such new products and services may not be launched or if launched, may not be profitable or as profitable as existing products and services.\nA common trend facing each of the Company\u2019s businesses is the digitization of content and proliferation of distribution channels through the internet and other electronic means, which are replacing traditional print formats. The trend to digital content has also created contraction in the print book retail market which increases the risk of bankruptcy for certain retail customers, potentially leading to the disruption of short-term product supply to consumers as well as potential bad debt write-offs. New distribution channels, such as digital formats, the internet, online retailers and growing delivery platforms (e.g. tablets and e-readers), combined with the concentration of retailer power, present both threats and opportunities to the Company\u2019s traditional publishing models, potentially impacting both sales volumes and pricing. In addition, there is an enhanced risk associated with the illegal unauthorized replication and distribution of digital products.\nStudent Demand for Lower Cost Textbooks in Higher Education\nThe Company\u2019s Education business publishes educational content for undergraduate, graduate and advanced placement students, lifelong learners and in Australia secondary school students. Due to growing student demand for less expensive textbooks, many college bookstores, online retailers and other entities offer used or rental textbooks to students at lower prices than new textbooks. It is uncertain how such sales of lower priced textbooks will impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nFactors that Reduce Enrollment at Colleges and Universities\nEnrollment in U.S. colleges and universities can be adversely affected by many factors, including changes in government and private student loan and grant programs, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions, general decreases in family income and net worth and a perception of uncertain job prospects for recent graduates. In addition, enrollment levels at colleges and universities outside the United States are influenced by the global and local economic climate, local political conditions and other factors that make predicting foreign enrollment levels difficult. Reductions in expected levels of enrollment at colleges and universities both within and outside the United States could adversely affect demand for our higher education products.\nInformation Technology Risks\nInformation technology is a key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy and operations. As a business strategy, Wiley\u2019s technology enables the Company to provide customers with new and enhanced products and services and is critical to the Company\u2019s success in migrating from print to digital business models. Information technology is also a fundamental component of all our business processes; collecting and reporting business data; and communicating internally and externally with customers, suppliers, employees and others.\nWe are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. We are in the process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes. The implementation of this global system will occur in phases over the next several years. Implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of a new system, could result in increased costs, disruptions in operations or delays in the collection of cash from our customers, as well as have an adverse effect on our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could significantly disrupt the operations of the Company. Management has designed and implemented policies, processes and controls to mitigate risks of information technology failure and to provide security from unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, the Company has in place disaster recovery plans to maintain business continuity. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks common to most industries from inadvertent or intentional actions by employees, vendors, or malicious third-parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives. While the Company has taken steps to address these risks, there can be no assurance that a system failure, disruption or data security breach would not adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nCompetition for Market Share and Author and Society Relationships\nThe Company operates in highly competitive markets. Success and continued growth depends greatly on developing new products and the means to deliver them in an environment of rapid technological change. Attracting new authors and professional societies, while retaining our existing business relationships, are critical to our success.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk\nNon-U.S. revenues, as well as our substantial non-U.S. net assets, expose the Company\u2019s results to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. The percentage of Consolidated Revenue for fiscal year 2016 recognized in the following currencies (on an equivalent U.S. dollar basis) were: approximately 57% U.S dollar; 28% British pound sterling; 8% euro and 7% other currencies. In addition, our interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the Market Risk section of this 10-K. The Company from time-to-time uses derivative instruments to hedge such risks. Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates, inflation or other related factors affecting our business.\nChanges in Tax Legislation\nThe Company is subject to tax laws within the jurisdictions in which it does business. Changes in tax legislation could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. There have been recent proposals to reform U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on earnings outside of the U.S. This could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial results since a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s income is earned outside the U.S. In addition, the Company is subject to audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and have a material impact on the Company\u2019s net income, cash flow and financial position. See Note 12 (\u201cTax Audits\u201d) for further details on the Company\u2019s income tax audit in Germany.\nBusiness Risk in Developing, Emerging and Other Foreign Markets\nThe Company sells its products to customers in the Middle East (including Iran and Syria), Africa (including Sudan), Cuba, and other developing markets where it does not have operating subsidiaries. The Company does not own any assets or liabilities in these markets except for trade receivables. Challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets has a higher relative risk due to political instability, economic volatility, crime, terrorism, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, and other factors. In fiscal year 2016, the Company recorded revenue and net profits of $3.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to sales to Cuba, Sudan, Syria and Iran. While sales in these markets are not material to the Company\u2019s business results, adverse developments related to the risks associated with these markets may cause actual results to differ from historical and forecasted future operating results.\nThe Company has certain technology development operations in Russia related to software development and architecture, digital content production and system testing services. Due to the political instability within the region, there is the potential for future government embargos and sanctions which could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations in the area. While the Company has developed business continuity plans to address these issues, further adverse developments in the region could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nApproximately 14% of Research journal articles are sourced from authors in China. Any restrictions on exporting intellectual property could adversely affect the company\u2019s business and operating results.\nLiquidity and Global Economic Conditions\nChanges in global financial markets have not had, nor do we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. As market conditions change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position. However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity or our results of operations will not be affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions. Unprecedented market conditions including illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates and economic recession could affect future results.\nEffects of Increases in Pension Costs and Funding Requirements\nThe Company provides defined benefit pension plans for certain employees worldwide. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved amendments to the U.S., Canada and U.K. defined benefit plans that froze the future accumulation of benefits effective June 30, 2013, December 31, 2015 and April 30, 2015, respectively. The funding requirements and costs of these plans are dependent upon various factors, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. Changes in these factors affect the Company\u2019s plan funding, cash flow and results of operations.\nEffects of Inflation and Cost Increases\nThe Company, from time to time, experiences cost increases reflecting, in part, general inflationary factors. There is no guarantee that the Company can increase selling prices or reduce costs to fully mitigate the effect of inflation on company costs.\nAbility to Successfully Integrate Key Acquisitions\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy includes title, imprint and other business acquisitions, including knowledge-enabled services which complement the Company\u2019s existing businesses. Acquisitions may have a substantial impact on the Company\u2019s revenues, costs, cash flows, and financial position. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties in integrating acquired operations and in realizing expected opportunities; diversions of management resources and loss of key employees; challenges with respect to operating new businesses; debt incurred in financing such acquisitions; and other unanticipated problems and liabilities.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAt April 30, 2016, the Company had $951.7 million of goodwill and $877.0 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. The intangible assets are principally comprised of content and publishing rights, customer relationships, and brands and trademarks. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections could result in an asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with determinable lives are tested for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment exists can be difficult as a result of increased uncertainty and current market dynamics, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAttracting and Retaining Key Employees\nThe Company is highly dependent on the continued services of its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior officers and key employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and the Company\u2019s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we are dependent upon our ability to continue to attract new employees with key skills to support business growth.", "PERMNO": 82932, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "JW.A"}
