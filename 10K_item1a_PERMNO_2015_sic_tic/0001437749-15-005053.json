{"cik": "1078099", "company": "MeetMe, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Related to Our Business\nIf we cannot increase our daily and monthly active users and increase their engagement on MeetMe, our future operating results may decline.\nWe offer applications that are free to use, with only a small percentage of our users paying for virtual goods. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users. We must continue to add new members to our user base and retain existing members by offering new and engaging features and products in order to attract advertising investment and generate virtual currency revenue. The challenges we face include, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nattract new users and retain existing users at a consistent rate;\n\u25cf\nincrease engagement by existing users;\n\u25cf\nmonetize our growing base of mobile users;\n\u25cf\nanticipate changes in the social networking and social discovery industry;\n\u25cf\nlaunch new products and release enhancements that become popular;\n\u25cf\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased member usage, fast load times and the deployment of new features and applications;\n\u25cf\nprocess, store and use data in compliance with governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy;\n\u25cf\ncompete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the social networking or social discovery industry;\n\u25cf\nhire, integrate and retain world class talent; and,\n\u25cf\nexpand our business internationally and with respect to mobile devices.\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users\u2019 level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance is significantly affected by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. A decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render us less attractive to advertisers, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if we fail to:\n\u25cf\nintroduce new and improved products that are favorably received;\n\u25cf\nidentify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market;\n\u25cf\nprovide a compelling user experience with the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, and size of advertising and other commercial content we display;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to develop features for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n\u25cf\nacquire or license leading technologies;\n\u25cf\navoid technical or other problems that prevent us from delivering our services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience; or\n\u25cf\nprovide adequate customer service to users or advertisers.\nIf we are unable to maintain and increase our user base and user engagement, our revenue, financial results, and future growth potential may be adversely affected.\nWe believe the number of our registered members is higher than the number of actual users.\nWe believe the number of registered members in our network may be higher than the number of actual users because some members may have multiple registrations, other members may have died or may have become incapacitated, and others may have registered under fictitious names. Members also terminate their memberships and delete their profiles. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of our active members.\nIf our members do not interact with each other or our viral marketing strategy fails, our ability to attract new members may suffer and our revenue may decrease.\nThe majority of our members do not visit MeetMe frequently and spend a limited amount of time when they do visit. The majority of our page views are generated by a minority of our users. If we are unable to encourage our members to interact more frequently and to increase the amount of user generated content they provide, our ability to attract new users and our financial results may suffer. In addition, part of our success depends on our users interacting with our products and contributing to our viral advertising platform (Social Theater). If our Social Theater platform is unsuccessful and our users do not participate in Social Theater campaigns, our operating results may suffer.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue from advertising. If we incur a loss of advertisers, or a reduction in spending by advertisers, our revenue could substantially decline resulting in significant operating losses and negatively impacting our cash flows.\nThe majority of our revenue is currently generated from parties advertising on our platform. As is common in the industry, our advertisers typically do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our advertisers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us, if we do not deliver advertising and other commercial content in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. Our advertising revenue could be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on MeetMe;\n\u25cf\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that reduce the size, frequency, or relative prominence of advertising and other commercial content that we display;\n\u25cf\nour inability to improve our analytics and measurement solutions that demonstrate the value of our advertising and other commercial content;\n\u25cf\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors;\n\u25cf\nadverse legal developments relating to advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation;\n\u25cf\nadverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the way online advertising is priced;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of new technologies that could block or obscure the display of our advertising and other commercial content; and\n\u25cf\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the advertising industry in general.\nThe occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our advertising and other commercial content, which may reduce the prices we receive for our advertising and other commercial content, or cause advertisers to stop advertising with us altogether. In turn, we may incur a substantial decline in revenue, increased operating losses, and a negative impact on cash flows.\nWe have entered into significant agreements with our advertising partner, and its default or other inability to perform under these contracts could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have entered into two agreements with Beanstock Media, Inc., or Beanstock, with respect to our advertising inventory on both web and mobile. We have a Media Publisher Agreement with Beanstock under which Beanstock has the exclusive right and obligation to fill substantially all of our remnant advertising inventory on www.meetme.com through December 31, 2015. We anticipate that revenue under this agreement for the year 2015 will constitute approximately 12% of our total revenue. In addition, we have entered into an Advertising Agreement with Beanstock whereby Beanstock will have the exclusive right and obligation to fill certain advertising inventory on our MeetMe mobile apps for iOS and Android, as well as the meetme.com website when accessed using a mobile device and as optimized for mobile devices, starting on or about March 1, 2015. We anticipate that revenue under this agreement for the year 2015 will constitute approximately 50% of our total revenue.\nA failure by us to renew either of these agreements, or to do so on terms less favorable, or a failure by Beanstock to effectively perform its obligations under either agreement could have detrimental operating, financial and reputational consequences for our business. In particular, if Beanstock files for bankruptcy protection, becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to meet its payment obligations to us, we could be prevented from collecting on receivables under the respective agreement, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we cannot effectively monetize our mobile products, we may not be able to successfully grow our business.\nThe shift of our audience from web to mobile may be disruptive to our business and operating results. As our users shift from web to mobile access, web page views have decreased. Decreasing web traffic contributes to declining web revenue. Our business faces the challenge of ramping up mobile monetization to offset declining web revenues as users continue to increase their mobile access. The transition in our user access may impact revenue in the short-term and medium-term as mobile monetization continues to mature slowly. Accordingly, as users increasingly access MeetMe mobile products as a substitute for using personal computers, if personal computer usage continues to be phased out by the popularity of smart phones and tablets, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users, our revenue and financial results may be negatively affected.\nBecause we face significant competition from other social networks and companies with greater resources, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe face significant competition from other companies that seek to connect members online. Our competitors are other companies providing portal and online community services, such as Facebook, Google, Tagged, Badoo, PlentyOfFish, Skout, and Okcupid. Many of our competitors have greater resources, more established reputations, a broader range of content and products and services, longer operating histories, and more established relationships with their users than we do. They can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of competitive ways, including developing ways to attract and maintain users. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market requirements. Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful efforts at developing new services or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nthe usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our services compared to our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe size and composition of our user base;\n\u25cf\nthe engagement of our users with our services;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and market acceptance of services, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors\u2019 services;\n\u25cf\nour ability to monetize our services, including our ability to successfully monetize mobile usage;\n\u25cf\nthe frequency, size, and relative prominence of the advertising and other commercial content displayed by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncustomer service and support efforts;\n\u25cf\nmarketing and selling efforts;\n\u25cf\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.\nIf we are not able to effectively compete, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, which could make us less attractive to advertisers and materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nBecause we face competition from traditional media companies, we may not be included in the advertising budgets of large advertisers, which could harm our operating results.\nMajor brand and network advertising drives most of our revenue. We rely primarily on cost per thousand (\u201cCPM\u201d) advertising, where the price for advertising is based on the number of users who view it. In addition to Internet companies, we face competition from companies that offer traditional media advertising opportunities. Most large advertisers have set advertising budgets, a portion of which is allocated to Internet and mobile advertising. We expect that large advertisers will continue to increase their advertising efforts on the Internet and mobile devices. If we fail to convince these companies to spend a portion of their advertising budgets on social media and specifically with us, however, our operating results could be harmed.\nAn increasing number of individuals are utilizing devices other than personal computers to access the Internet. If versions of our applications developed for these devices do not gain widespread adoption, or do not function as intended, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including smart phones, cell phones and handheld tablets, has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. We have launched a MeetMe mobile application for Android smart phones, iPhones and iPads. We are dependent on interoperability with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade our platform\u2019s functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect our mobile application usage on mobile devices. Each device manufacturer or platform provider may establish unique or restrictive terms and conditions for developers on such devices or platforms, and our games may not work well or be viewable on these devices as a result. Smart phones, cell phones and handheld tablets generally have lower processing speed, power, functionality and memory than computers. As a result, our mobile application and similar applications we may develop in the future may not be compelling to users. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems that we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we cannot effectively monetize the continuing shift to mobile devices, our business could be negatively affected.\nSince we rely on the Apple \u201cApp Store\u201d and \u201cGoogle Play\u201d to obtain new mobile MeetMe members, if either denies us access or changes its search and rating algorithms we may not be able to acquire new mobile members.\nWe acquire new mobile members for MeetMe primarily through the Apple \u201cApp Store\u201d and Google \u201cPlay\u201d (formerly the Android \u201cMarketplace\u201d). On more than one occasion in the past, Apple has rejected our applications because of user generated content and other concerns. In response we devoted additional resources to image review, and changed some of our content allowance policies. If we fail to maintain access to either or both the App Store and Google Play outlets, our business and operating results will suffer. In addition, our iPhone and Android applications rank near the top of the \u201cFree Social\u201d categories and near the top of many key search terms. However, Apple and Google have changed their rating and search algorithms in the past without notice. Future changes to the rating and search algorithms by Apple or Google may impact our rating and search results, causing a drop in new mobile application downloads and causing our business and operating results to suffer.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop successful applications for mobile platforms and standalone mobile applications, our growth prospects could suffer.\nWe have offered applications for mobile platforms since May 2010. We launched our first standalone application in 2013 and are continuing to develop standalone applications. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of mobile applications and standalone applications, but there can be no assurances that we will continue to succeed in developing applications that appeal to users or advertisers. We may encounter difficulty in attracting leading advertisers to our mobile applications. With respect to our standalone applications, we may encounter difficulty attracting users to those applications. We may also face challenges working with wireless carriers, mobile platform providers and other mobile communications partners. Finally, we may face challenges converting mobile users into users that pay for in-app products. These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will continue to succeed in developing commercially viable applications for mobile platforms and standalone applications. If we do not succeed in doing so, our growth prospects will suffer.\nIf we cannot address technological change in our industry in a timely fashion and develop new services, our future results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Internet and electronic commerce industries are characterized by:\n\u25cf\nrapidly changing technology;\n\u25cf\nevolving industry standards and practices that could render our platform and proprietary technology obsolete;\n\u25cf\nchanges in consumer tastes and demands; and\n\u25cf\nfrequent introductions of new services or products that embody new technologies.\nOur future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, license or acquire leading technologies and program formats, enhance our existing services, and respond to technological advances and consumer tastes and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. Developing website, mobile, and other technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may not be able to successfully use new technologies or adapt our platforms and technology to emerging industry standards. We may not be able to remain competitive or sustain growth if we do not adapt to changing market conditions or customer requirements.\nBecause we plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience, we may be subject to increased business, economic and regulatory risks that could affect our financial results.\nWe plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations. We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. If we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u25cf\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\n\u25cf\nrisks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, and changes in laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement;\n\u25cf\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u25cf\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to our compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities, and/or potential penalties for failing to comply with such local laws;\n\u25cf\nlack of familiarity with local customs;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u25cf\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to implement payment gateways to our users, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe conduct our business in countries outside of the United States and depend on payment gateways that are not as well developed as those in the United States, where most people have credit cards or bank debit cards to use in paying for virtual goods, products, and services. Users in some countries in which we operate do not always have access to credit and debit cards and other payment methods common in the United States. If we are unable to implement payment gateways that provide our members with the ability to pay for goods, products and services easily, our future results may be adversely affected. Additionally, our inability to collect and receive payments from these other sources may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on Facebook as a significant distribution, marketing, and promotion platform, if our relationship with Facebook changes or if Facebook loses market share, our business may be adversely affected.\nFacebook is an important distribution, marketing and promotion platform for our content and applications. We generate a number of our new users through the Facebook platform and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As such, we are subject to Facebook\u2019s standard terms and conditions for Facebook Connect and for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of applications on the Facebook platform.\nOur ability to acquire new members and provide services to our existing members would likely be harmed if:\n\u25cf\nFacebook discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other application developers;\n\u25cf\nFacebook modifies its terms of service or other policies, including changing how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or shared by users;\n\u25cf\nFacebook develops its own competitive offerings; or\n\u25cf\nFacebook disallows our advertising in its platforms.\nWe have benefited from Facebook\u2019s strong brand recognition and large user base. If Facebook loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with users, we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our content and applications, which could consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and any such changes could be unfavorable. Facebook may also change its fee structure or add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook platform.\nBecause our business is subject to complex and evolving United States and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters, we may be subject to claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise sustain harm to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, intellectual property, gaming, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. United States federal, state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. In addition, federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues which could adversely impact our business. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data retention laws and regulations are currently unsettled in the United States and internationally. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices. Complying with these varying state to state or international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe use email, push notifications, and text message campaigns to drive user engagement. Disruptions in, restrictions on, and certain legal risks associated with the sending or receipt of emails, push notifications, or text messages or a decrease in user willingness to receive emails, push notifications, and text messages could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nWe use email, push notifications, and text message campaigns to drive user engagement. We send a large volume of emails, push notifications, and text messages to users notifying them of a variety of activities on our platform, such as new connections. We also rely on the use of email, push notifications, and text messages as a part of our registration and validation processes. Because of the importance of email, push notifications, and text messages to our business, if we are unable to successfully deliver emails, push notifications, or text messages to our users or if users consistently decline to open our emails, push notifications, or text messages, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe also face a risk that service providers or email applications may block bulk message transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails, push notifications, or text messages to our users. Third parties may also block our emails as spam, impose restrictions on our emails, push notifications, or text messages, or start to charge for the delivery of emails through their email systems. In addition, changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may reduce the number of users opening our emails. For example, Google\u2019s Gmail service recently introduced a new feature that organizes incoming emails into categories (for example, primary, social and promotions). Such categorization or similar inbox organizational features may result in our emails being delivered in a less prominent location in a user\u2019s inbox or viewed as \u201cspam\u201d by our users and may reduce the likelihood of that user opening our emails.\nEmail communications may subject us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email or spamming, lost or misdirected messages, security breaches, illegal or fraudulent use of email or personal information or interruptions or delays in email service. For example, in the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for the distribution of \u201ccommercial\u201d email messages and provides for penalties for transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. In addition, some countries and states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are, in some cases, significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act.\nPush notifications and text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or the TCPA, restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic SMS text messages without proper consent. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, has guidelines that impose responsibilities on companies with respect to communications with consumers, such as text messages, and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices it may deem misleading or deceptive. Furthermore, a number of states and countries have enacted statutes that address telemarketing through SMS text messages. Restrictions on marketing through text messages are enforced in the United States by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, state agencies and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA or similar laws. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to our use of push notifications and text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be harmed, and we may be forced to implement new marketing methods, which may be costly or ineffective.\nWithout the ability to deliver emails, push notifications, and text messages to our users we may have limited means of maintaining contact and inducing them to use our platform. Due to the importance of email, push notifications, and text messages to our business, any disruptions or restrictions on the distribution or receipt of emails, push notifications, or text messages or increase in the associated costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nIntegral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties and the employees and key executives in our day-to-day ongoing operations. Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant and widespread disruption to our infrastructure or systems. Our technologies, systems, networks and our users\u2019 devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the Company, our employees or users, or otherwise disrupt our or our users\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and users, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our users use to access our products and services could result in the loss of users and business opportunities, significant business disruption to the Company\u2019s operations and business, misappropriation of the Company\u2019s confidential information and/or that of its users, or damage to the Company\u2019s computers or systems and/or those of its users and/or counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, reputational damage, and additional compliance costs.\nIncreased government regulation could adversely affect our business.\nDue to the rapid growth and widespread use of the Internet, national and local governments are enacting and considering various laws and regulations. In February of 2015, for example, the United States Federal Communication Commission announced its \u201cnet neutrality\u201d intention of regulating broadband Internet providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996. We face uncertainty as to the impact of this decision and other government regulation on our business. New laws and regulations designed to protect consumers could adversely affect our business and operations by exposing us to substantial compliance costs and liabilities and impeding growth in use of the Internet. Furthermore, the application of existing domestic laws and regulations to Internet companies remains somewhat unclear, and courts may apply these laws in unintended and unexpected ways. While online dating and social networking websites are not currently required to verify the age or identity of their members or to run criminal background checks on them, for example any such requirements could increase our cost of operations or discourage use of our services.\nAs we expand internationally, we will also become increasingly subject to foreign laws and regulations which could be inconsistent from country to country. Foreign governments may restrict Internet social networking usage, pass laws that negatively impact our business, or prosecute us for our services. We may incur substantial liabilities for expenses necessary to comply with laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Additionally, restrictions and compliance costs associated with current and possible future laws and regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nIf laws that tax usage and sales on the Internet are enacted, increased taxes could adversely affect the commercial use of our marketing services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that governments might attempt to tax our activities, including the sale of virtual currency. New or revised tax regulations may subject us to additional sales, use, income, and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income, or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and especially sales taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online, reduce Internet sales, and decrease the attractiveness of advertising over the Internet. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business.\nWe have posted our own privacy policy and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policy or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders, or other federal, state or foreign privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumer advocacy groups or others, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Our efforts to protect the information that our users have chosen to share may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee error or malfeasance, or other factors. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. If any of these events occur, our users\u2019 information could be accessed or disclosed improperly.\nFurther, actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements, or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information, or other privacy or data protection-related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of users and advertising partners, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to regulatory investigations and governmental legal proceedings and we expect to be subject to the same in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business.\nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries from regulators and other governmental entities regarding our compliance with laws and other matters. On February 3, 2014 the San Francisco City Attorney filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that the Company engages in unfair business practices with respect to its use of information relating to minors, and particularly with respect to location information and the Company\u2019s disclosure of such use. Responding to or defending this or other such actions may cause us to incur substantial expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention. If we are unsuccessful, we could subject to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations; furthermore, we may have to change our business practices that could impair our ability to obtain new members or service to our members. Any change in our business practices or defense of a legal action or regulatory investigation or action could reduce our future revenues and increase our costs and adversely affect our future operating results.\nViolation of existing or future regulatory or judicial orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future orders issued by, or enforcement actions initiated by, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business.\nIf our members fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide platforms for meeting new people. Although we devote substantial resources to member services and safety, our members have in the past and will likely in the future commit crimes against other members or violate other laws in interacting with such members, which could impair our brand and raise the prospect of litigation that may be costly to defend. Additionally, any inappropriate content or behavior by our members could cause our mobile apps to be removed from the App Store and/or Google Play, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management's attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, complying with public disclosure rules makes our business more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nIf we do not attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our executive officers and other employees. Such employees, particularly product managers and engineers for both web and mobile applications, quality assurance personnel, graphic designers and salespeople, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. We require certain key employees to enter into employment agreements, but in the United States employees are free to leave an employer at any time without penalties. The loss of key employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions of our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause us additional disruptions.\nIf we experience any failure or significant interruption in our network, it could harm our business.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our website and applications and to user satisfaction. Any damage to or failure of our systems or our inability to scale our systems could result in interruptions in our service. We lease space for our data center and rely on a co-location partner for power, security, connectivity and other services. We also rely on third party providers for bandwidth and content delivery. We do not control these vendors and it would take significant time and effort to replace them. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, hurricanes, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. If the site or a particular application is unavailable when users attempt to access it or navigation through an application is slower than they expect, users may stop using the site and become less likely to return as often, if at all. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve all aspects of user experience and site performance. To the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate, or we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate increasing traffic, our business and operating results may suffer.\nBecause our software is highly technical, undetected errors, if any, could adversely affect our business.\nOur products incorporate software that is highly technical and complex. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, flaws, corrupted data or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Any errors, bugs, flaws, corrupted data or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we experience computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, and spamming, it could harm our business.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in the social media industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience hacking attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and attract new users. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose users, and we could suffer financial exposure due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts, investigation costs, changed security, and system protection measures.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to compete with competitors developing similar technologies.\nWe regard the protection of our trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as foreign rights and contractual restrictions. We pursue the registration of domain names and trademarks in the United States and a number of foreign jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or inclusive enough. Our efforts may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter the independent development of similar technologies by others. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our business and operating results and circumstances beyond our control could threaten our intellectual property rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. We regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims, it could cause us to incur significant expenses, pay substantial damages and prevent service delivery.\nCompanies in the Internet, social media technology, and other industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we face, and expect to face in the future, legal actions and other allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement. Any such claims, regardless of merit or outcome, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity or diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we do not prevail against such claims, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be obligated to indemnify our business partners. Furthermore, we could be prevented from providing products and services unless we enter into license or other agreements. We may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us, and as a result, we may be precluded from offering certain products and services.\nClass action lawsuits or other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition to intellectual property claims, we may also become involved in numerous other lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers, or litigation relating to our business transactions or related third party transactions. Any negative outcome from such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nRisk Related to our Stock\nBecause our stock price may be volatile due to factors beyond our control, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur operating results have been in the past, and in the future are likely to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in the number of our daily and monthly active users;\n\u25cf\nchanges in visits by our active members;\n\u25cf\nindependent reports relating to the metrics of our website;\n\u25cf\nour failure to generate increases in revenue;\n\u25cf\nour failure to meet the challenges of monetizing our mobile users;\n\u25cf\nour failure to achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new services, or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ncommercial relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of significant business relationships;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of social media companies;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of major advertisers;\n\u25cf\nfuture acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nthe departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nshort selling activities; or\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.\nBecause we may issue preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nOur Board of Directors, or Board, may issue, without a vote of our shareholders, one or more additional series of preferred stock that have more than one vote per share. This could permit our Board to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Additionally, issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock. This could also cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nBecause most of our outstanding shares are freely tradable, sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nAs of March 9, 2015, we had 44,910,034 shares of common stock outstanding of which our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 6,997,761 which are subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Most of the remaining outstanding shares, including a substantial amount of shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options are and will be freely tradable. Because most of our outstanding shares are freely tradable and a number of shares held by our affiliates may be freely sold (subject to Rule 144 limitation), sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nIf registration rights that we have previously granted are exercised, or if we grant additional registration rights in the future, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe may be obligated to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission shares of common stock, which may then be sold in the open market. We expect that we also will be required to register any securities sold in future private financings. The sale of a significant amount of shares in the open market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or become highly volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Because few securities or industry analysts currently cover our business, undue weight could be placed on any one analyst report. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price could decline.\nBecause we may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new applications or enhance our existing applications, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional funds may be directly related to the strength of the capital and financial markets and the economy both in the United States and internationally. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may need to borrow money or sell additional equity or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nIf we default on our leasing and credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe finance a portion of our expenditures through leasing arrangements, some of which are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet, and we may enter into additional similar arrangements in the future. In particular, we have used these types of arrangements to finance some of our equipment and data centers. If we default on these leasing and credit obligations, our leasing partners and lenders may, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrequire repayment of any outstanding lease obligations;\n\u25cf\nterminate our leasing arrangements;\n\u25cf\nstop delivery of ordered equipment;\n\u25cf\nsell or require us to return our leased equipment; or\n\u25cf\nrequire us to pay significant damages.\nIf some or all of these events were to occur, our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well as our business, financial results, and financial condition, could be adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and our inability to meet our payment obligations may permit our lenders to proceed against the collateral granted pursuant to our loan agreements.\nOur indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\nRequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u25cf\nPlacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.8 million of principal indebtedness outstanding under our loan and security agreement with Venture Lending & Leasing VI, Inc. and Venture Lending & Leasing VII, Inc., dated April 29, 2013, or the Loan Agreement. We may not have sufficient capital or may be unable to arrange for additional capital to pay the amounts due under the Loan Agreement or any other borrowings.\nOur obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a lien on all of our assets. In addition, certain of our deposit accounts are subject to account control agreements with the lenders under the Loan Agreement that gives them the right to assume control of the accounts upon an event of a default under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement contains operating covenants including, among others, covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or other distributions, effect a sale of any part of our business and merge with or acquire another company. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default including upon the occurrence of a payment default, a covenant default, a material adverse change (as defined therein) and insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest on the Loan Agreement will be increased by 5% over the rate that would otherwise be applicable. In addition, the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the Loan Agreement as well as grant the lenders under the Loan Agreement the right to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLSs, of approximately $135 million available to offset future taxable income, that we believe are not currently subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. Our ability to use our NOLs may be limited if we undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change could be triggered by substantial changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock. For example, an ownership change would occur if certain shareholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.\nIn addition, our ability to use any NOLs depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate in future periods. The NOLs may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets, consisting primarily of net operating losses, because evidence does not indicate that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. The NOLs, if not offset against future income, will begin expiring in 2026.", "PERMNO": 86989, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MEET"}
