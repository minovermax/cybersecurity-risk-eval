{"cik": "1084765", "company": "RESOURCES CONNECTION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\n\ufeff\nThe risks described below should be considered carefully before a decision to buy shares of our common stock is made. The order of the risks is not an indication of their relative weight or importance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us but do represent those risks and uncertainties we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely impact and impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and all or part of the investment in our common stock might be lost. When determining whether to buy our common stock, other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes should also be reviewed.\n\ufeff\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ufeff\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the United States and other governmental authorities issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and directives aimed at minimizing the spread of the virus. The impact of the Pandemic and the resulting restrictions have caused disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and may continue to disrupt financial markets and global economic activities.\n\ufeff\nA pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemic poses the risk that we or our employees and partners may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or due to shutdowns that are requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected and in which we operate may, among other things, reduce demand for or delay client decisions to procure our services, or result in cancellations of existing projects. We may also experience a decline in productivity, impacting our ability to continue to serve our clients efficiently. The Pandemic may also have impacted, and may continue to impact, the overall financial condition of some of our clients and their ability to pay outstanding receivables owed to us. While the full impact from the Pandemic is not quantifiable, we experienced some of the foregoing risks during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and, as a result, our results of operations and cash flows were adversely impacted for the year ended May 30, 2020. For example, during the last\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n12 non-holiday weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which started with the week ended March 7, 2020, our average weekly revenue declined 9.1% compared to the first eight non-holiday weeks of the 2020 calendar year. Our number of consultants also decreased from 2,965 as of May 25, 2019 to 2,495 as of May 30, 2020. Due to the disruption of business operations in the U.S. and globally, we have also experienced some decline in our pipeline, and we expect the adverse effects of the Pandemic will continue into fiscal 2021. Furthermore, we have experienced declines in the market price of our stock subsequent to the end of the third quarter. If there are further decreases in our stock price for a sustained period or other unfavorable factors, we may be required to perform a goodwill impairment assessment, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment. Although the impairment is a non-cash expense, it could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we have followed government mandatory stay-at-home orders in certain regions, and suspended all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, which could negatively affect our business. The extent to which the Pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. While not yet quantifiable, management expects this situation will have an adverse impact to our operating results in fiscal 2021.\n\ufeff\nEconomic conditions or changes in the use of outsourced professional services consultants could adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nThe Pandemic has caused disruptions in the U.S. and global economy, and continued uncertainty regarding general economic conditions within some regions and countries in which we operate has led to reluctance on the part of some companies to spend on discretionary projects. This has partially contributed to the decrease in hours worked and the number of professional services consultants at RGP from fiscal 2019 to 2020. Deterioration of or prolonged uncertainty related to the global economy or tightening credit markets could further reduce the demand for our services and adversely affect our business in the future. In addition, the use of professional services consultants on a project-by-project basis could decline for non-economic reasons. In the event of a reduction in the demand for our consultants, our financial results would suffer.\n\ufeff\nEconomic deterioration at one or more of our clients may also affect our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our estimate of losses resulting from our clients\u2019 failure to make required payments for services rendered has historically been within our expectations and the provisions established. While our overall receivable collections have not been severely impacted by the Pandemic, we cannot guarantee we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and cash flows and additional allowances may be required. These additional allowances could materially affect our future financial results.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we are required periodically, but at least annually, to assess the recoverability of certain assets, including deferred tax assets and goodwill. Continued downturns in the United States economy and international economies could adversely affect our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, requiring us to record additional tax valuation allowances. Our assessment of impairment of goodwill is currently based upon comparing our market capitalization to our net book value. Therefore, a significant and protracted downturn in the future market value of our stock could potentially result in an impairment of our goodwill. Although the impairment is a non-cash expense, it could materially affect our future financial results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe market for professional services is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a competitive, fragmented market, and we compete for clients and consultants with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. The competition is likely to increase in the future due to the expected growth of the market and the relatively few barriers to entry. Our principal competitors include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7 consulting firms\n\u00b7 local, regional, national and international accounting and other traditional professional services firms\n\u00b7 independent contractors\n\u00b7 traditional and Internet-based staffing firms\n\u00b7 the in-house or former in-house resources of our clients\n\ufeff\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or future competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, greater revenues and greater name recognition, which may afford them an advantage in attracting and retaining clients and consultants and in offering pricing concessions. Some of our competitors in certain markets do not provide medical and other benefits to their consultants, thereby allowing them to potentially charge lower rates to clients. In addition, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in companies\u2019 needs and developments in the professional services industry.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nOur business depends upon our ability to secure new projects from clients and, therefore, we could be adversely affected if we fail to do so.\n\ufeff\nWe do not have long-term agreements with our clients for the provision of services and our clients may terminate engagements with us at any time. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to secure new projects from clients. For example, if we are unable to secure new client projects because of improvements in our competitors\u2019 service offerings, or because of a change in government regulatory requirements, or because of an economic downturn decreasing the demand for outsourced professional services, our business is likely to be materially adversely affected. New impediments to our ability to secure projects from clients may develop over time, such as the increasing use by large clients of in-house procurement groups that manage their relationship with service providers.\n\ufeff\nWe may be legally liable for damages resulting from the performance of projects by our consultants or for our clients\u2019 mistreatment of our personnel.\n\ufeff\nMany of our engagements with our clients involve projects or services critical to our clients\u2019 businesses. If we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. While we are not currently subject to any client-related legal claims which we believe are material, it remains possible, because of the nature of our business, we may be involved in litigation in the future that could materially affect our future financial results. Claims brought against us could have a serious negative effect on our reputation and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nBecause we are in the business of placing our personnel in the workplaces of other companies, we are subject to possible claims by our personnel alleging discrimination, sexual harassment, negligence and other similar activities by our clients. We may also be subject to similar claims from our clients based on activities by our personnel. The cost of defending such claims, even if groundless, could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain personnel and clients.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to grow our business, manage our growth or sustain our current business.\n\ufeff\nHistorically, we have grown by opening new offices and by increasing the volume of services provided through existing offices. Beginning late in fiscal 2017, we embarked on several new strategic initiatives, including the implementation of a new operating model to drive growth. In addition, in February 2020, we initiated a plan to consolidate our physical geographic presence to certain key markets while shifting to a virtual operating model in certain other markets. Our ability to execute on those strategies or the disruptions related to implementation of the new operating model may impact or limit our ability to grow our business. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain or expand our market presence in our current locations, successfully enter other markets or locations or successfully operate our business virtually without a physical presence in all our markets. Our ability to continue to grow our business will depend upon an improving global economy and a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7 grow our client base\n\u00b7 expand profitably into new geographies\n\u00b7 drive growth in core markets and the digital transformation space\n\u00b7 provide additional professional services offerings\n\u00b7 hire qualified and experienced consultants\n\u00b7 maintain margins in the face of pricing pressures\n\u00b7 manage costs\n\u00b7 maintain or grow revenues and increase other service offerings from existing clients\n\ufeff\nEven if we are able to resume more rapid growth in our revenue, the growth will result in new and increased responsibilities for our management as well as increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls, and our administrative, financial, marketing and other resources. For instance, a limited number of clients are requesting certain engagements be of a fixed fee nature rather than our traditional hourly time and materials approach, thus shifting a portion of the burden of financial risk and monitoring to us. Failure to adequately respond to these new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nOur ability to serve clients internationally is integral to our strategy and our international activities expose us to additional operational challenges we might not otherwise face.\n\ufeff\nOur international activities require us to confront and manage a number of risks and expenses we would not face if we conducted our operations solely in the United States. Any of these risks or expenses could cause a material negative effect on our operating results. These risks and expenses include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences\n\u00b7 less flexible or future changes in labor laws and regulations in the U.S. and in foreign countries\n\u00b7 expenses associated with customizing our professional services for clients in foreign countries\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we sell our professional services in denominations other than United States dollars\n\u00b7 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies\n\u00b7 political and economic instability in some international markets\n\u00b7 multiple, conflicting and changing government laws and regulations\n\u00b7 trade barriers\n\u00b7 compliance with stringent and varying privacy laws in the markets in which we operate\n\u00b7 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences\n\ufeff\nWe have acquired, and may continue to acquire, companies, and these acquisitions could disrupt our business.\n\ufeff\nWe have acquired several companies, including two in each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2018, and we may continue to acquire companies in the future. Entering into an acquisition entails many risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns\n\u00b7 failure to integrate the acquired company with our existing business\n\u00b7 failure to motivate, or loss of, key employees from either our existing business or the acquired business\n\u00b7 failure to identify certain risks or liabilities during the due diligence process\n\u00b7 potential impairment of relationships with our existing employees and clients\n\u00b7 additional operating expenses not offset by additional revenue\n\u00b7 incurrence of significant non-recurring charges\n\u00b7 incurrence of additional debt with restrictive covenants or other limitations\n\u00b7 addition of significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, that are subject to periodic assessment of impairment, primarily through comparison of market value of our stock to our net book value, with such non-cash impairment potentially resulting in a material impact on our future financial results and financial condition\n\u00b7 dilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities\n\u00b7 assumption of liabilities of the acquired company\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\n\ufeff\nWe must provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced consultants, and the loss of a significant number of our consultants, or an inability to attract and retain new consultants, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\ufeff\nOur business involves the delivery of professional services, and our success depends on our ability to provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to satisfy their needs. At various times, such professionals can be in great demand, particularly in certain geographic areas or if they have specific skill sets. Our ability to attract and retain consultants with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7 provide our consultants with either full-time or flexible-time employment\n\u00b7 obtain the type of challenging and high-quality projects our consultants seek\n\u00b7 pay competitive compensation and provide competitive benefits\n\u00b7 provide our consultants with flexibility as to hours worked and assignment of client engagements\n\ufeff\nThere can be no assurance we will be successful in accomplishing any of these factors and, even if we are, we cannot assure we will be successful in attracting and retaining the number of highly qualified and experienced consultants necessary to maintain and grow our business.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to realize the level of benefit that we expect from our restructuring initiatives, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of restructuring initiatives we have undertaken, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we have undertaken in the past, and may undertake in the future, restructuring, reorganization, or other strategic initiatives and business transformation plans to realign our resources with our growth strategies, operate more efficiently and control costs. For example, on February 27, 2020, management and our board of directors committed to a restructuring plan to reduce approximately 7.5% of our management and administrative workforce and consolidate our geographic presence to certain key markets. The restructuring plan was designed to streamline our organizational structure, reduce operating costs and more effectively align resources with business priorities. The successful implementation of our restructuring activities may from time to time require us to effect business and asset dispositions, workforce reductions, management restructurings, decisions to limit investments in or otherwise exit businesses, office consolidations and closures, and other actions, each of which may depend on a number of factors that may not be within our control.\n\ufeff\nAny such effort to realign or streamline our organization may result in the recording of restructuring or other charges, such as asset impairment charges, contract and lease termination costs, exit costs, termination benefits, and other restructuring costs. Further, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can impact a significant amount of management and other employees\u2019 time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. Further, upon completion of any restructuring initiatives, our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to the implementation of the plan and we may be unable to achieve anticipated operating enhancements or cost reductions, which would adversely affect our business, competitive position, operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur computer hardware and software and telecommunications systems are susceptible to damage, breach or interruption.\n\ufeff\nThe management of our business is aided by the uninterrupted operation of our computer and telecommunication systems. These systems are vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, computer viruses, or other interruptions or damage stemming from power outages, equipment failure or unintended usage by employees. In particular, our employees may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. In addition, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, partners and consultants. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches. Security breaches, including cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions by computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber terrorists or others with grievances against the industry in which we operate or us in particular, may disable or damage the proper functioning of our networks and systems. We review and update our systems and have implemented processes and procedures to protect against security breaches and unauthorized access to our data. Despite our implementation of security controls, our systems and networks are vulnerable to computer viruses, malware, worms, hackers and other security issues, including physical and electronic break-ins, router disruption, sabotage or espionage, disruptions from unauthorized\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\naccess and tampering (including through social engineering such as phishing attacks), impersonation of authorized users and coordinated denial-of-service attacks. For example, in the past we have experienced cyber security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our business or results of operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Our systems may be subject to additional risk introduced by software that we license from third parties. This licensed software may introduce vulnerabilities within our own operations as it is integrated with our systems, or as we provide client services through partnership agreements.\n\ufeff\nIt is also possible our security controls over personal and other data may not prevent unauthorized access to, or destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of personally identifiable or other proprietary, confidential, sensitive or valuable information of ours or others; this access could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal, Company or client information that others could use to compete against us or for other disruptive, destructive or harmful purposes and outcomes. Any such disclosure or damage to our networks and systems could subject us to third party claims against us and reputational harm. If these events occur, our ability to attract new clients may be impaired or we may be subjected to damages or penalties. In addition, system-wide or local failures of these information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\ufeff\nFailure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.\n\ufeff\nThe collection, hosting, transfer, disclosure, use, storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy laws. These laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among us and our subsidiaries. In addition, the European Union adopted a comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) that replaced the EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR became fully effective in May 2018. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in additional costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices.\n\ufeff\nLaws and regulations in this area are evolving and generally becoming more stringent. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services has issued cybersecurity regulations that outline a variety of required security measures for protection of data. Other U.S. states, including California and South Carolina, have also recently enacted cybersecurity laws requiring certain security measures of regulated entities that are broadly similar to GDPR requirements, and we expect other states will follow suit. As these laws continue to evolve, we may be required to make changes to our systems, services, solutions and/or products so as to enable us and/or our clients to meet the new legal requirements, including by taking on more onerous obligations in our contracts, limiting our storage, transfer and processing of data and, in some cases, limiting our service and/or solution offerings in certain locations. Changes in these laws, or the interpretation and application thereof, may also increase our potential exposure through significantly higher potential penalties for non-compliance. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations and client demand in this area may limit the use of, or demand for, our services, solutions and/or products, make it more difficult and costly to meet client expectations, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of one or more key members of our senior management.\n\ufeff\nOur future success depends upon the continued employment of our senior management team. The unforeseen departure of one or more key members of our senior management team could significantly disrupt our operations if we are unable to successfully manage the transition. The replacement of members of senior management can involve significant time and expense and create uncertainties that could delay, prevent the achievement of, or make it more difficult for us to pursue and execute on our business opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nFurther, we generally do not have non-compete agreements with our employees and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Our ability to retain the services of members of our senior management and other key employees could be impacted by a number of factors, including competitors\u2019 hiring practices or the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If members of our senior management or other key employees leave our employ for any reason, they could pursue other employment opportunities with our competitors or otherwise compete with us. If we are unable to retain the services of these key personnel or attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, and this could depress our stock price.\n\ufeff\nDelaware corporate law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price future investors are willing to pay for our shares. These provisions:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7 authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance\n\u00b7 divide our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term. Because the classification of the board of directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors, it may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may make it difficult to change the composition of the board of directors\n\u00b7 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors which, if not prohibited, could allow a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to ensure the election of one or more directors\n\u00b7 require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing\n\u00b7 state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, by our chief executive officer, by the board of directors after a resolution is adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, or by the holders of not less than 10% of our outstanding voting stock\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting\n\u00b7 provide that certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws can be amended only by supermajority vote (a 66 2/3 % majority) of the outstanding shares. In addition, our board of directors can amend our bylaws by majority vote of the members of our board of directors\n\u00b7 allow our directors, not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors\n\u00b7 provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors\n\ufeff\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nWe currently have a $120.0 million secured revolving credit facility which is available through October 17, 2021. We are subject to various operating covenants under the credit facility which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and make dispositions of assets. The credit facility also requires us to comply with financial covenants limiting our total funded debt, minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio. Any failure to comply with these covenants may constitute a breach under the credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of any outstanding indebtedness and termination of revolving credit commitments under the credit facility. Our inability to maintain our credit facility could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our business.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to or elect not to pay our quarterly dividend payment.\n\ufeff\nWe currently pay a regular quarterly dividend, subject to quarterly board of director approval. The payment of, or continuation of, the quarterly dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, tax treatment of dividends in the United States, contractual restrictions contained in credit agreements and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid in the future. The failure to pay the quarterly dividend, reduction of the quarterly dividend rate or the discontinuance of the quarterly dividend could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nOur recent rebranding efforts may not be successful. In addition, we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, including our brand name.\n\ufeff\nWe believe establishing, maintaining and enhancing the RGP and Resources Global Professionals brand name is important to our business. We rely on trademark registrations and common law trademark rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand. After the end of fiscal year 2019, we launched a significant global rebranding initiative. However, there can be no assurance that our rebranding initiative will result in a positive return on investment. In addition, there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks will be adequate to prevent use of our trademarks by others. Further, not all of our trademarks were able to successfully register in all of the desired countries. Accordingly, we may not be able to claim or assert trademark or unfair competition claims against third parties for any number of reasons. For example, a judge, jury or other adjudicative body may find that\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe conduct of competitors does not infringe or violate our trademark rights. In addition, third parties may claim that the use of our trademarks and branding infringe, dilute or otherwise violate the common law or registered marks of that party, or that our marketing efforts constitute unfair competition. Such claims could result in injunctive relief prohibiting the use of our marks, branding and marketing activities as well as significant damages, fees and costs. If such a claim was made and we were required to change our name or any of our marks, the value of our brand may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nReclassification of our independent contractors by foreign tax or regulatory authorities could have an adverse effect on our business model and/or could require us to pay significant retroactive wages, taxes and penalties.\n\ufeff\nInternationally, our consultants are a blend of employees and independent contractors. Independent contractor arrangements are more common abroad than in the United States due to the labor laws, tax regulations and customs of the international markets we serve. However, changes to foreign laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification could require classification of consultants as employees. Such reclassification could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, could require us to pay significant retroactive wages, taxes and penalties, and could force us to change our contractor business model in the foreign jurisdictions affected.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 88841, "SIC": 8721, "TIC": "RGP"}
