Risk Factors\nIn addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Economic Slowdown\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2021, the United States\u2019 economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, as the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines allowed for the easing of restrictive measures that had previously been imposed by state and local governments. Despite improvements, certain adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages, disruptions to global supply chains, and rising inflationary pressures, may continue to impact the economic environment for some time. These effects, including any impact to our business, may continue throughout 2022, but remain uncertain and difficult to predict.\nAs a result of the pandemic, we could be subject to any of the following consequences, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u25cf Charge-Offs. If the pandemic leads to a deterioration in economic conditions, we could incur increased charge-offs, loan delinquencies, problem assets or foreclosures.\n\u25cf Adverse Economic Conditions. There could be a reduction in demand for our products, decreases in market values of loans and securities, impairment of intangible assets, decreases in interest and other income, and increases in customer delinquencies and defaults.\n\u25cf Loan and Credit Losses. We may be hampered by governmental regulation or executive orders that restrict or limit our ability to take certain actions that we would otherwise take, such as standard collection and foreclosure procedures.\n\u25cf Indirect Automobile Lending. The essential shut down of the business of selling automobiles and the potential negative impact of the pandemic on consumers\u2019 ongoing financial health may reduce our interest income, increase rates of default and diminish collateral values. An extended disruption to this line of business and/or significantly increased loan defaults may be detrimental to our overall growth plans and profits.\n\u25cf Real Estate Market and Real Estate Lending. Our commercial and residential real estate markets may experience decreasing property values, reducing demand for properties, and increasing vacancies if businesses fail or close locations.\n\u25cf Cybersecurity. As a result of allowing remote access to primary banking systems, the Bank faces significantly increased cybersecurity risks. With more employees working from home, the expanded number of access points creates additional opportunities for cyber criminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Employees may be more susceptible to phishing, social engineering attempts, or other ploys and efforts from those wishing to gain unauthorized access to our data.\n\u25cf Changes in Consumptive Behavior. Consumers and businesses may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after (and perhaps, long after) the crisis has diminished, including a decrease in discretionary spending. Some businesses may take longer to recover, including those that rely on travel or social gathering, and those affected by supply chain issues.\n\u25cf Effects on Key Employees. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\n\u25cf Negative Impact to Investment Management Business Lines. Volatile market conditions caused by the pandemic could reduce the value of assets under management and/or cause clients to withdraw funds. Further, the impact of limited access to our branch staff has reduced the ability to generate referrals that have been a source of new business for our investment arm. Extended or diminished face-to-face interactions with customers could reduce the growth potential of this line of business.\n\u25cf Pension Plan Assets. A prolonged negative impact on the value of stocks and other asset classes will result in a significant reduction to pension plan asset values. This can impact us directly as we maintain a defined benefit pension plan and/or indirectly through the impact on our customers who maintain similar pension assets.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nOur automobile lending exposes us to increased credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, $382.1 million, or 44.8% of our total loan portfolio and 29.8% of our total assets, consisted of indirect automobile loans, which represents loans originated through automobile dealers for the purchase of new or used automobiles. At that date, $6.8 million, or 0.8% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of automobile loans that we originated directly. We serve customers that cover a range of creditworthiness and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles. Automobile loans are inherently risky as they are secured by assets that may be difficult\nto locate and can depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Additional risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through non-bank channels, namely automobile dealers, and reliance on automobile dealers to comply with fair lending practices. We intend to continue to originate indirect automobile loans and to increase this type of lending. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Loan Underwriting Risks.\u201d\nOur emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business lending involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to continue to emphasize the originations of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. At December 31, 2021, our commercial real estate (which includes multi-family real estate loans and commercial construction loans) and commercial business loans totaled $415.9 million, or 48.7% of our loan portfolio. While these types of loans are potentially more profitable than residential mortgage loans due primarily to bearing generally higher interest rates, they are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making future losses more difficult to predict, and possibly more likely. These loans also generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, any charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loans. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Loan Underwriting Risks.\u201d\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of loans in our portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions and other qualitative factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and adjustments may be necessary. A problem with one or more loans could require us to significantly increase our provision for loan losses. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Significant additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisk Related to our Business Strategy\nOur business strategy involves moderate growth, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOur assets increased $152.3 million, or 13.5%, from $1.13 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.28 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in securities. Over the next several years, we expect to experience moderate growth in our total assets and deposits, and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the availability of attractive business opportunities and competition from other financial institutions in our market area. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available or that we will successfully manage our growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to execute our business plan, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBuilding market share through de novo branching may cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nIn 2021, we continued to build market share by opening two newly acquired and two de novo branches in Orange County, New York. There are considerable costs involved in establishing new branches as they require time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their initial start-up costs. Accordingly, any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until the branch attracts a sufficient level of depositors and borrowers to offset expenses. We cannot assure you that our new branches will be successful even after they have been established.\nRisk Related to Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our profits.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board reduced the targeted federal funds rate to near 0% in 2020, but has indicated that it expects to increase rates in 2022. If interest rates rise, and the interest rates on our deposits increase faster than the interest rates we receive on our loans and investments, our interest rate spread would decrease, which would have a negative effect on our net interest income and profitability. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to reinvest such loan or securities prepayments into lower-yielding assets, which may also negatively impact our income.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR transition process and the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect us.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The use of LIBOR in new contracts was discontinued after December 31, 2021, although certain USD LIBOR tenors will continue to be published on a representative basis until June 30, 2023. We have certain trust preferred securities and limited commercial real estate loans that are indexed to LIBOR. We cannot predict\nwhether and to what extent LIBOR will be supported or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR (with the exception of overnight repurchase agreements, which are expected to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate). When LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under trust preferred securities and our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our banking regulators. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of insurance funds and the depositors and borrowers of Rhinebeck Bank rather than for the protection of our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, classify our assets and determine the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, deposit insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers that open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulators, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or \u201cCECL\u201d, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of establishing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of our allowance for loan losses. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses.\nWe are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting; however, we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses and capital as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The regulations establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, which, when added to the minimum capital ratios, result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. See \u201cItem 1. Supervision and Regulation - Federal Bank Regulation - Capital Requirements.\u201d\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result of the increased political and social awareness surrounding the issue, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. While it is impossible to predict how climate change may directly impact our financial condition and operations; the physical effects of climate change may present certain risks to our customers. Unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact our ability to raise and invest capital in potentially impacted communities. Overall, climate change and its effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Privacy, Security and Technology\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things, requires privacy disclosures, and maintenance of a robust security program that are increasingly subject to change which could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. New laws or changes to existing laws may increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives, including increased privacy-related enforcement activity, and higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our regulators also hold us responsible for privacy and data protection obligations performed by our third-party service providers while providing services to us. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations\nor actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSystems failures or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures designed to prevent such damage, our security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that we could incur significant costs associated with a breach of our computer systems. While we have cyber liability insurance, there are limitations on coverage. Furthermore, cyber incidents carry a great risk of injury to our reputation. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can impose restrictions on our business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer losses.\nOur inability to successfully implement technological change may adversely impact our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services which increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nA deterioration in local economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our primary market area.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u25cf demand for our products and services may decrease;\n\u25cf loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u25cf collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u25cf the value of our securities portfolio may decrease; and/or\n\u25cf the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decrease, thereby impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by a pandemic, inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, increased unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact local economic conditions and could further negatively affect our financial performance. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, or other geopolitical events.\nOur cost of operations is high relative to our assets. Our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses may reduce our profits.\nOur non-interest expenses totaled $35.5 million and $30.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although we continue to monitor our expenses and have achieved certain efficiencies, we have experienced increased costs, especially due to market expansion activities and the opening of four new branch offices in Orange County, New York in 2021. Moreover, our efficiency ratio, comparative to peers, remains high as a result of our higher operating expenses, even though we have increased our net interest income. Our efficiency ratio totaled 75.82% and 67.29% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Failure to control or maintain our expenses may reduce future profits.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio may reduce our profits and our capital levels.\nThe market value of our securities portfolio may fluctuate, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand.\nDeclines in market value may result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which may lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, we may take a charge to earnings to reflect such impairment. Changes in interest rates may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are affected by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes.\nStrong competition within our market area may reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes requires us to charge lower interest rates on our loans and pay higher interest rates on our deposits, which may reduce our net interest income. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Our competitors often aggressively price loan and deposit products when they enter into new lines of business or new market areas. If we are unable to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability would be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. For more information about our market area and the competition we face, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Market Area\u201d and \u201c- Competition.\u201d\nOur success depends on retaining certain key personnel.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals who comprise our senior management team. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation and our wealth management business. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our income. In\naddition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which would reduce our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing the periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of specified dates. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience at such times and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the determination of our deferred income taxes, our fair value measurements and our determination of goodwill impairment.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use broad and diversified risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses if we fail to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may not pay any dividends on our common stock.\nRhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s board of directors has the authority to declare dividends on our common stock subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. We currently intend to retain all our future earnings, if any, for use in our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made by our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions under Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy, our business strategy and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. See \u201cItem1. Business - Waivers of Dividends by Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC.\u201d\nOur common stock is not heavily traded, and the stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market, but the volume of shares traded is relatively low. Prices on stock that is not heavily traded, such as our common stock, can be more volatile than heavily traded stock. Factors such as our financial results, the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors, publicity regarding the banking industry, and various other factors affecting the banking industry may have a significant impact on the market price of the shares the common stock. Management also cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future. Accordingly, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.\nPersons who have purchased stock will own a minority of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s common stock and will not be able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders.\nRhinebeck Bancorp, MHC owns a majority of Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc.\u2019s common stock and, through its board of directors, are able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of stockholders. Generally, the same directors and officers who manage Rhinebeck Bank also manage Rhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. and Rhinebeck Bancorp,\nMHC. Our board of directors and officers or Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC may take action that the public stockholders believe to be contrary to their interests. The only matters that stockholders other than Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC are able to exercise voting control currently include any proposal to implement stock-based benefit plans or a \u201csecond-step\u201d conversion. In addition, Rhinebeck Bancorp, MHC may exercise its voting control to prevent a sale or merger transaction in which stockholders could receive a premium for their shares.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Maryland law may discourage a corporate takeover.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Company\u2019s board of directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company, including a classified board, the ability to classify and reclassify unissued shares of stock of any class or series of stock by setting, fixing, eliminating, or altering in any one or more respects the preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions and qualifications of, dividends on, and redemption, conversion, exchange, and other rights of, such securities and a requirement for any stockholder who desires to nominate a director to abide by strict notice requirements.\nMaryland law also contains anti-takeover provisions that apply to the Company. The Maryland Business Combination Act generally prohibits, subject to certain limited exceptions, corporations from being involved in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (defined in the Act) with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of five years following the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act applies to acquisitions of \u201ccontrol shares,\u201d which, subject to certain exceptions, are shares the acquisition of which entitle the holder, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of a corporation in the election of directors within any of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more, but less than one-third of all voting power; one-third or more, but less than a majority of all voting power or a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares have limited voting rights.\nAlthough these provisions do not preclude a takeover, they may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or deferring a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common stock.
