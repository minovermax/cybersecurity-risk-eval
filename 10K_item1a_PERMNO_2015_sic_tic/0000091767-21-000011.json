{"cik": "91767", "company": "SONOCO PRODUCTS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of our securities. These factors could also cause our actual results to materially differ from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements we make in this report, in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in our public announcements. You should consider the risk factors described below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in evaluating us, our business, and any investment in our securities. Although these are the most significant risk factors of which we are currently aware, they are not the only risk factors to which we are subject. Additional risk factors not currently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could also adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nRisks related to the domestic and global economies and to doing business globally\nOur international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe have operations throughout North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia, with approximately 320 facilities in 34 countries. In 2020, approximately 35% of consolidated sales came from operations outside of the United States, and we expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future. Management of global operations is extremely complex, and operations in foreign countries are subject to local statutory and regulatory requirements, differing legal environments and other additional risks that may not exist, or be as significant, in the United States. These additional risks may adversely affect our business operations and financial results, and include, without limitation:\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency exchange controls;\n\u2022hyperinflation and currency devaluation;\n\u2022possible limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022tariffs, non-tariff barriers, duties, taxes or government royalties, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022our interpretation of our rights and responsibilities under local statutory and regulatory rules for sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes, statutory accounting requirements, licenses and permits, etc. may prove to be incorrect or unsupportable resulting in fines, penalties, and/or other liabilities related to non-compliance, damage to our reputation, unanticipated operational restrictions and/or other consequences as a result of the Company's actions, or inaction, taken to perform our responsibilities or protect our rights;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, or the interpretation of such laws, affecting taxable income, tax deductions, or other attributes relating to our non-U.S. earnings or operations;\n\u2022inconsistent product regulation or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022high social benefit costs for labor, including more expansive rights of foreign unions and work councils, and costs associated with restructuring activities;\n\u2022national and regional labor strikes;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world;\n\u2022differences in local business practices;\n\u2022foreign governments\u2019 restrictive trade policies, and customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations;\n\u2022compliance with and changes in applicable foreign laws;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. laws, including those affecting trade and foreign investment and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022loss or non-renewal of treaties between foreign governments and the U.S.;\n\u2022product boycotts, including with respect to products of our multi-national customers;\n\u2022increased costs of maintaining international manufacturing facilities and undertaking international marketing programs;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022the potential for nationalization or expropriation of our enterprises or facilities without appropriate compensation; and\n\u2022political, social, legal and economic instability, civil unrest, war, catastrophic events, acts of terrorism, and widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases.\nAs discussed further elsewhere in this 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, some of these risks have already affected us.\nGlobal economic conditions and/or disruptions in the credit markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has extensive international operations, and is dependent on customers and suppliers that operate in local economies around the world. In addition, the Company accesses global credit markets as part of its capital allocation strategy. Adverse global macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact our ability to access credit, or the price at which funding could be obtained. Likewise, uncertainty about, or a decline in global or regional economic conditions, could have a significant impact on the financial stability of our suppliers and customers, and could negatively impact demand for our products, as has been the case to some extent as a result of impacts of the global pandemic. Potential effects include financial instability, inability to obtain credit to finance operations, and insolvency.\nThe United Kingdom's exit from the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn 2016, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit), and formally exited the E.U. at the end of January 2020. The U.K. continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020, at which time the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was agreed on December 24, 2020, and ratified by the U.K. Parliament on December 30, 2020, took effect. Brexit could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our U.K. businesses, including affecting relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. The effects of Brexit and the new E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Our annual revenue in 2020 for our U.K. businesses alone totaled approximately $127 million. Although Brexit could have broad-reaching effects beyond just in the U.K. itself, we believe our exposure to this uncertainty is limited.\n8 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets.\nCertain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nFurthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. We cannot guarantee that a violation of export control laws or economic sanctions will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and regulations, as well as the overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations, could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the U.S. and many of its trading partners. In March 2018, the U.S. announced new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products. Other international trade actions and initiatives also were announced in 2018 and 2019, notably the imposition by the U.S. of additional tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China\u2019s imposition of additional tariffs on products of U.S. origin. These tariffs have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, an adverse effect on our costs of products sold and margins in our North America segment.\nIn July 2020, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), became effective. In response to this agreement, other countries may change their own trade policies, including the imposition of additional tariffs and quotas, which could also adversely affect our business outside the U.S.\nIn order to mitigate the impact of these trade-related increases on our costs of products sold, we may increase prices in certain markets and, over the longer term, make changes in our supply chain and, potentially, our U.S. manufacturing strategy. Implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products. We may be unable successfully to pass on these costs through price increases; adjust our supply chain without incurring significant costs; or locate alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner. Further, the uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy makes it difficult to make long-term strategic decisions regarding the best way to respond to these pressures and could also increase the volatility of currency exchange rates. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may reduce operating results and shareholders' equity.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates can cause translation, transaction and other losses that can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, as a result of operating globally, a portion of our consolidated net sales, costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In our consolidated financial statements, we translate the local currency financial results of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars based on their respective exchange rates. Depending on the direction, changes in those rates will either increase or decrease operating results and balances as reported in U.S. dollars. Although we monitor our exposures and, from time to time, may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions or foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency fluctuations and exposes us to counterparty risk of nonperformance.\nChanges in domestic and global economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.\nAlthough our business is diversified across various markets and customers, because of the nature of our products and services, general economic downturns in the United States and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. Current global economic challenges, including the difficulties of the United States and other countries in dealing with the effects of the global pandemic, their rising debt levels, and currency fluctuations are likely to continue to put pressure on the economy, and on us. In response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve slowly began raising its benchmark interest rates over the past few years in response to an improving economy and reduced unemployment. However, as concerns grew in 2019 about a potential global slowdown in the face of unresolved trade negotiations between the United States and China, dampening business investment and slowing the manufacturing sector, the Federal Reserve began lowering rates. On March 15, 2020, at the beginning of the global coronavirus outbreak, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates even further to near 0% and kept them at that level throughout 2020 and into January 2021. If the U.S. economy strengthens and international trade negotiations are successfully resolved, the Federal Reserve may begin to raise its benchmark rate again. Such an increase may, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new variable rate debt and refinancing existing indebtedness, and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, such an increase in rates would put additional pressure on consumers and the economy in general. As evidenced in recent years, tightening of credit availability and/or financial difficulties, leading to declines in consumer and business confidence and spending, affect us, our customers, suppliers and distributors. When such conditions exist, customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to market, which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and result in loss of business. Weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product price/mix and lower profit margins. We have experienced most of these conditions to some extent as a result of the global economic impact of the pandemic. All of these factors may have a material adverse effect on us.\n9 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nRisks related to manufacturing operations\nRaw materials, energy and other price increases or shortages may impact our results of operations.\nAs a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials, labor and other inputs. Most of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties. Principal examples are recovered paper, steel, aluminum and resin. Prices and availability of these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, currency and commodity price fluctuations, tariffs, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers by raising selling prices and/or offset the impact by improving productivity. Although many of our long-term contracts and non-contractual pricing arrangements with customers permit limited price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs, such adjustments may not occur quickly enough, or be sufficient to prevent a materially adverse effect on net income and cash flow. Furthermore, we may not be able to improve productivity or realize sufficient savings from our cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of increased costs.\nSome of our manufacturing operations require the use of substantial amounts of electricity and natural gas, which may be subject to significant price increases as the result of changes in overall supply and demand and the impacts of legislation and regulatory action. We forecast and monitor energy usage, and, from time to time, use commodity futures or swaps in an attempt to reduce the impact of energy price increases. However, we cannot guarantee success in these efforts, and we could suffer adverse effects to net income and cash flow should we be unable to either offset or pass higher energy costs through to our customers in a timely manner or at all.\nSupply shortages or disruptions in our supply chains could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment and supplies from our suppliers, and, in turn, adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. Such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture and/or distribute, as well as for delivery of our raw materials. In particular, a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad or trucks, which are highly regulated. If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods that we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner, we might be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we might be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we might be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, adequate returns from our efforts to optimize our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe continually strive to serve our customers and increase returns to our shareholders through innovation and improved operating performance by investing in productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions and the rationalization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. However, our operations include complex manufacturing systems as well as intricate scheduling and numerous geographic and logistical complexities, and our business initiatives are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. We may not meet anticipated implementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs, and we may not fully achieve expected results. These initiatives could also adversely impact customer retention or our operations. Additionally, our business strategies may change from time to time in light of our ability to implement new business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic uncertainties or developments, or other factors. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of these initiatives. These risks include, among others, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such initiatives, strategies and operating plans; increased difficulty and costs in implementing these efforts; and the incurrence of other unexpected costs associated with operating the business. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will realize these benefits. If, for any reason, the benefits we realize are substantially less than our estimates, or the implementation of these growth initiatives and business strategies adversely affects our operations or costs significantly more or takes significantly longer to effectuate than we expect, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nMaterial disruptions in our business operations could negatively affect our financial results.\nAlthough we take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities, we from time to time encounter an unforeseen material operational disruption in one of our major facilities, which could negatively impact production and our financial results. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to a major equipment failure, labor stoppages, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials, disruptions at our suppliers, fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters and disruptions in utility services. These types of disruptions could materially adversely affect our earnings to varying degrees depending upon the facility, the duration of the disruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative sources of materials or energy. Any losses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies or may be subject to certain deductibles.\nRisks related to acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, which could limit our potential for growth.\nWe have made numerous acquisitions in recent years, and expect to actively seek new acquisitions that management believes will provide meaningful opportunities for growth. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions. Other companies in our industries have similar investment and acquisition strategies to ours, and competition for acquisitions may intensify. If we are unable to identify acquisition candidates that meet our criteria, our potential for growth may be restricted.\n10 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAs noted in the risk factors above, we have invested a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments and we expect that we will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. We are continually evaluating acquisitions and strategic investments that are significant to our business both in the United States and internationally. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments involve numerous risks. As has happened from time to time in the past, acquired businesses may not achieve the expected levels of revenue, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, and acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses, and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions also involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, and the challenges of effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nOther risks and challenges associated with acquisitions include, without limitation:\n\u2022demands on management related to increase in size of our businesses and additional responsibilities of management;\n\u2022diversion of management's attention;\n\u2022disruptions to our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022inaccurate estimates of fair value in accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings;\n\u2022difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022difficulties in integration of departments, systems, technologies, books and records, controls (including internal financial and disclosure controls), procedures, and policies;\n\u2022potential loss of major customers and suppliers;\n\u2022challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022potential failure to identify material problems and liabilities during due diligence review of acquisition targets; and\n\u2022potential failure to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nWhile management believes that acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, no assurance can be given that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings. If actual performance in an acquisition falls significantly short of the projected results, or the assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances was inaccurate or changes, it is possible that a noncash impairment charge of any related goodwill would be required, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with acquisitions or divestitures, we may become subject to liabilities and legal claims.\nIn connection with any acquisitions or divestitures, we have in the past, and may in the future, become subject to liabilities or legal claims, including but not limited to third party liability and other tort claims; claims for breach of contract; employment-related claims; environmental, health and safety liabilities, conditions or damage; permitting, regulatory or other legal compliance issues; or tax liabilities. If we become subject to any of these liabilities or claims, and they are not adequately covered by insurance or an enforceable indemnity or similar agreement from a creditworthy counterparty, we may be responsible for significant out-of-pocket expenditures. Such underinsured liabilities, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties restructuring operations or closing or disposing of facilities.\nWe are continuously seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve our customers and to respond to changes in our markets. Accordingly, from time to time, we have, and are likely to again, close higher-cost facilities, sell non-core assets and otherwise restructure operations in an effort to improve cost competitiveness and profitability. As a result, restructuring and divestiture costs have been, and are expected to be, a recurring component of our operating costs, the magnitude of which could vary significantly from year to year depending on the scope of such activities. Divestitures and restructuring may, and have in the past, result in significant financial charges for the write-off or impairment of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, such activities may divert the attention of management, disrupt our ordinary operations, or result in a reduction in the volume of products produced and sold. There is no guarantee that any such activities will achieve our goals, and if we cannot successfully manage the associated risks, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have investments in joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.\nSeveral of our operations are conducted through joint ventures. In joint ventures, we share ownership and, in some instances, management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information, accounting and making decisions. In certain cases, our joint venture partners must agree in order for the applicable joint venture to take certain actions, including acquisitions, the sale of assets, budget approvals, borrowing money and granting liens on joint venture property. Our inability to take unilateral action that we believe is in our best interests may have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the joint venture and the return on our investment. In joint ventures, we believe our relationship with our co-owners is an important factor to the success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. Finally, we may be required on a legal or practical basis or both, to accept liability for obligations of a joint venture beyond our economic interest, including in cases where our co-owner becomes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its commitments.\n11 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nRisks related to competition, customers, and suppliers\nWe face intense competition, and failure to compete effectively may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive markets. We regularly bid for new and continuing business, and being a responsive, high-quality, low-cost producer is a key component of effective competition. The loss of business from our larger customers, customer changes to alternative forms of packaging, or renewal of business with less favorable terms may have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.\nContinuing consolidation of our customer base and suppliers may intensify pricing pressure.\nLike us, many of our larger customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines, and many of our customers have been acquired. Additionally, many of our suppliers of raw materials are consolidating. This consolidation of customers and suppliers has increased the concentration of our business with our largest customers, and in some cases, increased pricing pressures. Similarly, consolidation of our larger suppliers has resulted in increased pricing pressures from our suppliers. Further consolidation of customers and suppliers could intensify pricing pressure and reduce our net sales and operating results.\nThe loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its production requirements, could have a significant adverse impact on our sales and profitability.\nEach of our segments has large customers, and the loss of any of these could have a significant adverse effect on the segment\u2019s sales and, depending on the magnitude of the loss, our results of operations and financial condition. Although a majority of our master customer contracts are long-term, they are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, pricing, or volume requirements, and the contracts themselves often do not require a specific level of purchasing. There is no assurance that existing customer relationships will be renewed at the same level of production, or at all, at the end of the contract term. Furthermore, the loss of any of our major customers, a reduction in their purchasing levels or an adverse change in the terms of supply agreements with these customers could reduce our net sales and net income. Continued consolidation of our customers could exacerbate any such loss. For more information on concentration of sales volume in our reportable segments, see Item1(c), \"Dependence on Customers.\"\nChallenges to, or the loss of, our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. We own a large number of patents on our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and we own, or have licenses to use, all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. Furthermore, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain of our competitive advantages, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we are from time to time subject to claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights. If we were held liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.\nIntellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to protect our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks related to our products\nWe may not be able to develop new products acceptable to the market.\nFor many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development and timely response to constantly changing consumer demands and preferences. Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Consumer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience, and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. Our failure, or the failure of our customers, to develop new or better products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential and affect our competitive position, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nProduct liability claims and other legal proceedings could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe produce products and provide services related to other parties\u2019 products. While we have built extensive operational processes intended to ensure that the design and manufacture of our products meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers will not experience operational process failures that could result in potential product, safety, regulatory or environmental claims and associated litigation. We are also subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in our areas of operation around the globe. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims; however, in the future, we may not be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable premium cost levels. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n12 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators and other governmental authorities, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. Simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards may require significant expenditures of time and other resources. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.\nWe manufacture packaging products for foods as well as products used in construction and industrial manufacturing. Varying weather conditions can impact crop growing seasons and related farming conditions that can then impact the timing or amount of demand for food packaged in our containers. In addition, poor or extreme weather conditions can temporarily impact the level of construction and industrial activity and also impact the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. Such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks related to environmental, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility laws and regulations\nWe are subject to costs and liabilities related to environmental, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility laws and regulations that could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries in which we do business regarding the environment, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility. Compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditures of financial and employee resources.\nFederal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirements, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and particularly those relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, storage and disposal of a variety of substances, and climate change are significant factors in our business and generally increase our costs of operations. We may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various sites that we now own, use or operate, or previously, owned, used or operated. Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that require substantial, and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditures.\nWe have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs relating to the damage of natural resources, lost property values and toxic tort claims. We have made expenditures to comply with environmental regulations and expect to make additional expenditures in the future. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $8.1 million was reserved for environmental liabilities. Such reserves are established when it is considered probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of potential environmental damage, and the extent of our liability for the damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently reserved amount. Accordingly, additional charges could be incurred that would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nMany of our products come into contact with the food and beverages packaged within, and therefore we are subject to risks and liabilities related to health and safety matters in connection with those products. Accordingly, our products must comply with various laws and regulations for food and beverages applicable to our customers. Changes in such laws and regulations could negatively impact customers\u2019 demand for our products as they comply with such changes and/or require us to make changes to our products. Such changes to our products could include modifications to the coatings and compounds we use, possibly resulting in the incurrence of additional costs. Additionally, because many of our products are used to package consumer goods, we are subject to a variety of risks that could influence consumer behavior and negatively impact demand for our products, including changes in consumer preferences driven by various health-related concerns and perceptions.\nDisclosure regulations relating to the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing, availability and cost of materials used in the manufacture of some of our products. We also incur costs associated with supply chain due diligence, and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a result of such due diligence. Because our supply chain is complex, we may also face reputation risk with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable sufficiently to verify the origins of all such minerals used in our products.\nChanges to laws and regulations dealing with environmental, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility issues are made or proposed with some frequency, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance.\nRisks related to financing activities\nWe, or our customers, may not be able to obtain necessary credit or, if so, on reasonable terms.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding. We also operate a $500 million commercial paper program, supported by a $500 million credit facility committed by a syndicate of eight banks until July 2022. We have the contractual right to draw funds directly on the underlying bank credit facility, which could possibly occur if there were a disruption in the commercial paper market. We believe that the lenders have the ability to meet their obligations under the facility. However, if these obligations were not met, we may be forced to seek more costly or cumbersome forms of credit. Should such credit be unavailable for an extended time, it would significantly affect our ability to operate our business and execute our plans. In addition, our customers may experience liquidity problems as a result of a negative change in the economic environment, including the ability to obtain credit, that could limit their ability to purchase our products and services or satisfy their existing obligations.\nOur credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our cost of borrowing.\n13 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow, increase our vulnerability to economic conditions, and limit or restrict our business activities.\nIn addition to interest payments, from time to time a significant portion of our cash flow may need to be used to service our indebtedness, and, therefore, may not be available for use in our business. Our ability to generate cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our indebtedness could have a significant impact on us, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available to fund working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nCertain of our debt agreements impose restrictions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios and the disposition of assets. The most restrictive covenants currently require us to maintain a minimum level of interest coverage, and a minimum level of net worth. These restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to engage in certain business activities that would otherwise be in our best long-term interests.\nSome of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which would result in our interest expense increasing if interest rates rise.\nThe Company may on occasion utilize debt instruments with a variable rate of interest. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and, depending on the magnitude of variable-rate borrowings outstanding, could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business. Variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2020 were approximately $69 million.\nWe may incur additional debt in the future, which could increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe are continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities and, as we have in the past, we may from time to time incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions and to fund any resulting increased operating needs. As new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we face could increase. While we will have to effect any new financing in compliance with the agreements governing our then existing indebtedness, changes in our debt levels and or debt structure may impact our credit rating and costs to borrow, as well as constrain our future financial flexibility in the event of a deterioration in our financial operating performance or financial condition. At December 31, 2020, our short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt totaled $456 million, consisting primarily of $250 million of debentures due November 2021 and a $184 million Euro-denominated loan due May 2021.\nRisks related to information technology and cybersecurity\nWe rely on our information technology, and its failure or disruption could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions, and we rely on diverse technologies to process, store and report information about our business, and to interact with customers, vendors and employees around the world. As with all large environments, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruption or shutdown due to natural disaster, hardware of software failure, obsolescence, cyberattack, support infrastructure failure, user errors or malfeasance resulting in malicious or accidental destruction of information or functionality, or other catastrophic events.\nFrom time to time, we have been, and we will likely continue to be, subject to cybersecurity-related incidents. However, to date we have not experienced any material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events.\nInformation system damages, disruptions, shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments, and other costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of technical and process-based measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to cyber threats. Furthermore, the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by malicious actors to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems and networks change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is possible that we may in the future suffer a criminal attack whereby unauthorized parties gain access to our information technology networks and systems, including sensitive, confidential or proprietary data, and we may not be able to identify and respond to such an incident in a timely manner.\nA security breach of customer, employee, supplier or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary and personal data and information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. This data and information is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. Although we develop and maintain systems to prevent such events from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, misplaced or lost data, and programming and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data and information. Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisors and other third parties with whom we conduct business. Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised.\nWe continue to see increased regulation of data privacy and security and the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws and national laws regulating the collection and use of data, as well as security and data breach obligations - including, for example, the\n14 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the Cyber Security Law in China, the General Data Protection Law in Brazil and the state of California's Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. It is likely that new laws and regulations will continue to be adopted in the United States and internationally, and existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways that would affect our business. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, the uncertainty and changes in the requirements of multiple jurisdictions may increase the cost of compliance, reduce demand for our services, restrict our ability to offer services in certain locations, and jeopardize business transactions across borders.\nAs a result of potential cyber threats and existing and new data protection requirements, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur ongoing operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive, confidential, proprietary and personal data and information, and the sensitive, confidential, proprietary and personal data and information of our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with the new data privacy laws could result in interruptions or damage to our operations, legal or reputational risks, create liabilities for us, subject us to sanctions by national data protection regulators and result in significant penalties, and increase our cost of doing business, all of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to accounting, human resources, financial and business matters and taxation\nChanges in pension plan assets or liabilities may reduce our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe sponsor various defined benefit plans worldwide, and have an aggregate projected benefit obligation for these plans of approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. The difference between defined benefit plan obligations and assets (the funded status of the plans) significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs and the ongoing funding requirements of the plans. Among other factors, changes in discount rates and lower-than-expected investment returns could substantially increase our future plan funding requirements and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. As of December 31, 2020, these plans hold a total of approximately $1.8 billion in assets consisting primarily of common collective trusts, mutual funds, fixed income securities, and cash, funding a portion of the projected benefit obligations of the plans. If the performance of these assets does not meet our assumptions, or discount rates decline, the underfunding of the plans may increase and we may be required to contribute additional funds to these plans, and our pension expense may increase, which could adversely affect operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity. Beginning in 2019, the Company initiated derisking measures in its U.S. defined benefit pension plans which at December 31, 2020 comprised approximately 81% and 78% of the aggregate projected benefit obligation and plan asset value, respectively, of the Company's worldwide defined benefit plans, These measures included making a voluntary $200 million contribution to the U.S. plans in 2019, reallocating plan assets to primarily fixed income investments, and initiating the process of terminating and annuitizing the Sonoco Pension Plan for Inactive Participants (the \"Inactive Plan\"), the larger of the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Following completion of a limited lump sum offering, the Company is expected to settle all remaining liabilities under the Inactive Plan through the purchase of annuities. The Company anticipates making additional contributions to the Inactive Plan of approximately $150 million in mid-2021 in order to be fully funded on a termination basis at the time of the annuity purchase. However, the actual amount of the Company's long-term liability when it is transferred, and the related cash contribution requirement, will depend upon the nature and timing of participant settlements, as well as prevailing market conditions. Non-cash, pretax settlement charges totaling approximately $560 million are expected to be recognized in 2021 as the lump sum payouts and annuity purchases are made.\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain talented executives, managers and employees is critical to our success.\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers, is important to our business. The experience and industry contacts of our management team and other key personnel significantly benefit us, and we need expertise like theirs to carry out our business strategies and plans. We also rely on the specialized knowledge and experience of certain key technical employees. The loss of these key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives, managers and employees, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success, and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key officers and employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and SEC rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results.\nU.S. GAAP and SEC accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant in the past several years. These changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and to other companies, and may even require us to retrospectively revise prior periods from time to time. Additionally, material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate our company, increase our cost of borrowing, and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner.\nOur financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in the preparation of our financial statements that is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. We believe that accounting for long-lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n15 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a write down would negatively impact our operating results and shareholders' equity.\nAt December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was approximately $1.7 billion. We are required to evaluate our goodwill amounts annually, or more frequently when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment. As a result of this testing, we have in the past recognized goodwill impairment charges, and we have identified two reporting units that are currently at risk of a significant future impairment charge if actual results fall short of expectations. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, changes in our business strategy, and external market conditions, among other factors, could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income. If a significant write down were required, the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and shareholders' equity.\nFull realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors.\nWe have deferred tax assets, including U.S. and foreign operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, employee and retiree benefit items, foreign tax credits, and other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes. We have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized prior to expiration of such deferred tax assets. Our ability to use these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our having future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences. We expect to realize these assets over an extended period. However, if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there were a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences became taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which would increase our effective tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.\nOur annual effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay can change materially as a result of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, changes in the mix of our U.S. and foreign earnings, adjustments to our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issues, and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nAs a large multinational corporation, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and many foreign tax laws and regulations, all of which are complex and subject to significant change and varying interpretations. Changes in these laws or regulations, or any change in the position of taxing authorities regarding their application, administration or interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, our products, and our customers\u2019 products, are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in these indirect taxes could affect the affordability of our products and our customers\u2019 products, and, therefore, reduce demand.\nRecently, international tax norms governing each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade have evolved, and are expected to continue to evolve, due in part to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), an international association of 36 countries including the United States, and supported by the G20. Changes in these laws and regulations, or any change in the position of tax authorities regarding their application, administration or interpretation could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to multinational corporations.\nDue to widely varying tax rates in the taxing jurisdictions applicable to our business, a change in income generation to higher taxing jurisdictions or away from lower taxing jurisdictions may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe make estimates of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues based on our assessment of relevant risks and facts and circumstances existing at the time, and we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. These estimates are highly judgmental. Although we believe we adequately provide for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities, which may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate significantly.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are subject to regular examination by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These taxing authorities may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. Furthermore, regardless of whether any such challenge is resolved in our favor, the final resolution of such matter could be expensive and time consuming to defend and/or settle. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and our deferred tax asset and liability balances.\nIf we fail to continue to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and may be required to restate previously published financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. We are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. As we grow our businesses and acquire other businesses, our internal controls will become increasingly complex and we may require significantly more resources. The integration of acquired businesses into our internal control over financial reporting has required, and will continue to require, significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and will increase our compliance costs. Additionally, maintaining effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is made more challenging by the fact that we have over 190 subsidiaries and joint ventures in 34 countries around the world. As described in Item 9A of this Form 10-K, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2020. There is no assurance that, in the future, material weaknesses will not be identified that would cause management to change its current conclusion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny,\n16 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\ncivil or criminal penalties or litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, and we may be required to restate previously published financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nRisks related to COVID-19\nThe direct and indirect results of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our operations, results of our operations and our financial condition.\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19. Governmental authorities nationally and in affected regions took increasingly dramatic actions and mandated various restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, \u201cshelter at home\u201d orders and advisories, and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. We are an essential provider of consumer, industrial and medical packaging. Our associates are deemed \u201cEssential Critical Infrastructure Workers\u201d under the guidance of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and have received similar designations by the vast majority of other governmental agencies in the 34 countries where the Company operates. As a result, nearly all of the Company\u2019s global operations were able to continue to operate despite locally-mandated temporary shutdown orders that were issued in many of our geographic locations. Certain customers whose products have not been deemed \u201ccritically essential\u201d had to temporarily suspend operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while some others had time periods when they were unable to fully staff their operations. As areas around the world have largely reopened their economies, the Company has seen improved demand for many of its products and services. However, recent indications of a resurgence of the virus in certain regions and the emergence of variants of the virus for which existing vaccines could be less effective have raised concerns about the re-imposition of local restrictions on business activity and a negative effect on consumer behavior that alone, or together, could impede the economic recovery. While the social distancing response to COVID-19 has resulted in increased consumer demand for certain food and household products, the pandemic's recessionary impact on the worldwide economy has significantly decreased demand in our more economically sensitive industrial related businesses and exacerbated their negative price/cost relationships and may result in the future impairment of goodwill at certain of the Company's reporting units.\nSonoco is following these developments closely and will respond with appropriate changes to active production capacity and cost-management initiatives. An extended period of disruption to our served markets or global supply chains could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and overall financial condition. In addition, an extended global recession caused by the pandemic would have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 71176, "SIC": 2650, "TIC": "SON"}
