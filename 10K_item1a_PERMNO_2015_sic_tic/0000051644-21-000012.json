Risk Factors\nWe are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. Some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. The following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. See also Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Disclosure.\nRisks Related to the Global Market and the Economy\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the extent of the continuing impact is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant worldwide operational volatility, uncertainty and disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the extent of the continuing impact will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted, including:\n\u2022the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-at-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders and shut-downs;\n\u2022the effectiveness and timing of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on the financial markets and economic activity generally;\n\u2022the effect of the pandemic on our clients and other business partners;\n\u2022our ability to access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms;\n\u2022our ability to comply with the financial covenant in our Credit Agreement if the material economic downturn results in increased indebtedness or substantially lower EBITDA;\n\u2022potential goodwill or other impairment charges;\n\u2022our ability to achieve the benefits of the 2020 restructuring plan and other cost-saving initiatives;\n\u2022increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working conditions;\n\u2022our ability during the pandemic to provide our services, including the health and wellbeing of our employees; and\n\u2022the ability of our clients to pay for our services during and following the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased financial and economic volatility and uncertainty. The continued downturn in the economy has had, and we expect will continue to have, a negative impact on many of our clients. Some clients have responded to the weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, thereby decreasing the market and demand for our services. In addition, many businesses have adjusted, reduced or suspended operating activities, which has negatively impacted the markets we serve. All of the foregoing has impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our business, financial condition, results of operations and forward-looking expectations.\nFurthermore, modified processes, procedures and controls have been required to respond to the changes in our business environment, as the majority of our employees have continued to work from home and many onsite locations remain closed. The significant increase in remote working of our employees may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including the increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks and phishing attacks, and increased risk of improper dissemination of personal, proprietary or confidential information.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below, including as a result of, but not limited to, the factors listed above.\n\u2022Our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and disruption in the financial markets. Following the severe downturn in most markets following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy continues to be challenging. Economic downturns or uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors, and caution on the part of marketers, can have an effect\non the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. In addition, market conditions can be and have been adversely affected by natural and human disruptions, such as natural disasters, public health crises, severe weather events, military conflict or civil unrest. Our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. In the past, including in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. If our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Operations\n\u2022We operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing. Our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. Our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants.\nCompetitive challenges also arise from rapidly-evolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space, creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools, technologies and process improvements. As data-driven marketing solutions become increasingly core to the success of our brands, any failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and standards in this space could harm our competitive position.\nThe client\u2019s perception of the quality of our agencies\u2019 creative work, its confidence in our ability to protect the confidentiality of their and their customers\u2019 data and its relationships with key personnel at the Company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. An agency\u2019s ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration. On the other hand, because an agency\u2019s principal asset is its people and freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, our relationships with clients can be affected by the departure of key personnel and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client\u2019s account from a much larger competitor.\n\u2022Clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice.\nMany companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. Our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. A relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. In the aggregate, our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 20% of net revenue in 2020. A substantial decline in a large client\u2019s advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients\u2019 policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. These policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies.\n\u2022We may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel.\nOur employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. An important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. Our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control. Changes to U.S. or other immigration policies or travel restrictions imposed as a result of public health, political or security concerns that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. In addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of third-party or temporary workers to staff new, growing or temporary assignments. If we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, or fail to manage our workforce effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022If our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results.\nWe have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions, such as those\nresulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. The direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity.\nFurthermore, in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. However, if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf, or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms, there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow.\n\u2022International business risks could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are a global business, with agencies operating in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. Operations outside the United States represent a significant portion of our net revenues, approximately 35% in 2020. These operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility, large-scale local or regional public health crises, and other difficult social, political or economic conditions. We also must comply with applicable U.S., local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act (2010), which can be comprehensive, complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate, certain of which present heightened compliance challenges. Export controls and economic sanctions, such as those maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients. These restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. Failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm.\nGiven our substantial operations in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, we face continued uncertainty surrounding the implementation and consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Under the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the U.K. and the E.U., the U.K. as of January 31, 2020, is no longer a member of the European Union. In December 2020 the U.K. and the E.U. reached agreement on the new rules that govern the relationship between them as of January 1, 2021. As the parties implement and adjust to their new relationship, it is possible that Brexit and changes resulting from Brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities, large exchange rate fluctuations and negative economic impacts. These impacts and any increased restrictions on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services between the United Kingdom and the remaining members of the European Union, could create uncertainty surrounding our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers and employees, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.\nIn addition, in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. These risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries.\n\u2022We are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition.\nOur industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. Advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. Our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products.\nExisting and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the European Union and the United States, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based, digital and targeted marketing. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer, process or receive certain data that we use in our operations. The European Union, for example, has recently tightened its rules on the transferability of data to the United States. Collection, processing, and storage of biometric identifiers has come under increasing regulation and is the subject of class action litigation. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, or changes in interpretations of current ones, such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection, storage and use of personal data. Any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements, or their application in an unanticipated manner, could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability.\nThe imposition of restrictions on certain technologies by private market participants in response to privacy concerns could also have a negative impact on our digital business. If we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.\nLegislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol, tobacco or marijuana products, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients\u2019 goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. Governmental action, including judicial rulings, on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations. Furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial.\n\u2022We rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks.\nWe rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, develop new business opportunities and digital products, and process business transactions. Our business operations depend on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and sensitive information over the internet and through interconnected systems. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education. We are increasingly the target of hackers, denial of service attacks, malicious code, and other threat actors, which can result in the unauthorized access, misuse, loss, or destruction of data (including confidential and sensitive data), unavailability of services, or other adverse events.\nOur business, which increasingly involves the collection, use and transmission of customer data, may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious third-party attempts to access this data. Power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. We utilize in-house and third parties, including third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services, to perform key operational functions, including the storage, transfer or processing of data. System failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such in-house or third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. We maintain, and we require our third-party service providers to maintain, security controls designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and the confidential and sensitive information we maintain and process. Despite our best efforts, however, the threat landscape is constantly evolving. A cybersecurity incident or data breach affecting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information we process, our data systems, or those operated on our behalf by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to manage our risk exposure and could significantly harm our business. We operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks.\nData privacy or cybersecurity breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. Any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients\u2019 or vendors\u2019 proprietary information and damage our reputation. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and cyberattack techniques change frequently, or are not recognized until successful and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. Increased privacy and cybersecurity requirements may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our business.\n\u2022We face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments.\nWe regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients, such as our acquisition of Acxiom in 2018. These transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. Our customary business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. Though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment\u2019s future performance also factor into the initial consideration. When actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected.\nWe may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. We may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. Furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. Talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. Acquisition and integration activity may also divert management\u2019s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. If we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\n\u2022The costs of compliance with sustainability or other environmental, social responsibility or governance (ESG) laws, regulations or policies, including investor and client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business.\nAs a non-location-specific, non-manufacturing service business we have to date been sheltered from or able to mitigate many direct impacts from climate change and related laws and regulations. We are, however, increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change and laws and regulations related to other sustainability concerns, and, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients or investors. Increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us, and ESG issues are increasingly a focus of the investor community. For example, some clients and investors are requesting that we commit to a net-zero carbon emissions goal and timeframe. Our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. If large shareholders were to reduce their ownership stakes in our Company as a result of dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts in this area, there could be negative impact on our stock price, and we could also suffer reputational harm. Further, if clients\u2019 costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. We could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Results\n\u2022Our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient.\nAgency operating cash flows have a significant impact on our liquidity, and we maintain a commercial paper program, a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to increase flexibility in support of our operating needs. If any of these sources were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity and ability to adequately fund our operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, including in the capital markets, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nUnder our commercial paper program, we are authorized to issue short-term debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion, which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by our $1.5 billion committed corporate credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). If credit under the Credit Agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a leverage ratio and other, non-financial, covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. For example, compliance with the financial covenant would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower revenues, including as a result of economic downturns, client losses or a substantial increase in client defaults. If we were unable to comply with any of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under these agreements could increase. If we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the Credit Agreement could be terminated, any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration, and we could lose access to certain uncommitted financing arrangements and commercial paper.\nFor further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\u2022In connection with the Acxiom acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt.\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Acxiom for approximately $2.3 billion, including customary closing adjustments. The indebtedness we incurred to fund the Acxiom acquisition significantly increased our outstanding debt levels and will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million of senior notes set to mature within two years. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our credit facilities or the debt securities we issued in connection with the\nacquisition, we may be required to refinance, restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations, sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities, and there could be a negative impact on our credit ratings. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that any restructuring, sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet our obligations. If we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, that issuance could also result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\n\u2022Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.\nBecause ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. Our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient short-term debt ratings, and any downgrades to those ratings could increase our borrowing costs and reduce the market capacity for, or our ability to issue, commercial paper. Our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\n\u2022Our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances.\nWe evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets, fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. If certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including approximately $4.9 billion of goodwill. Future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client\u2019s business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. Any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. For further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\u2022Our financial results are exposed to exchange rate risk.\nBecause a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso and South African Rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the U.S. Dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022We may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones.\nFrom time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. They should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. Our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them.
