RISK FACTORS.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers. In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, governmental authorities, including in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, have taken measures to limit the spread of the outbreak, including mandatory business closures, travel restrictions, quarantines, declarations of states of emergency, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d or \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and social distancing protocols, in addition to seeking voluntary facility closures and other restrictions. These actions and the potential resurgence or enhancement of these actions could materially adversely affect our ability, and our consumers\u2019, dealers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability, to adequately staff, manage and maintain their respective businesses. Furthermore, our future results of operations, cash-flows and liquidity could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic due to delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, supply chain disruptions, uncertain demand and additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.\nTo balance wholesale production with the then anticipated impacts to retail demand caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we reduced production in February 2020 and, in late March 2020, temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at all of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and comply with governmental mandated shutdowns. As a result of these actions, we temporarily laid off nearly all our hourly workforce. We paid lump sum severance payments to certain of our laid off employees and provided for the temporary continuation of their healthcare benefits, resulting in charges totaling approximately $1.4 million during the fiscal third and fourth quarters (the \u201cCOVID-19 Shutdown Costs\u201d). We resumed operations at reduced production levels at our manufacturing facilities by mid-May 2020 and we are continuing to ramp up production. Our facilities resumed operations with new temperature screening, social distancing, personal protective equipment, and cleaning protocols to protect our employees and mitigate risk of further business interruption.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted our supply chain, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where products are manufactured. It is also possible that we could experience future disruptions to our supply chain that are significant as well as significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending and demand for our products. In addition, we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to the COVID-19\nPandemic, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key suppliers, other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters or public health emergencies. Further, if there are future closures we may face obstacles and delays in re-opening our manufacturing facilities as we may have to hire and train a substantial number of new employees as some of the employees that we have temporarily laid off may seek or have found other employment.\nThe disruptions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, including the temporary manufacturing suspension and supplier and workforce constraints, resulted in a decline in wholesale unit sales volume of nearly 50% during the February 2020 to June 2020 period as compared to the same prior-year period.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 Pandemic has caused a significant economic slowdown, which could cause a global recession, which we expect would negatively impact the sale of our boats. If general economic conditions deteriorate further we cannot predict the duration or strength of an economic recovery, either in the United States or in the specific markets where we sell our products. Further, consumers often finance purchases of our boats from dealers and accordingly, consumer credit market conditions also influence demand for our boats from dealers. If credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products.\nOn March 19, 2020, we drew $35.0 million on our revolving credit agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Additionally, on May 7, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Fourth Amended & Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) to strengthen our financial flexibility. Among other things, the changes effected by the Amendment provide temporary relief under our financial covenants. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these changes. While the performance of the business and our cash management activities provided the flexibility to repay $25.0 million of the Credit Facility as of June 30, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital and any such additional debt financing that may be needed, beyond the $25.0 million of borrowing availability on the Credit Facility, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread, severity and impact of the pandemic, the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, the effects of the pandemic on our consumers and suppliers, and to the extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The inherent uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, due in part to rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, and market reactions thereto, also makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the potential impact and the future performance of our business. Accordingly, the anticipated negative financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but could be material and last for an extended period of time.\nGeneral economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., affect our industry, demand for our products and our business, and results of operations.\nDemand for premium sport boats, outboard boats, and sterndrive boats can be, and in the past has been, significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment, and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the U.S. In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and tend to defer or avoid expenditures for discretionary items, such as our products. Sales of our products are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels. Our business is cyclical in nature and its success is impacted by economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and discretionary income levels. Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic) that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Corporate restructurings, layoffs, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel and energy prices, higher interest rates, and increases in federal and state taxation may also each materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsumers often finance purchases of our products, and as a result, consumer credit market conditions influence demand for our boats. If credit conditions worsen (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic), and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products.\nOur annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nseasonal consumer demand for our products;\n\u2022\ndiscretionary spending habits;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing in, or the availability of supply in, the used powerboat market;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain a premium brand image;\n\u2022\ndisruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities, including those as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022\nvariations in the timing and volume of our sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n\u2022\nsales promotions by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally;\n\u2022\nconsumer preferences and competition for consumers\u2019 leisure time, including those as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\n\u2022\nimpact of unfavorable weather conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade policy or the imposition of additional tariffs;\n\u2022\ncivil insurrection or social unrest (such as the recent protests and social movements across several North American cities);\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost or availability of our labor; and\n\u2022\nincreased fuel prices.\nDue to these and other factors, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future.\nUnfavorable weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, especially during the peak boating season.\nAdverse weather conditions in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect sales in that region, especially during the peak boating season. Sales of our products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, which represent the peak boating months in most of our markets, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, reduced rainfall levels, or drought conditions during these periods may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby generally reducing consumer demand for our products. Our annual results would be materially and adversely affected if our net sales were to fall below expected seasonal levels during these periods. We may also experience more pronounced seasonal fluctuation in net sales in the future as we continue to expand our businesses. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There can be no assurance that weather conditions will not have a material effect on the sales of any of our products.\nOur results after acquisitions may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following our recent acquisitions.\nThe size of our business has increased significantly as a result of our acquisitions. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of additional operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances we will be successful or that we will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from these or any other acquisitions.\nThe acquisitions may underperform relative to our expectations.\nWe may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency as a combined business that MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest have previously achieved or might achieve separately. The business and financial performance of the acquisitions are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the loss of, or changes to, its relationships with its dealers and suppliers, increased product liability and warranty claims, and negative publicity or other events that could diminish the value of the NauticStar or Crest brand, which in turn could also adversely affect the MasterCraft brand. If we are unable to achieve the same growth,\nrevenues and profitability that our acquisitions have achieved in the past, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn relation to such acquisitions, we recognized significantly higher amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. These intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and an impairment of our intangible assets was triggered as of March 29, 2020, due to the economic outlook at that time, the significant declines in our share price, market volatility and the disruption in our operations, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a result of the analysis, we recorded impairment charges totaling $56.4 million related to the NauticStar and Crest segments (the \u201cImpairment Charges\u201d). The Impairment Charges were principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal third quarter, in market conditions, including our share price, and the outlook for retail and wholesale sales and operating performance, as of March 29, 2020, relative to our acquisition plans and annual impairment test performed as of June 30, 2019. See Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Impairment Charges. This impairment charge, along with the impairment charge recognized in fiscal 2019 related to NauticStar, resulted in the elimination of all goodwill associated with the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions. However as of June 30, 2020, there was $47.5 million of intangible assets other than goodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet. We could continue to incur a significant impact to our financial statements in the form of impairment charges related to these remaining intangible assets if assumptions and expectations related to our acquisitions are not realized.\nWe depend on our network of independent dealers and face increasing competition for dealers.\nSubstantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. Our agreements with dealers in our networks typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have longer terms. The loss of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. Competition for dealers among performance sport boat manufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value, and availability of the manufacturers\u2019 products, the manufacturers\u2019 attention to customer service, and the marketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers. We face intense competition from other premium performance sport, outboard, and sterndrive boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers (some of whom also sell products from other premium performance sport, outboard, and sterndrive boat manufacturers), affecting our ability to attract or retain relationships with qualified and successful dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the premium performance sport, outboard boat, sterndrive boat industries should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A substantial deterioration in the number of dealers or quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur success depends, in part, on the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing.\nBecause we sell nearly all of our products through dealers, their financial health is critical to our success. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected if the financial health of the dealers that sell our products suffers. Their financial health may suffer for a variety of reasons, including a downturn in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, higher rents, increased labor costs and taxes, compliance with regulations, and personal financial issues (all of which may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic).\nIn addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network. Access to floor plan financing generally facilitates our dealers\u2019 ability to purchase boats from us, and their financed purchases reduce our working capital requirements. If floor plan financing were not available to our dealers or if the cost of the financing increases, our sales and our working capital levels would be adversely affected. The availability and terms of financing offered by our dealers\u2019 floor plan financing providers will continue to be influenced by:\n\u2022\ntheir ability to access certain capital markets and to fund their operations in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe performance of their overall credit portfolios;\n\u2022\ntheir willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to dealers; and\n\u2022\nthe overall creditworthiness of those dealers.\nWe may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers.\nMany of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies that enable the dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company, the finance company repossesses the boat and the boat is returned to us. Our obligation to repurchase a repossessed boat for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases, by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our manufacturing levels while still addressing the seasonal retail pattern for our products, our business and margins may suffer.\nThe seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand. Our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. If our dealers reduce their inventories in response to weakness in retail demand, we could be required to reduce our production, resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing and, therefore, lower margins. As a result, we must balance the economies of level production with the seasonal retail sales pattern experienced by our dealers. In addition, as we navigate the unprecedented confluence of demand and disruption precipitated by the COVID-19 Pandemic, our production during this ramp up period will depend, in large part, on our suppliers\u2019 capacity and our ability to grow and maintain a high-performing workforce. Failure to adjust manufacturing levels adequately may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur sales and profitability depend, in part, on the successful introduction of new products.\nMarket acceptance of our products depends on our technological innovation and our ability to implement technology in our boats. Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable or innovative new products. In February 2019 we introduced a new brand, Aviara, with sales beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Our failure to introduce new technologies and product offerings that consumers desire, including our new Aviara models, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Also, our ability to achieve higher margins, in part, relies on the introduction of new features or enhancements to our existing boat models. If we fail to introduce new features or those we introduce fail to gain market acceptance, our margins may suffer.\nIn addition, some of our direct competitors and indirect competitors may have significantly more resources to develop and patent new technologies. It is possible that our competitors will develop and patent equivalent or superior technologies and other products that compete with ours. They may assert these patents against us and we may be required to license these patents on unfavorable terms or cease using the technology covered by these patents, either of which would harm our competitive position and may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe also cannot be certain that our products or features have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs and potential damages.\nWe have a fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease.\nThe fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits.\nThe premium performance sport boat, outboard, and sterndrive boat categories and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to\nsucceed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot provide assurance that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand.\nDuring the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, we observed a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic), it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur international markets require significant management attention, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability.\nWe currently sell our products throughout the world. International markets have been, and will continue to be, a focus for sales growth. We believe many opportunities exist in the international markets, and over time we intend for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total revenue. Several factors, including weakened international economic conditions, could adversely affect such growth and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain our current international sales levels in the future. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention. Some of the countries in which we market, and in which our distributors or licensee(s) sell our products, are subject to political, economic, or social instability. Our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreased costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunfamiliarity with local demographics, consumer preferences, and discretionary spending patterns;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in attracting consumers due to a reduced level of consumer familiarity with our brand;\n\u2022\ncompetition with new, unfamiliar competitors;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations, including rules relating to environmental, health, and safety matters and regulations, and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA;\n\u2022\nnew or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of increases in costly and lengthy import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nchanges to the U.S.\u2019s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls;\n\u2022\nthe relative strength of the U.S. dollar compared to local currency, making our products less price-competitive relative to products manufactured outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\ninsurrection or war that may disrupt or limit our relationships with our foreign consumers.\nOur international operations may not produce desired levels of total sales, or one or more of the foregoing factors may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nInternational tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements, as shown by the recent U.S.-initiated renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement, and Brexit in Europe. This uncertainty includes the possibility of imposing additional tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the U.S and the potential for increased trade barriers between the UK and the European Union. The institution of global trade tariffs carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes may cause our manufacturing cost to rise, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and net earnings.\nThe changing relationships of primarily the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen, and certain other foreign currencies have from time to time had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets and the costs we incur to import certain components for our products. We will often attempt to offset these higher prices with increased discounts, which can lead to reduced net sales per unit.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our debt are currently at relatively low levels. If interest rates increase, the debt service obligations on our indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Please see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for discussion of our market risk related to interest rates.\nThe Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after calendar year 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after calendar year 2021. Moreover, it is possible that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified prior to the end of calendar year 2021. All of our $108.6 million of debt outstanding under our credit agreement as of June 30, 2020 bears interest at a floating rate that uses either LIBOR or the prime rate as the reference rate to calculate our interest rate. Our credit agreement provides that, if the administrative agent has determined that adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR or that LIBOR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to lenders for making, funding or maintaining their loans, then all of our outstanding loans under the credit agreement will be converted into loans that accrue interest at the prime rate. Further, the lenders under our credit agreement will no longer be obligated to make loans using LIBOR as the reference rate.\nUncertainty as to the nature of potential changes to LIBOR, fallback provisions, alternative reference rates or other reforms could adversely impact our interest expense on our floating rate debt that currently uses LIBOR as the applicable reference rate. Further, the discontinuance or modification of LIBOR and the use of the prime rate may result in an increase in the cost of future indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. We intend to closely monitor the financial markets and the use of fallback provisions and alternative reference rates in anticipation of the discontinuance or modification of LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021.\nWe compete with a variety of other activities for consumers\u2019 scarce leisure time.\nOur boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers\u2019 leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase and enjoy our products.\nOur success depends on the continued strength of our brands and the value of our brands, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity.\nWe believe that our brands are a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNegative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. Further, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and operating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer.\nOur manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers.\nOur ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial to our results of operations and future sales and profitability.\nWe rely on the existence of an available hourly workforce to manufacture our boats. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. Although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot provide assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Significant increases in manufacturing workforce costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and, in particular, suppliers of the engine packages used in the manufacturing of our boats.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats. While we believe that our relationships with our current suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, we cannot provide assurance that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of materials available from these suppliers will be sufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. Our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide the components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats may also be adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. As production increases, our need for raw materials and supplies will increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other consumers. Operational and financial difficulties that our suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nThe availability and cost of engines used in the manufacture of our boats are especially critical. For fiscal 2020, we purchased all of the inboard engine packages for our MasterCraft brand boats from Ilmor. We also maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our primary supplier of NauticStar engine packages, Yamaha, and our primary supplier of Crest engine packages, Mercury. While we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of the engines provided will be sufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. If we are required to replace these suppliers, it could cause a decrease in products available for sale or an increase in the cost of goods sold, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to the risk of interruption of our engine supply, these suppliers could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to the engines we use. We are required to purchase a minimum volume of engines from Ilmor annually. In addition, MasterCraft could be required to pay a penalty to Ilmor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain threshold. While these minimums are significantly below our current volumes, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet these minimums in the future.\nTermination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe have informal supply arrangements with some of our suppliers, including the sole supplier of our gas and ballast tanks. In the event of a termination of a supply arrangement, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we need to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe depend on key personnel and we may not be able to retain them or attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified employees in the future.\nOur future success will depend in significant part on the continued service of our senior management team and our continuing ability to attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified and skilled managerial, product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other personnel. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management or other key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may attempt to grow our business through additional acquisitions or strategic alliances and new partnerships, which we may not be successful in completing or integrating.\nWe may in the future explore acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will identify acquisition candidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, complete acquisitions or strategic alliances, or successfully integrate acquired operations into our existing operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as expected. Acquisitions also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated challenges, liabilities and contingencies, and diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations. Similarly, our partnership with leading franchises from other industries to market our products or with third-party technology providers to introduce new technology to the market may not achieve anticipated levels of consumer enthusiasm and acceptance, or achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as expected.\nOur intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, protected design, and trade secret laws. We hold patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, or copyrights, to the extent they are protected designs, or to the extent they are maintained in confidence as trade secrets.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Further, the patents we own could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely affected.\nFurther, we have attempted to protect certain of our vessel hull designs by seeking to register those designs with the U.S. Copyright Office. We cannot provide assurance that our applications will be approved. If approved, protection of the vessel design lasts ten years. However, our protected vessel hull designs could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our designs, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our rights.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot provide assurance that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition,\nand could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nProduct liability, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims may materially affect our financial condition and damage our reputation.\nWe are engaged in a business that exposes us to claims for product liability and warranty claims in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, personal injury, or death. We have in the past incurred such liabilities and may in the future be exposed to liability for such claims. Although we maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all such potential claims. We may experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage or claims that are not covered by insurance, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Adverse determination of material product liability and warranty claims made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and harm our reputation. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. These and other claims we may face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide a limited warranty for our products. We may provide additional warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions.\nAlthough we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose consumers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to workers\u2019 compensation claims and other workplace liabilities.\nCertain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace- related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, and breaches in data security.\nWe use many information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure to operate our business. In addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes, and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems\nand information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings, and other costs. A security breach might also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and associates and could result in potential claims from customers, associates, shareholders, or regulatory agencies. Such events could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.\nWhile we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a cyber-attack or other security breach. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion; however, there can be no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect against potential losses that could adversely affect our business.\nAn increase in energy costs may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHigher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facility and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams that are used in our products. Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase the cost of ownership and operation.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions, and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners, and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, export controls, and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.\nThe FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions.\nEconomic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons, and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors, or consumers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.\nViolations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We cannot provide assurance that all of our local, strategic, or joint partners will comply with these laws and regulations, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the U.S., even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide increase the risk of FCPA or OFAC violations in the future.\nIf we are unable to comply with environmental and other regulatory requirements, our business may be exposed to material liability and/or fines.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the environment. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions that could result in the assessment of fines and penalties, obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand.\nWhile we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required thereunder, we cannot provide assurance that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nAs with most boat construction businesses, our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or whether the environmental conditions were created by us, a prior owner or tenant, or a third-party. While we do not believe that we are presently subject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nNegative public perception of our products or restrictions on the access or the use of our products in certain locations could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nDemand for our products depends in part on their acceptance by the public. Public concerns about the environmental impact of our products or their perceived safety could result in diminished public perception of the products we sell. Government, media, or activist pressure to limit emissions could also negatively impact consumers\u2019 perceptions of our products. Any decline in the public acceptance of our products could negatively impact their sales or lead to changes in laws, rules and regulations that prevent access to certain locations or restrict use or manner of use in certain areas or during certain times, which could also negatively impact sales. Any material decline in the public acceptance of our products could impact our ability to retain existing consumers or attract new ones which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNatural disasters, environmental disasters, the effects of climate change, pandemics, or other disruptions, or civil insurrection or social unrest at our manufacturing facilities or in other regions of the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on the continuous operation of our manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee, Armory, Mississippi, and Owosso, Michigan for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, snow, flood, earthquake, pandemics, civil insurrection or social unrest or any other unforeseen circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in climate could adversely affect our operations by limiting or increasing the costs associated with equipment or fuel supplies. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to customers. The occurrence of any disruption at our manufacturing facilities, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability, during and after the period of the disruption. These disruptions may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage. Although we maintain property, casualty, and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, we have dealers and third-party suppliers located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and tornados, floods and environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to\nmitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Such disasters can disrupt our consumers, dealers, or suppliers, which can interrupt our operational processes and our sales and profits.\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nChanges in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, increases in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential consumers\u2019 discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products.\nOur credit facilities contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility; failure to comply with covenants may result in our lenders restricting or terminating our ability to borrow under such credit facilities.\nIn the past, we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. The availability of borrowing amounts under our credit facilities is dependent on compliance with the debt covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Violation of those covenants, whether as a result of operating losses or otherwise, could result in our lenders restricting or terminating our borrowing ability under our credit facilities. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and other needs, and we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our operations or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in ensuring the availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in raising additional capital, or that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs or will be on terms as favorable as those which have been available to us historically. If we are not able to maintain our ability to borrow under our credit facilities, or to raise additional capital when needed, our business and operations will be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nShareholders may be diluted by future issuances of common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise.\nAny common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock.\nOur common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nIt is possible that an active trading market for our common stock will not be sustained, which could make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock at an attractive price or at all.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for them. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and this Form 10-K, as well as the following:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our services;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\ncoverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022\nissuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend policy;\n\u2022\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic, and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, civil insurrection and social unrest, and responses to such events.\nAs a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it or at all. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, investors may suffer a loss on their investment.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWhile we have paid dividends in the past, we presently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. In addition, we will be permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, which may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our Company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws currently contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour board of directors will be classified into three classes until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nonly our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nwe require advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions they desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which may divert us from our business operations.\nAs a result of our initial public offering, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. As a result, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not previously incur.\nIn addition, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our business strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls, including information technology controls, and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will be material to our general and administrative expenses.\nFurthermore, as a public company, we have and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that have not been reflected in our historical financial statements. In addition, rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. These rules and regulations result in our incurring legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as executive officers.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nPrior to the completion of our initial public offering, we had not operated as a public company and were not required to independently comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC. We were required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016, and our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year and annually thereafter. Additionally, once we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are currently in the process of reviewing, documenting, and testing our internal control over financial reporting. We may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm after we cease to be an emerging growth company. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls after we cease to be an emerging growth company, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could decline.\nAdditionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to make out of period adjustments, restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and share price.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. We may be unable or slow to attract research coverage and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more of these analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 15530, "SIC": 3730, "TIC": "MCFT"}
