{"cik": "1509745", "company": "LEAP THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see the \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Industry Data\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Leap\u2019s Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history on which to base your investment decision. Investment in our biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that our lead product candidate, DKN-01, or any other products will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We do not currently have any products approved by regulatory authorities for marketing and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have incurred significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations.\nAs a result, we have not been profitable to date and have incurred losses in every reporting period since our inception in 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a net loss of $27.5 million, and had an accumulated deficit of $223.0 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses to increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for DKN-01, and as we potentially begin to commercialize DKN-01, if it receives regulatory approval. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. If DKN-01 fails in clinical trials or does not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nThe timing of the milestone and royalty payments we may be entitled to receive from BeiGene, Ltd. is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn January 2020, we entered into an option and license agreement, or the BeiGene Agreement, with BeiGene, Ltd., or BeiGene, pursuant to which we granted BeiGene the option to develop and commercialize DKN-01 in Asia (excluding Japan), Australia and New Zealand (the \u201cBeiGene Territory\u201d). We may be entitled to receive additional payments upon the exercise of BeiGene\u2019s option and the achievement of certain milestones and royalties upon BeiGene\u2019s sales of DKN-01. The receipt of these payments is inherently uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will receive any future milestone or royalty payments from BeiGene.\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.\nWe have not generated any product revenues, and we have no commercial products. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to successfully gain regulatory approval and commercialize DKN-01 or other product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval, we do not know when we will generate revenue from product sales, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales from any product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022\ninitiate and successfully complete development activities, including enrollment of study participants and completion of the necessary clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncomplete and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologics license applications, or BLAs, to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u2022\ncomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nmake or have made commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022\ndevelop a commercial organization capable of manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for any products we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we choose to commercialize on our own; and\n\u2022\nobtain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement from third parties, including government and private payors.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including that DKN-01 may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to complete the development and potential commercialization of DKN-01 or acquire other products.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of DKN-01 and launch and commercialize our product candidates, if we receive regulatory approval. We will require additional capital for further development and potential commercialization. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deploy our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:\n\u2022\ninitiation, progress, timing, costs and results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncosts and timing of additional clinical trial and commercial manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nclinical development plans we establish for DKN-01 and any other future product candidates;\n\u2022\nnumber and characteristics of any new product candidates that we in-license and develop;\n\u2022\noutcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u2022\ncosts of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\neffect of competing product candidates and market developments; and\n\u2022\ncosts and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nIf we are unable to fund our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities due to a lack of capital, our ability to become profitable will be compromised.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates.\nUntil we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates in particular countries, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe ongoing outbreak of the Coronavirus could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations, including on our development of our lead product candidate, DKN-01.\nAs a result of the continuing novel Coronavirus outbreak, or COVID-19, we may experience disruptions that could severely affect our business, including our plans to clinically develop DKN-01, our lead product candidate. For example, our employees are all currently working remotely from our office and unable to work and collaborate physically in person. In addition, widespread business interruptions resulting from the novel Coronavirus may adversely affect our ability to initiate, conduct, and complete critical clinical trials and laboratory operations relating to DKN-01. Specifically, temporary closures or prioritization of COVID-19 related work at certain laboratories, offices, or hospitals at which our nonclinical studies and clinical trials for DKN-01 are conducted, or restrictions on the ability of our employees, clinicians, patients enrolled in our trials, or patients who we would like to recruit to enroll in our trials to travel to or enter into certain facilities due to COVID-19 could adversely affect our operations and our ability to conduct nonclinical studies and clinical trials for DKN-01. Further, governmental health protocols and mandates have restricted the ability of many businesses to operate normally. These measures may have a material adverse impact on the third parties with whom we collaborate, including our clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, laboratory service providers, or BeiGene., and on their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to us. This could negatively affect our ability to advance DKN-01 and cause delays and increased expenses in our projected development timelines and cost.\nWe are continuing to monitor and assess the real and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including with respect to our development of DKN-01. However, the ultimate extent to which the novel Coronavirus impacts our business will depend upon future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the current outbreak or subsequent outbreaks, travel restrictions, actions to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, and the effectiveness of other actions taken in the United States and other countries to treat the disease.\nThe failure to maintain the BeiGene Agreement or the failure of BeiGene to perform its obligations under the BeiGene Agreement could negatively impact our business.\nPursuant to the terms of the BeiGene Agreement, we granted to BeiGene the right to an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory. We have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that BeiGene will dedicate to these efforts or BeiGene\u2019s decision whether and when to exercise its option. We are subject to a number of other risks associated with our dependence on the BeiGene Agreement with respect to DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory, including:\n\u2022\nBeiGene may not comply with applicable regulatory guidelines with respect to developing, manufacturing or commercializing DKN-01, which could adversely impact sales or future development of DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nWe and BeiGene could disagree as to future development plans and BeiGene may delay, fail to commence or stop future clinical trials or other development;\n\u2022\nThere may be disputes between us and BeiGene, including disagreements regarding the BeiGene Agreement, that may result in (1) the delay of or failure to achieve developmental, regulatory and commercial objectives that would result in milestone or royalty payments, (2) the delay or termination of any future development or commercialization of sitravatinib in the BeiGene Territory, and/or (3) costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nBusiness combinations or significant changes in BeiGene\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect BeiGene\u2019s ability or willingness to exercise its option or perform its obligations under the BeiGene Agreement; and\n\u2022\nBeiGene may not properly defend our intellectual property rights, or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential litigation.\nThe BeiGene Agreement is also subject to BeiGene\u2019s right to terminate without cause upon advance notice to us. If the agreement is terminated early, we may not be able to find another collaborator for the further development and commercialization of DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory on acceptable terms, or at all, and we may be unable to pursue continued development and commercialization of DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory on our own.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process.\nThe results of preclinical studies, preliminary study results, and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials or the ultimately completed trials. For instance, while we have early clinical trial results for our clinical studies of DKN-01 in esophagogastric cancer and gynecologic cancer, additional clinical trials are still ongoing and will be needed for the registration of DKN-01. Moreover, these results may not be representative of the ultimate study population. The ultimate study results of our ongoing or future trials may be different than the ones we have seen to date. Additionally, the clinical trials conducted to date were relatively small, open-label, uncontrolled studies. Preliminary and final results from such studies may not be representative of study results that are found in larger, controlled, blinded, and longer term studies.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Preclinical studies may also reveal unfavorable product candidate characteristics, including safety concerns. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, the impact of an active comparator arm, differences in the size and type of patient populations, changes in and adherence to clinical trial protocols, changes in medical prescribing practices, and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants.\nOur future clinical trial results may not be successful. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Moreover, should there be a flaw in a clinical trial, it may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Further, because we currently plan to develop our product candidates for use in combination with other oncology products, the design, implementation, and interpretation of the clinical trials necessary for marketing approval may be more complex than if we were developing our product candidates alone.\nWe may also experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or adversely affect our existing or future development programs, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in identifying and adding new investigators or clinical trial sites, we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and our third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, or we may experience a withdrawal of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, or our studies may fail to reach the necessary level of statistical significance, and we may decide to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future competitive therapies in development;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate or we may have insufficient funds for a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of the clinical trial material of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate to conduct clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nthere may be changes to the therapies which we are administering in combination with our product candidates or changes to standards of care, which require that we change our study design, or otherwise halt, discontinue or delay our clinical studies.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, especially for an early-stage company such as ours. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue could be materially impaired.\nBecause we are at the early stages of the clinical and regulatory development of our product candidates, the time required to obtain approval for them from the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of such regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Any such change may require us to amend our clinical trial protocols, conduct additional studies that require regulatory or institutional review board, or IRB, approval, or otherwise cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Moreover, we have only completed early studies and enrolled limited numbers of patients for DKN-01. DKN-01 will require additional preclinical and clinical development, as well as additional manufacturing development before we will be able to submit a marketing application to the FDA. Moreover, should the FDA determine that a companion diagnostic device is required for use of our product candidates or should we decide to pursue the development of a companion diagnostic device for the use of our product candidates, further development work would be required for such a device, including, possibly the approval of an Investigational Device Exemption for the study of such a device from the FDA, compliance with the FDA\u2019s device regulations, and either FDA clearance or approval of the device for commercial use. Such development would potentially take additional time and be subject to the risk of FDA non-approval or clearance of the diagnostic. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability or the ability of any of our future collaborators to generate revenue from the particular product candidate, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, marketing, promotion, sale, and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States and Europe. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing that product candidate. We have no experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on CROs and consultants to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of\nextensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety, purity, and potency for that indication. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites by, the relevant regulatory authorities.\nWe may also experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, we may fail to reach an agreement with regulators or IRBs regarding the scope, design, or implementation of our clinical trials or regulators or IRBs may require that we modify or amend our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, standard operating procedures or clinical trial protocols, or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or we may be required to engage in additional clinical trial site monitoring or manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nwe, relevant regulators, or IRBs may require the suspension or termination of clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects, or other unexpected characteristics of a product candidate, or due to findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar therapeutic or therapeutic candidate;\n\u2022\nchanges in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations;\n\u2022\nthere may be changes in marketing approval or regulatory review policies during the development period rendering our data insufficient to obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials, analyses, reports, data, or preclinical trials, or we may abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthere may be regulatory questions or disagreements regarding interpretations of data and results, or new information may emerge regarding our product candidates, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our study design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials or find that a product candidate\u2019s benefits do not outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our intended indications;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with our manufacturing processes or our manufacturing facilities for clinical and future commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates or any additional product candidate may not be sufficient to cause the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA, or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may take longer than we anticipate to make a decision on our product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval also varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate.\nApproval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays or limitations in the approval of or the decision not to approve an application. It is\npossible that neither of our product candidates nor any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us or any future collaborators to commence product sales.\nFinally, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications or uses than we request, may require significant safety warnings, including black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, surveillance, or other requirements, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product candidate or if the label for a product candidate does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues from that product candidate could be materially impaired.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of clinical data and necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications or use the same mechanism of action as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for, and design of, the clinical trial in question, including factors such as frequency of required assessments, length of the study and ongoing monitoring requirements;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including the potential advantages or disadvantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies;\n\u2022\ncompetition in recruiting and enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of publicity created by clinical trial sites regarding the trial;\n\u2022\npatients\u2019 ability to comply with the specific instructions related to the trial protocol, proper documentation, and use of the biologic product;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain or maintain patient informed consents;\n\u2022\nthe risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion or not return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, or our inability to complete the development of our product candidates, which could materially\nimpair our ability to generate revenues, limit our ability to obtain additional financing and cause the value of our company to decline.\nThe FDA may determine that any of our current or future product candidates have undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs, and other reviewing entities or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. For example, if concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new therapeutic as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical or preclinical testing of a product candidate, the FDA may order us to cease further development, decline to approve that product candidate or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve it. FDA requests for additional data or information can result in substantial delays in the approval of a new biologic.\nIf any of our product candidates is associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The therapeutic-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe therapeutic safety and efficacy of DKN-01 is unproven, and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize DKN-01.\nDKN-01 is a novel monoclonal antibody and its potential benefit as a therapeutic cancer drug is unproven. Our ability to generate revenues from the sale of product, which we do not expect will occur in the short term, if ever, will depend on successful development and commercialization after approval, if achieved, which is subject to many potential risks. DKN-01 may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If DKN-01 is associated with undesirable side effects or has characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early stage testing for treating cancer have later been found to be ineffective in later stage studies or cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. As a result of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development of novel therapeutic agents, we may never successfully develop, enter into or maintain third party licensing or collaboration transactions with respect to, or successfully commercialize DKN-01, in which case we will not achieve profitability and the value of our stock may decline.\nOur future success is dependent primarily on the regulatory approval and commercialization of DKN-01, which is currently undergoing early stage clinical trials.\nWe do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. Currently, our most advanced clinical-stage product candidate is DKN-01. As a result, our business is substantially dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize DKN-01 in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize the product in the U.S. without first obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA; similarly, we cannot commercialize the product outside of the U.S. without first obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of the product for a target indication, we must demonstrate, with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials, that the product is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. Even if DKN-01 were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations, such as use restrictions for specified age groups,\nwarnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any other product candidate that we may discover, in-license, develop or acquire in the future. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our products, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully than, we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive, especially in the oncology space in which we operate. We face competition with respect to DKN-01, and will likely face competition with respect to any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of cancer. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach for DKN-01, and others are based on entirely different approaches. For example, there are several companies developing product candidates that target the same cancer pathways that we are targeting or that are testing product candidates in the same cancer indications that we are testing. For example, Novartis AG, or Novartis, Merck & Co., or Merck, Pfizer, Inc., and Amgen, Inc. have previously been developing anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibodies.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize DKN-01. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and/or cheaper than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render DKN-01 non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of development and commercialization.\nWe may acquire other assets, form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies, that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including preclinical or clinical stage product candidates, or enter into strategic alliances and collaborations to expand our existing programs and operations, such as we did with the BeiGene Agreement. We may not maintain or complete these transactions on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Any integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt our ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, and require management resources that would otherwise be focused on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find or maintain suitable strategic alliance or collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe expect to rely on BeiGene to perform its obligations under the BeiGene Agreement and to develop and commercialize DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory.\nPursuant to the terms of the BeiGene Agreement, we granted to BeiGene the right to an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory. We expect to rely on BeiGene with respect to DKN-01 in the BeiGene Territory, and will have limited influence over their performance. The failure of BeiGene to exercise the option or to successfully carry out its contractual development and commercialization responsibilities could substantially harm our business, because we have no development or commercialization experience or personnel in the BeiGene Territory. We cannot assure you that BeiGene will execute its option or successfully develop or commercialize DKN-01. If BeiGene were to terminate the BeiGene Agreement, then that could delay our DKN-01 development activities and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or do not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with regulatory requirements, our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely on CROs to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance and control only certain aspects of their activities. The failure of these third parties to successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines could substantially harm our business, because we may be delayed in completing or unable to complete the clinical trials required to support future approval of our product candidates, and we may not obtain marketing approval for or commercialize our product candidates in timely manner or at all. Moreover, these agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by such third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities could be delayed, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur reliance on these third parties for development activities reduces our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocols, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and applicable protocols for that trial and for ensuring that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice Standards, or GLPs, as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with Good Clinical Practices, commonly referred to as GCPs, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs or other regulatory requirements, we or our CROs may be subject to enforcement or other legal actions, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects, and results of operations.\nIf the contract manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our product candidates or components in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to biopharmaceutical manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our product candidates and may lose potential revenues.\nWe do not manufacture any of our product candidates, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. We utilize third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture the clinical trial material of DKN-01 and expect to do so for commercial products, if approved. We do not have any long-term commitments from our CMOs for clinical trial material or guaranteed prices for our product candidates. Any delays in obtaining adequate supplies with respect to our product candidates will delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates compete with other products and product candidates for access to contract manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of CMOs that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If our existing CMOs, or any new third party CMOs that we engage in the future to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials, should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates for us to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers. We may not succeed in our efforts to establish sufficient manufacturing relationships or other alternative arrangements to meet our needs for any of our existing or future product candidates. If for any reason we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates, it will be more difficult for us to conduct clinical trials, develop our product candidates and operate our business.\nAny problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product candidate or component may result in a delay in FDA approval of the product candidate or may impair our ability to manufacture commercial quantities or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could result in the delay, prevention, or impairment of clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates and could adversely affect our business.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of therapeutics often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, (including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing), shortages of qualified personnel, and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state, and foreign regulations. Our CMOs may not perform as agreed or may have a failure of a manufacturing campaign. Any changes or deviations in a manufacturing process may result in the failure of the product to meet the necessary specifications. If our CMOs were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials and for commercial use, if approved, could be jeopardized. Reliance on third-party CMOs entails exposure to risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidate ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreduced day-to-day control over the manufacturing process for our product candidates as a result of using third-party CMOs for all aspects of manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nreduced control over the protection of our trade secrets and know-how from misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure;\n\u2022\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that may be costly or damaging to us or result in delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions to the operations of our third-party CMOs caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, which could result in disruptions in the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn addition, all CMOs of our product candidates and therapeutic substances must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA that are applicable to both finished product and their active components used both for clinical and commercial supply, through its facilities inspection program. Our CMOs must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our marketing applications to the agency. Our CMOs will also be subject to continuing FDA and other regulatory authority\ninspections should we receive marketing approval. Further, we, in cooperation with our CMOs, must supply all necessary chemistry, manufacturing, and control documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis. The cGMP requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates and therapeutic substances may be unable to comply with our specifications, these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. If our CMOs cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they may not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. Any such deviations may also require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nWhile we are ultimately responsible for the manufacture of our product candidates and therapeutic substances, other than through our contractual arrangements, we have little control over our CMOs\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which could significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. A failure to comply with these requirements may also result in regulatory enforcement actions against our CMOs or us, including fines and civil and criminal penalties. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our CMOs\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nAny failure or refusal to supply sufficient quantities of our product candidates could delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts. Any change in our CMOs could be costly because the commercial terms of any new arrangements could be less favorable than our existing arrangements and because the expenses relating to the transfer of necessary technology and processes could be significant, as there are significant regulatory requirements which must be met prior to receiving FDA approval for the transfer of a manufacturing process for a therapeutic antibody product to a new manufacturing facility.\nWe also rely on third parties to store and distribute our product candidates for the clinical trials that we conduct. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development of our product candidates, which could produce additional losses.\nRisks Related to Legal and Compliance Matters\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health and other information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to many federal and state healthcare laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any federal or state healthcare law, or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal, or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, debarment from government contracts and/or refusal of orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, corporate integrity agreements, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially adversely affect our business.\nAlthough an effective compliance program can mitigate the risks of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws may prove to be costly. Any\naction against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate to protect our technology and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We have sought and continue to seek to protect our proprietary position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain. The steps we or our licensors have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the U.S. Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications and those of our licensors, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents or those licensed to us and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection for them.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or if any of our or our licensors\u2019 issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Patents in the field of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are frequently limited in scope based on the sequence of amino acids that form particular parts of the antibody. A portion of our intellectual property portfolio is limited by amino acid sequences found in our product candidates. Other competing companies may have therapeutic antibodies to the same target as our product candidates, but have a different amino acid sequence and, as a result, may not be determined to infringe our patents which are limited by amino acid sequence(s). Even for those patents which are defined by the target of a therapeutic antibody and not limited by an amino acid sequence, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully enforce those patents against our competitors with antibodies to these targets.\nOur pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts, administrative agencies or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our or our licensors\u2019 patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and our stockholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials or development activities of our programs, or any future programs we may acquire;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and Nasdaq and emerging growth companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If in the future any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that are not covered by, or exceed the limits of, our available directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, our stock price may be more volatile and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth\ncompany\u201d until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period and (d) the last day of our 2022 fiscal year containing the fifth anniversary of the date on which shares of our common stock became publicly traded in the U.S.\nEven after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from the disclosure requirements described above, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and being subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statement. We will also be exempt from providing selected and supplemental financial information.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management\u2019s time to comply with these regulations. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. Grants under our equity incentive plans may also cause our stockholders to experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. Most of our outstanding shares of common stock, as well as a substantial number of our shares of common stock underlying outstanding warrants, are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales of common stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased them.", "PERMNO": 16542, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LPTX"}
