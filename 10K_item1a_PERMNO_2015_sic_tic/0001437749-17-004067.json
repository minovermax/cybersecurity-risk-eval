{"cik": "1078099", "company": "MeetMe, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we cannot increase our daily and monthly active users and increase their engagement on MeetMe and Skout, our future operating results may decline.\nWe offer applications that are free to use, with only a small percentage of our users paying for virtual goods. Our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users. We must continue to add new members to our user base and retain existing members by offering new and engaging features and products in order to attract advertising investment and generate revenue from the sale of in-app products. The challenges we face include, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nattract new users and retain existing users at a consistent rate;\n\u25cf\nincrease engagement by existing users;\n\u25cf\nmonetize our user base;\n\u25cf\nanticipate changes in the social networking and social discovery industry;\n\u25cf\nlaunch new products and release enhancements that become popular;\n\u25cf\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased member usage, fast load times and the deployment of new features and applications;\n\u25cf\nprocess, store and use data in compliance with governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy;\n\u25cf\ncompete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the social networking or social discovery industry;\n\u25cf\nhire, integrate and retain world class talent; and,\n\u25cf\nexpand our business internationally and with respect to mobile devices.\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.\nThe size of our user base and our users\u2019 level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance is significantly affected by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels. A decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render us less attractive to advertisers, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if we fail to:\n\u25cf\nintroduce new and improved products that are favorably received;\n\u25cf\nidentify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market;\n\u25cf\nprovide a compelling user experience with the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, and size of advertising and other commercial content we display;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to develop features for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n\u25cf\nacquire or license leading technologies;\n\u25cf\navoid technical or other problems that prevent us from delivering our services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience; or\n\u25cf\nprovide adequate customer service to users or advertisers.\nIf we are unable to maintain and increase our user base and user engagement, our revenue, financial results, and future growth potential could be adversely affected.\nWe believe the number of our registered users is higher than the number of actual users.\nWe believe the number of our registered users is higher than the number of actual users because some members may have multiple registrations, other members may have died or may have become incapacitated, and others may have registered under fictitious names. Members also terminate their memberships and delete their profiles. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of our active members.\nIf our users do not interact with each other or our viral marketing strategy fails, our ability to attract new users may suffer and our revenue may decrease.\nThe majority of our users do not visit MeetMe and Skout frequently and spend a limited amount of time when they do visit. The majority of our page views are generated by a minority of our users. If we are unable to encourage our users to interact more frequently and to increase the amount of user generated content they provide, our ability to attract new users and our financial results may suffer. In addition, part of our success depends on our users interacting with our products and contributing to our viral advertising platform (Social Theater). If our Social Theater platform is unsuccessful and our users do not participate in Social Theater campaigns, our operating results could suffer.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue from advertising, and in particular, digital advertising. If we incur a loss of advertisers, or a reduction in spending by advertisers, our revenue could substantially decline, resulting in significant operating losses and negatively impacting our cash flows.\nWe generate most of our revenue from parties advertising on our platform, and, in particular, those advertisers in the digital advertising market. The digital advertising market, while growing, is still relatively new and remains somewhat unproven. Factors such as the lack of standard metrics in the digital advertising market may lead to varying and inconsistent ad rates and potentially demands for rebates.\nAs is common in the industry, our advertisers typically do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our advertisers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us, if we do not deliver advertising and other commercial content in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. Our advertising revenue could be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on MeetMe;\n\u25cf\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that reduce the size, frequency, or relative prominence of advertising and other commercial content that we display;\n\u25cf\nour inability to increase the rate at which our users \u201cclick through\u201d on the ads we display;\n\u25cf\nour inability to improve our analytics and measurement solutions that demonstrate the value of our advertising and other commercial content;\n\u25cf\nloss of advertising market share to our competitors;\n\u25cf\nadverse legal developments relating to advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation;\n\u25cf\nadverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nobjections to the content of our apps and websites;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the way online advertising is priced;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the digital advertising market, including the introduction of standard metrics;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of new technologies that could block or obscure the display of our advertising and other commercial content; and\n\u25cf\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the advertising industry, and, in particular, the digital advertising industry, in general.\nThe occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our advertising and other commercial content, which could reduce the prices we receive for our advertising and other commercial content, or cause advertisers to stop advertising with us altogether. In turn, we could incur a substantial decline in revenue, increased operating losses, and a negative impact on cash flows.\nWe have terminated agreements with our former advertising partner and may not be able to collect amounts due.\nOn June 2, 2015, we terminated two agreements with Beanstock relating to our advertising inventory on web and mobile: the Web Agreement and the Mobile Agreement. We terminated both agreements for non-payment, and in the third quarter of 2015, we wrote-off the accounts receivable balance under the agreements of $5.7 million as uncollectible. We have filed suit against Beanstock and its guarantor, Adaptive Medias, Inc., and we intend to pursue all available remedies to collect amounts due to us, including liquidated damages under the Mobile Agreement. We cannot guarantee if, when or how much outstanding will be paid to us. We also do not know the amount of time and effort that will be required from management to collect these amounts. On January 20, 2016, the Company received notice from the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case against Beanstock had been filed on October 7, 2015. Both of the state court actions have been stayed by the courts as a result of the bankruptcy filing against Beanstock. For a description of the litigation, see Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nWe fill our advertising inventory internally, without the use an external advertising partner as in the past, and if we fail to maintain and expand our base of advertisers, our revenue and our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to grow our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base. To do so, we must ensure that existing and prospective advertisers know that our advertising products offer a material benefit and can generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, including online, mobile and traditional advertising platforms. Advertisers may not continue to do business with us, or they may reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate competitive returns. Our ability to do so depends on factors including:\n\u25cf\nCompetitiveness of Our Products. We must deliver ads in an effective manner and provide accurate analytics and measurement solutions that demonstrate the value of our advertising products compared to those of our competitors. Similarly, if the pricing of our advertising products does not compare favorably to those of our competitors, advertisers may reduce their advertising with us or choose not to advertise with us at all.\n\u25cf\nTraffic Quality. The success of our advertising program depends on delivering positive results to our advertising customers. Low-quality or invalid traffic, such as robots, spiders and the mechanical automation of clicking, may be detrimental to our relationships with advertisers and could adversely affect our advertising pricing and revenue. If we fail to detect and prevent click fraud or other invalid clicks on ads, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investments, which could lead to dissatisfaction with our products, refusals to pay, refund demands or withdrawal of future business.\n\u25cf\nPerception of Our Platform. Our ability to compete effectively for advertiser budgets depends on our reputation and perceptions regarding our platform.\n\u25cf\nMacroeconomic Conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can have a negative impact on the demand for advertising, particularly with respect to online advertising products. Advertisers may have limited advertising budgets and may view online advertising as lower priority than offline advertising.\nAs is typical in our industry, our advertisers generally do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we may experience attrition in our advertisers in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including losses to competitors or declining advertising budgets. The occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results.\nIf we cannot effectively monetize our mobile products, we may not be able to successfully grow our business.\nThe shift of our audience from web to mobile may be disruptive to our business and operating results. As our users shift from web to mobile access, web page views have decreased. Decreasing web traffic contributes to declining web revenue. Our business faces the challenge of ramping up mobile monetization to offset declining web revenues as users continue to increase their mobile access. The transition in our user access could impact revenue in the short-term and medium-term as mobile monetization continues to mature slowly. Accordingly, as users increasingly access our mobile products as a substitute for using personal computers, if personal computer usage continues to be phased out by the popularity of smart phones and tablets, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users, our revenue and financial results could be negatively affected.\nBecause we face significant competition from other social networks and companies with greater resources, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe face significant competition from other companies that seek to connect members online. Our competitors are other companies providing portal and online community services, such as Facebook, Google, Badoo, PlentyOfFish, and OkCupid. Many of our competitors have greater resources, more established reputations, a broader range of content and products and services, longer operating histories, and more established relationships with their users than we do. They can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of competitive ways, including developing ways to attract and maintain users. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market requirements. Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful efforts at developing new services or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical regions or within certain user demographics that we currently serve or may serve in the future. These advantages could enable these competitors to offer products that are more appealing to users and potential users than our products or to respond more quickly and/or cost-effectively than us to new or changing opportunities. In addition, within the industry generally, costs for users to switch between products are low, and users have a propensity to try new approaches to connecting with people. As a result, new products, entrants and business models are likely to continue to emerge. It is possible that a new product could gain rapid scale at the expense of existing brands through harnessing a new technology or distribution channel, creating a new approach to connecting people or some other means.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nthe usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our services compared to our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe size and composition of our user base;\n\u25cf\nthe engagement of our users with our services;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and market acceptance of services, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors\u2019 services;\n\u25cf\nour ability to monetize our services;\n\u25cf\nthe frequency, size, and relative prominence of the advertising and other commercial content displayed by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncustomer service and support efforts;\n\u25cf\nmarketing and selling efforts;\n\u25cf\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.\nIf we are not able to effectively compete, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, which could make us less attractive to advertisers and materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nBecause we face competition from traditional media companies, we may not be included in the advertising budgets of large advertisers, which could harm our operating results.\nMajor brand and network advertising drives most of our revenue. We rely primarily on cost per thousand (\u201cCPM\u201d) advertising, where the price for advertising is based on the number of users who view it. In addition to mobile application developers and Internet companies, we face competition from companies that offer traditional media advertising opportunities. Most large advertisers have set advertising budgets, a portion of which is allocated to Internet and mobile advertising. We expect that large advertisers will continue to increase their advertising efforts on the Internet and mobile devices. If we fail to convince these companies to spend a portion of their advertising budgets on social media and specifically with us, however, our operating results could be harmed.\nAn increasing number of individuals are using devices other than personal computers to access the Internet. If versions of our applications developed for these devices do not gain widespread adoption, or do not function as intended, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including smart phones, cell phones and handheld tablets, has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. We have launched a mobile application for Android smart phones, iPhones and iPads. We are dependent on interoperability with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade our platform\u2019s functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect our mobile application usage. Each device manufacturer or platform provider may establish unique or restrictive terms and conditions for developers on such devices or platforms, and our applications may not work well or be viewable on these devices as a result.\nWe rely on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications. Our business will suffer if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Apple and Google, if their terms and conditions or pricing change to our detriment, if we violate, or either company believes that we have violated, its terms and conditions, or if either of these platforms are unavailable for a prolonged period of time.\nThe Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are our primary distribution, marketing, promotion and payment platforms for our apps. Any deterioration in our relationship with Google or Apple would harm our business and adversely affect the value of our stock.\nWe are subject to these platforms\u2019 standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of applications. These platforms have policies governing, for example, use of user data, personal and sensitive information, and advertising IDs, as well as ones relating to advertising (including deceptive, disruptive and inappropriate ads) and interference with application and device functionality. If we violate, or if a platform provider believes we have violated, these terms and conditions, the particular platform provider may discontinue or limit our access to that platform, which could prevent us from satisfying our contractual obligations to our mobile customers. Our business could also be harmed if a platform provider modifies its current terms of service or other policies, including fees, in a manner adverse to us.\nWe also rely on the continued operation and availability of these third-party platforms. In the past, platforms have been unavailable for short periods of time. On more than one occasion, for example, Apple has rejected our applications because of user generated content and other concerns. In response we devoted additional resources to image review, and changed some of our content allowance policies. If this recurs on a prolonged or frequent basis, or other similar issues arise that impact users\u2019 ability to download or use our mobile event applications, we may owe some of our customers rebates, which would increase our expenses and lower our gross margins. Our revenue, operating results or brands could also suffer harm. Furthermore, any material change or deterioration in our relationship with these platform providers could harm our business.\nFurthermore, if Google or Apple loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with users, we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our apps, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Google and Apple have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us.\nIf the Apple \u201cApp Store\u201d or \u201cGoogle Play\u201d changes its search and rating algorithms, it could affect our ability to acquire new mobile members.\nOur iPhone and Android applications rank near the top of the \u201cFree Social\u201d categories and near the top of many key search terms. However, Apple and Google have changed their rating and search algorithms in the past without notice. Future changes to the rating and search algorithms by Apple or Google could impact our rating and search results, leading to a drop in new mobile application downloads, which could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop successful applications for mobile platforms and standalone mobile applications, our growth prospects could suffer.\nWe have offered applications for mobile platforms since May 2010. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of mobile applications, but there can be no assurances that we will continue to succeed in developing applications that appeal to users or advertisers. We may encounter difficulty in attracting leading advertisers to our mobile applications. We may also face challenges working with wireless carriers, mobile platform providers and other mobile communications partners. Finally, we may face challenges converting mobile users into users that pay for in-app products. These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will continue to succeed in developing commercially viable applications for mobile platforms. If we do not succeed in doing so, our growth prospects could suffer.\nIf we cannot address technological change in our industry in a timely fashion and develop new services, our future results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Internet and electronic commerce industries are characterized by:\n\u25cf\nrapidly changing technology;\n\u25cf\nevolving industry standards and practices that could render our platform and proprietary technology obsolete;\n\u25cf\nchanges in consumer tastes and demands; and\n\u25cf\nfrequent introductions of new services or products that embody new technologies.\nOur future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, license or acquire leading technologies and program formats, enhance our existing services, and respond to technological advances and consumer tastes and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. Developing mobile and website technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may not be able to successfully use new technologies or adapt our platforms and technology to emerging industry standards. We may not be able to remain competitive or sustain growth if we do not adapt to changing market conditions or customer requirements.\nBecause we plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience, we may be subject to increased business, economic and regulatory risks that could affect our financial results.\nWe plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations. We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. If we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully, our business could suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u25cf\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\n\u25cf\nrisks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, and changes in laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement;\n\u25cf\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u25cf\npotential damage to our brands and reputation due to our compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities, and/or potential penalties for failing to comply with such local laws;\n\u25cf\nlack of familiarity with local customs;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u25cf\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions.\nIf we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to implement payment gateways to our users, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe conduct our business in countries outside of the U.S. and depend on payment gateways that are not as well developed as those in the U.S., where most people have credit cards or bank debit cards to use in paying for virtual goods, products, and services. Users in some countries in which we operate do not always have access to credit and debit cards and other payment methods common in the U.S. If we are unable to implement payment gateways that provide our members with the ability to pay for goods, products and services easily, our future results could be adversely affected. Additionally, our inability to collect and receive payments from these other sources could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on Facebook as a distribution, marketing, and promotion platform, if our relationship with Facebook changes or if Facebook loses market share, our business could be adversely affected.\nFacebook is an important distribution, marketing and promotion platform for our content and applications. We generate a number of our new users through the Facebook platform and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As such, we are subject to Facebook\u2019s standard terms and conditions for Facebook Connect and for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of applications on the Facebook platform.\nOur ability to acquire new members and provide services to our existing members could be harmed if:\n\u25cf\nFacebook discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other application developers;\n\u25cf\nFacebook modifies its terms of service or other policies, including changing how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or shared by users;\n\u25cf\nFacebook develops its own competitive offerings; or\n\u25cf\nFacebook disallows our advertising in its platforms.\nWe have benefited from Facebook\u2019s strong brand recognition and large user base. If Facebook loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with users, we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our content and applications, which could consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and any such changes could be unfavorable. Facebook may also change its fee structure or add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook platform.\nBecause our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters, we could be subject to claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise sustain harm to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, intellectual property, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. In addition, federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues which could adversely impact our business. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data retention laws and regulations are currently unsettled in the U.S. and internationally. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices. Complying with these varying state to state or international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive transnational data that is critical to our operations, including data relating to users, customers, or partners outside the U.S., and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change. For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the European Commission's 2000 Safe Harbour Decision as a legitimate basis on which companies could rely for the transfer of data from the European Union to the U.S.\nProposed legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the European legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that will include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the U.S., at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business.\nWe use email, push notifications, and text message campaigns to drive user engagement. Disruptions in, restrictions on, and certain legal risks associated with the sending or receipt of emails, push notifications, or text messages or a decrease in user willingness to receive emails, push notifications, and text messages could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nWe use email, push notifications, and text message campaigns to drive user engagement. We send a large volume of emails, push notifications, and text messages to users notifying them of a variety of activities on our platform, such as new connections. We also rely on the use of email, push notifications, and text messages as a part of our registration and validation processes. Because of the importance of email, push notifications, and text messages to our business, if we are unable to successfully deliver emails, push notifications, or text messages to our users or if users consistently decline to open our emails, push notifications, or text messages, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe also face a risk that service providers or email applications may block bulk message transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails, push notifications, or text messages to our users. Third parties may also block our emails as spam, impose restrictions on our emails, push notifications, or text messages, or start to charge for the delivery of emails through their email systems. In addition, changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may reduce the number of users opening our emails. For example, Google\u2019s Gmail service has a feature that organizes incoming emails into categories (for example, primary, social and promotions). Such categorization or similar inbox organizational features may result in our emails being delivered in a less prominent location in a user\u2019s inbox or viewed as \u201cspam\u201d by our users and could reduce the likelihood of that user opening our emails.\nEmail communications may subject us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email or spamming, lost or misdirected messages, security breaches, illegal or fraudulent use of email or personal information or interruptions or delays in email service. For example, in the U.S., the CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for the distribution of \u201ccommercial\u201d email messages and provides for penalties for transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. In addition, some countries and states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are, in some cases, significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act.\nPush notifications and text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or the TCPA, restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic SMS text messages without proper consent. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, has guidelines that impose responsibilities on companies with respect to communications with consumers, such as text messages, and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices it may deem misleading or deceptive. Furthermore, a number of states and countries have enacted statutes that address telemarketing through SMS text messages. Restrictions on marketing through text messages are enforced in the U.S. by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, state agencies and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA or similar laws. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to our use of push notifications and text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations, are named in a lawsuit involving these laws or regulations, or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be harmed, and we could be forced to implement new marketing methods, which could be costly or ineffective.\nWithout the ability to deliver emails, push notifications, and text messages to our users we may have limited means of maintaining contact and inducing them to use our platform. Due to the importance of email, push notifications, and text messages to our business, any disruptions or restrictions on the distribution or receipt of emails, push notifications, or text messages or increase in the associated costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and technologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our ads on our website and our mobile applications. These technologies could have had an adverse effect on our financial results and, if such technologies continue to proliferate, in particular with respect to mobile platforms, our future financial results may be harmed.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur ability to attract, retain and serve our users and conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant and widespread disruption to our infrastructure or systems. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyber-attacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks or other malicious activities (or any combination of these events) are on the rise worldwide and constantly evolving. From time to time, we may become the victim of these types of attacks. Our technologies, systems, networks and our users\u2019 devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the Company, our employees or sensitive information provided by our users, or otherwise disrupt our or our users\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and users, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our users use to access our products and services could result in the loss of users and business opportunities, significant business disruption to the Company\u2019s operations and business, misappropriation of the Company\u2019s confidential information and/or that of its users, or damage to the Company\u2019s computers or systems and/or those of its users and/or counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, reputational damage, and additional compliance costs. Furthermore, we may become a victim of security breaches, such as the misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of user, customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations). While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated. Furthermore, we may become a victim of security breaches, such as the misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of user, customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations).\nIf we experience computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, and spamming, it could harm our business.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking, and phishing attacks are prevalent in the social media industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, or the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience hacking attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users could harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and attract new users. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose users, and we could suffer financial exposure due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts, investigation costs, litigation, changed security, and system protection measures.\nIncreased government regulation could adversely affect our business.\nDue to the rapid growth and widespread use of mobile applications and the Internet, national and local governments are enacting and considering various laws and regulations. In February of 2015, for example, the United States Federal Communication Commission announced its \u201cnet neutrality\u201d intention of regulating broadband Internet providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996. We face uncertainty as to the impact of this decision and other government regulation on our business. New laws and regulations designed to protect consumers could adversely affect our business and operations by exposing us to substantial compliance costs and liabilities and impeding growth in use of mobile applications or the Internet. Furthermore, the application of existing domestic laws and regulations remains somewhat unclear, and courts may apply these laws in unintended and unexpected ways. While online dating and social networking websites are not currently required to verify the age or identity of their members or to run criminal background checks on them, for example, any such requirements could increase our cost of operations or discourage use of our services.\nAs a provider of social networking products with a membership-based element, we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain U.S. states and other countries that apply to our automatically-renewing membership payment models. Certain U.S. states and certain countries in Asia also have laws that specifically govern dating services.\nAs we expand internationally, we could also become increasingly subject to foreign laws and regulations which could be inconsistent from country to country. Foreign governments could restrict mobile applications or Internet social networking usage, pass laws that negatively impact our business, or prosecute us for our services. We could incur substantial liabilities for expenses necessary to comply with laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Additionally, restrictions and compliance costs associated with current and possible future laws and regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nIf laws that tax usage and sales on the Internet are enacted, increased taxes could adversely affect the commercial use of our marketing services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of mobile applications and the Internet, it is possible that governments might attempt to tax our activities, including the sale of virtual currency. New or revised tax regulations may subject us to additional sales, use, income, and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income, or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and especially sales taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online, reduce sales, and decrease the attractiveness of advertising on mobile applications or the Internet. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business.\nWe have posted our own privacy policy concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policy or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders, or other federal, state or foreign privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumer advocacy groups, individuals, or others, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, there are numerous privacy laws in the countries in which we operate regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations. Our efforts to protect the information that our users have chosen to share may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee error or malfeasance, or other factors. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. If any of these events occur, our users\u2019 information could be accessed or disclosed improperly.\nWhile we believe that we comply with industry standards and applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct or that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims. Further, actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements, or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information, or other privacy or data protection-related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of users and advertising partners, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to regulatory investigations and governmental legal proceedings and we expect to be subject to the same in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business.\nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries from regulators and other governmental entities regarding our compliance with laws and other matters. On February 3, 2014, the San Francisco City Attorney filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that the Company engaged in unfair business practices with respect to its use of information relating to minors, and particularly with respect to location information and the Company\u2019s disclosure of such use. On August 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release (the \u201cSettlement and Release\u201d\") with the People of the State of California (the \u201cPeople\u201d) resolving all claims relating to this case. Pursuant to the Settlement and Release, the Company agreed, inter alia, to (i) implement a number of privacy-related product changes, (ii) restate its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and (iii) pay $200,000 to the People. On August 19, 2015, the Court dismissed the litigation with prejudice.\nResponding to or defending other such actions could cause us to incur substantial expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention. If we are unsuccessful, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations; furthermore, we could have to change our business practices which could impair our ability to obtain new users or provide service to our users. Any change in our business practices or defense of a legal action or regulatory investigation or action could reduce our future revenues and increase our costs and adversely affect our future operating results.\nViolation of existing or future regulatory or judicial orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future orders issued by, or enforcement actions initiated by, regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our users fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide platforms for meeting new people. Although we devote substantial resources to member services and safety, our users have in the past and will likely in the future commit crimes against other users or violate other laws in interacting with such users, which could impair our brands and raise the prospect of litigation that may be costly to defend. Additionally, any inappropriate content or behavior by our users could cause our mobile apps to be removed from the App Store and/or Google Play, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe face certain risks related to the physical and emotional safety of our users.\nThe nature of online services that connect new people is such that we cannot control the actions of our users in their communication or physical actions. There is a possibility that one or more of our users could be physically or emotionally harmed following interaction with another one of our users. Given our lack of physical presence, we do not take any action to ensure personal safety on a meeting between users arranged following contact initiated with our website or app. If an unfortunate incident of this nature occurred in a meeting of two people following contact initiated on our website or app or on the platform of one of our competitors, any resulting negative publicity could materially and adversely affect us or our industry in general. Any such incident involving our website or app could damage our reputation and our brands. This, in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and could cause the value of our common stock to decline. In addition, the affected users could initiate legal action against us, which could cause us to incur significant expense, whether we were successful or not, and damage our reputation. Concerns for such harms and the use of dating products and social networking platforms for illegal conduct could produce future legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our products, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon our products.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management's attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, complying with public disclosure rules makes our business more visible, which could result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nIf we do not attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our executive officers and other employees. Such employees, particularly product managers and engineers for both web and mobile applications, quality assurance personnel, graphic designers and salespeople, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. We require certain key employees to enter into employment agreements, but in the U.S. employees are free to leave an employer at any time without penalties. The loss of key employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions of our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause us additional disruptions.\nIf we experience any failure or significant interruption in our network, it could harm our business.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our mobile applications and website and to user satisfaction. Any damage to or failure of our systems or our inability to scale our systems could result in interruptions in our service. We lease space for our data center and rely on a co-location partner for power, security, connectivity and other services. We also rely on third party providers for bandwidth and content delivery. We do not control these vendors and it would take significant time and effort to replace some of them. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, hurricanes, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, hacker attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. If our mobile applications or website are unavailable when users attempt to access them or navigation through an application is slower than they expect, users may stop using them and become less likely to return as often, if at all. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve all aspects of user experience. To the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate, or we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate current and increasing traffic, our business and operating results could suffer.\nBecause our software is highly technical, undetected errors, if any, could adversely affect our business.\nOur products incorporate software that is highly technical and complex. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, flaws, corrupted data or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Any errors, bugs, flaws, corrupted data or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to compete with competitors developing similar products.\nWe regard the protection of our trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as foreign rights and contractual restrictions. We pursue the registration of domain names and trademarks in the U.S. and a number of foreign jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or inclusive enough. Our efforts may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter the independent development of similar products by others. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results and circumstances beyond our control could threaten our intellectual property rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. We regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license innovations that could turn out to be material to our business and we could also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets could be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims, it could cause us to incur significant expenses, pay substantial damages and prevent service delivery.\nCompanies in the mobile application, Internet, social media technology, and other industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we face, and expect to face in the future, legal actions and other allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we could face more claims of infringement. Any such claims, regardless of merit or outcome, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity or diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we do not prevail against such claims, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be obligated to indemnify our business partners. Furthermore, we could be prevented from providing products and services unless we enter into license or other agreements. We may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us, and as a result, we could be precluded from offering certain products and services.\nClass action lawsuits or other litigation matters are expensive and time consuming, and could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition to intellectual property claims, we may also become involved in numerous other lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers, or litigation relating to our business transactions or related third party transactions. Defending such lawsuits or any negative outcomes from them could result in payments of substantial fees, monetary damages or fines, or changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nBecause our stock price may be volatile due to factors beyond our control, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur operating results have been in the past, and in the future are likely to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in the number of our daily and monthly active users;\n\u25cf\nchanges in visits by our active users;\n\u25cf\nindependent reports relating to the metrics of our mobile applications or website;\n\u25cf\nour failure to generate increases in revenue;\n\u25cf\nour failure to meet the challenges of monetizing our users;\n\u25cf\nour failure to achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new services, or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ncommercial relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of significant business relationships;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of social media companies;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of major advertisers;\n\u25cf\nfuture acquisitions or combinations;\n\u25cf\nthe departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nshort selling activities; or\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause we may issue preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nOur Board of Directors, or Board, may issue, without a vote of our shareholders, one or more additional series of preferred stock that have more than one vote per share. This could permit our Board to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Additionally, issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock. This could also cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nBecause most of our outstanding shares are freely tradable, sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nAs of March 3, 2017, we had 59,620,606 shares of common stock outstanding of which our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 5.3% which are subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Most of the remaining outstanding shares, including a substantial amount of shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options, are and will be freely tradable. Because most of our outstanding shares are freely tradable and a number of shares held by our affiliates may be freely sold (subject to Rule 144 limitation), sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nIf registration rights that we have previously granted are exercised, or if we grant additional registration rights in the future, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe may be obligated to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission shares of common stock, which may then be sold in the open market. The sale of a significant amount of shares in the open market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or become highly volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Because few securities or industry analysts currently cover our business, undue weight could be placed on any one analyst report. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price could decline.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, which might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new applications or enhance our existing applications, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional funds may be directly related to the strength of the capital and financial markets and the economy both in the U.S. and internationally. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may need to borrow money or sell additional equity or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business could be harmed.\nIf we default on our leasing and credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe finance a portion of our expenditures through leasing arrangements, some of which are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet, and we may enter into additional similar arrangements in the future. In particular, we have used these types of arrangements to finance some of our equipment and data centers. If we default on these leasing and credit obligations, our leasing partners and lenders may, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrequire repayment of any outstanding lease obligations;\n\u25cf\nterminate our leasing arrangements;\n\u25cf\nstop delivery of ordered equipment;\n\u25cf\nsell or require us to return our leased equipment; or\n\u25cf\nrequire us to pay significant damages.\nIf some or all of these events were to occur, our operations could be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well as our business, financial results, and financial condition, could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes could be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLSs, of $73 million available to offset future taxable income, that we believe are not currently subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code. Our ability to use our NOLs may be limited if we undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change could be triggered by substantial changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock. For example, an ownership change would occur if certain shareholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.\nIn addition, our ability to use any NOLs depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate in future periods. The NOLs may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets, consisting primarily of net operating losses, because evidence does not indicate that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. The NOLs, if not offset against future income, will begin to expire at various dates through 2035.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers, like us, whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. The publication of such commentary has, and may in the future, cause a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. No assurances can be made that declines in the market price of our common stock will not occur in the future in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Skout Acquisition\nWe face additional risks as a result of our acquisition of Skout and may be unable to integrate our businesses successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the acquisition or do so within the anticipated timeframe.\nOn October 3, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Skout (the \u201cSkout Acquisition\u201d). The Skout Acquisition involved a combination of two companies that previously operated as independent companies, and, as a result of the Skout Acquisition, the combined company faces various additional risks, including, among others, the following:\n\u25cf\nour inability to successfully evaluate and utilize Skout\u2019s products, technology or personnel;\n\u25cf\ndisruption to Skout\u2019s business and operations and relationships with service providers, advertisers, employees and other partners;\n\u25cf\nnegative effects on our products and product pipeline from the changes and potential disruption that may follow the acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from other strategic activities;\n\u25cf\nour inability to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the Skout Acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of significant resources from the ongoing development of our existing operations; and\n\u25cf\ngreater than anticipated costs related to the integration of Skout\u2019s business and operations into ours.\nOur ability to execute all such plans will depend on various factors, many of which remain outside our control. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe process of integrating Skout\u2019s operations into our operations could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and require significant resources.\nThe following factors, among others, could reduce our revenues and earnings, increase our operating costs, and result in a loss of projected synergies:\n\u25cf\nif we are unable to successfully integrate the benefit plans, duties and responsibilities, and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business, we could lose employees to our competitors, which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration;\n\u25cf\nif we are unable to implement and retain uniform standards, controls, policies, procedures and information system; and\n\u25cf\nif the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services, or the quality of those services, we could lose users and ultimately advertisers, which would reduce our revenues and earnings.\nThe process of integrating Skout and its associated technologies involves numerous risks that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or stock price.\nThe following factors, among others, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or stock price:\n\u25cf\nexpenses related to the acquisition process and impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition;\n\u25cf\nthe dilutive effect on earnings per share as a result of issuances of stock and incurring operating losses;\n\u25cf\nstock volatility due to investors' uncertainty regarding the value of Skout;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of capital from other uses;\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in a timely manner, or at all; and\n\u25cf\nadverse outcome of litigation matters or other contingent liabilities assumed in or arising out of the acquisition.\nNotwithstanding the due diligence investigation we performed in connection with the Skout Acquisition, Skout may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection.\nWhile we performed significant due diligence on Skout prior to the Skout Acquisition, we are dependent on the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by Skout and its representatives when conducting due diligence and evaluating the results of such due diligence. We did not control and may be unaware of activities of Skout before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, policies, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nOur post-closing recourse from Skout is limited under the Merger Agreement.\nSkout\u2019s obligation to indemnify us is limited to, among others, breaches of specified representations and warranties and covenants included in the merger agreement for the Skout Acquisition (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) and other specific indemnities as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Except in the event Skout breaches a Fundamental Representation (as defined in the Merger Agreement), we cannot make a claim for indemnification pursuant to the Merger Agreement unless and until the indemnifiable losses exceed $250,000 and we cannot make a claim for a breach of a non-Fundamental Representation after the date that is 18 months after the date of closing of the Skout Acquisition. If any issues arise post-closing, we may not be entitled to sufficient, or any, indemnification or recourse from the Skout, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86989, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MEET"}
