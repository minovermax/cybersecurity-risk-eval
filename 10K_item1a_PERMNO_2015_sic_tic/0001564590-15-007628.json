The following material risk factors may cause the Company\u2019s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities.\nOur Future Success Depends on International Sales and Successful Management of Global Operations\nSales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted for approximately 63%, 65% and 56% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, we manufacture products in China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China, and maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy and South Korea. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. are subject to certain inherent risks, including fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, global economic uncertainties, tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economic instability, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences, and required compliance with U.S.- and non-U.S. laws and regulations. More specifically, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide affecting our operations outside the U.S. in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement, tax, customs, import and export requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, pensions and social insurance, employment, and environment, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive and requirements may differ among jurisdictions. Further, the promulgation of new laws, changing in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a negative impact on our business and prospects. In addition, certain laws and regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainties. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Continued Success Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes\nIn order to meet our strategic objectives, we must continue to develop, manufacture and market new products, develop new processes and improve existing processes. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. Our success in developing, introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing and product performance in the field. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.\nKeeping Pace with Key Industry Developments is Essential\nThe introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce, in a timely and cost-effective manner, new products, processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes, or that our products, applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or if they do not achieve market acceptance.\nWe May Expand Product Lines and Markets by Acquiring Other Businesses, Which May Adversely Affect our Results and Affect the Value of our Stock Following Such Acquisitions\nOur business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. We have completed various acquisitions in recent years and the success of these acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating and successfully running the businesses acquired. The strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business involves numerous potential risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired business and products, uncertainties associated with operating in new markets, working with new customers and the potential loss of the acquired company\u2019s key personnel. In addition, acquired businesses may experience operating\nlosses as of, and subsequent to, the acquisition date. Further, we significantly increased our long-term debt to finance these acquisitions, the costs of which (in terms of interest expense and similar debt service costs), must be weighed against the potential benefits of such acquisitions. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and as a result our results of operations, financial position, and cash flow may be adversely affected.\nFurther, any future business acquisitions completed by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nDeclines in the Operating Performance of One of Our Business Segments Could Result in an Impairment of the Segment\u2019s Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $195.9 million and $14.4 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists, to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nGeneral Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition\nCurrent and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. Because all components of our forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. In addition, changes in general economic conditions may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products due to economic downturn, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers\u2019 products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere; adverse effects of ongoing stagnation in the European economy; slowdown in the Chinese economy; contractions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit; and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products, increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, increase the cost and availability of financing and increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThere Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe Are Subject to Governmental Regulation\nWe are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nWe are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or\nbetween our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.\n\u00b7\nExported technology necessary to develop and manufacture certain Company products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions, and the Company may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the U.S.\n\u00b7\nOur agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.\nIn addition, failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.\nWe Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation\nWe use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment resulting from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance.\nWe have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere.\nWith respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah.\nThe generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.\nAlthough we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change Regulation\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting or contemplating enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory or voluntary, and have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly through implications on our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, costs to purchase or profits from sales of, allowances or credits under a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.\nRegulations Related to Conflict Minerals Could Adversely Impact Our Business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contain provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolframite, including their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively known as the \"covered countries\"). Pursuant to these rules, the SEC has adopted certain annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals in their products, regardless of whether such minerals were mined from the covered countries, compliance with which began in 2014. We could incur significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to our due diligence efforts to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials we use in our products, particularly if it turns out that there are only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals that are not from recycled or scrap sources, can be traced to a country of origin other than the covered countries, or can be traced to a source within the covered countries that definitely does not finance or benefit armed groups in those countries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals originating from the covered countries and we cannot definitively determine whether the conflict minerals financed or otherwise benefited armed groups, or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement.\nData Breach Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results\nIn the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property [both proprietary and of our customers], as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced an incident, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information.\nWe Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply\nWe utilize high-quality, optical grade zinc selenide (ZnSe) in the production of many of our infrared optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. No proven external sources of ZnSe are currently available. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon us. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Therefore, our inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, we produce and utilize other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (YLF), Calcium Fluoride (CaF2), Germanium (Ge), Selenium (Se), Telluride (Te), Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) and Silicon Carbide (SiC). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSome Systems That Utilize our Products Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues\nSome systems that utilize our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, and these third-party products may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers; increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses; damage to our\nbrand reputation; failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance; diversion of development and engineering resources; or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nContinued U.S. Budget Deficits Could Result in Significant Defense Spending Cuts and/or Reductions in Defense Programs, which Could Adversely Impact the Company\nSpecific to the military business within our II-VI Laser Solutions and II-VI Performance Products segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 12% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. These customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Future reductions in defense spending could result from the current or future economic or political environment, such as the ongoing sequestration of the defense budget, which could result in reductions in demand for defense-related products that we produce. Further, changes to existing defense procurement laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations. Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition.\nWe May Encounter Substantial Competition\nWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel\nWe are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNatural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Results\nWe may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nA Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries\nOur business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. This cyclical demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCommodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. As a result, the negative impact from changes in commodity prices may not be recovered through our product sales, and as such could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.\nThe Market Price of Our Common Stock Can Be Highly Volatile\nFactors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things: general economic and market conditions; actual or anticipated variations in operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 estimates or expectations; conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; and sales of our Common Stock.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. These factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nProvisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination; the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock.\nBecause We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Shareholders Will Benefit From an Investment in our Common Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our Common Stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, as we currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nRECENTLY ISSUED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued an Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update simplifies the measurement of inventory valuation at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new inventory measurement requirements are effective for the Company\u2019s 2018 fiscal year and will replace the current inventory valuation guidance that requires the use of a lower of cost or market framework. The adoption of these changes is not expected to have a material impact to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued as final, ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This update provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. The update is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The update allows for the use of either a prospective or retrospective adoption approach. Management is currently evaluating the available transition methods and the potential impact of adoption on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This ASU requires entities to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance does not address situations in which debt issuance costs do not have an associated debt liability or exceed the carrying amount of the associated debt liability. This ASU will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2017. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued as final, ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which affects reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. The update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The update allows for the use of either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective adoption approach. Management is currently evaluating the available transition methods and the potential impact of adoption on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. This ASU eliminates the requirement to separately present and disclose extraordinary and unusual items in the financial statements. This ASU will be effective beginning in 2016. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The update's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update allows for the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective approach of adoption. On July 9, 2015 the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date of the update. The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019). We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. Under the new guidance, a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted and will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax benefit when a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit carryforward Exists. The ASU changes how certain unrecognized tax benefits are to be presented on the consolidated balance sheet. This ASU clarified existing guidance to require that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except when an NOL carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward is not available under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position. In such a case, the unrecognized tax benefit would be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability. This update was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and was effective for the Company\nfor the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2014. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.", "PERMNO": 11752, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "IIVI"}
