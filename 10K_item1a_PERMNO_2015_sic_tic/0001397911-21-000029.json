Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business, operations and financial results are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We are providing the following summary of the risk factors to enhance readability of our risk factor disclosure. Material risks that may adversely affect our business and operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u2022We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors, and we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business.\n\u2022Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and other economic factors.\n\u2022Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability and financial condition.\n\u2022Any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income.\n\u2022Our business is subject to risks related to litigation, arbitration claims and regulatory actions.\n\u2022There are risks inherent in the independent broker-dealer business model.\n\u2022We rely on third-party service providers, including off-shore providers, to perform technology, processing and support functions, and our operations are dependent on financial intermediaries that we do not control.\n\u2022Lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.\n\u2022Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments.\n\u2022Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risks.\n\u2022We face competition in attracting and retaining key talent.\n\u2022The securities settlement process exposes us to risks related to adverse movements in price.\n\u2022Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs.\n\u2022Restrictions under our Credit Agreement and the Indentures governing our Notes may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business.\n\u2022Provisions of our Credit Agreement and the Indentures could discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party.\n\u2022Our insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive.\n\u2022Poor service or performance of the financial products that we offer or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products may cause clients of our advisors to withdraw their assets on short notice.\n\u2022A loss of our marketing relationships with manufacturers of financial products could harm our relationship with our advisors and, in turn, their clients.\n\u2022Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could make some of the products distributed by our advisors less attractive to clients.\n\u2022The effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have negatively affected the global economy, U.S. economy and global financial markets, and may disrupt our operations and our advisors' operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\n\u2022Any failure to comply with applicable federal or state laws or regulations exposes us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could increase our costs or negatively affect our reputation.\n\u2022Regulatory developments could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs or making our business less profitable.\n\u2022We are subject to various regulatory requirements, which, if not complied with, could result in the restriction of the conduct or growth of our business.\n\u2022Failure to comply with ERISA regulations and certain retirement plan regulations could result in penalties against us.\nRisks Related to Our Technology\n\u2022We rely on technology in our business, and technology and execution failures could subject us to losses, litigation and regulatory actions.\n\u2022Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security risks.\n\u2022Failure to maintain technological capabilities, flaws in existing technology, difficulties in upgrading our technology platform or the introduction of a competitive platform could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Inadequacy or disruption of our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures in the event of a catastrophe could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our investors.\n\u2022We are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\n\u2022Our future ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock or repurchase shares are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors, and we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business.\nWe derive a large portion of our revenues from commissions and fees generated by our advisors. Our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors has contributed significantly to our growth and success, and our strategic plan is premised upon continued growth in the number of our advisors and the assets they serve. If we fail to attract new advisors or to retain and motivate our current advisors, replace our advisors who retire, or assist our retiring advisors with transitioning their practices to existing advisors, or if advisor migration away from wirehouses to independent channels slows, our business may suffer.\nThe market for experienced and productive advisors is highly competitive, and we devote significant resources to attracting and retaining well-qualified advisors. In attracting and retaining advisors, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions such as wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and other independent broker-dealers. If we are not successful in retaining highly qualified advisors, we may not be able to recover the expense involved in attracting and training these individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the advisors needed to achieve our growth objectives.\nMore broadly, we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from:\n\u2022brokerage and investment advisory firms, including national and regional firms, as well as independent RIA firms;\n\u2022asset management firms;\n\u2022commercial banks and thrift institutions;\n\u2022insurance companies;\n\u2022other clearing/custodial technology companies; and\n\u2022investment firms offering so-called \u201crobo\u201d advice solutions.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of services and financial products across more markets. Some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do, which may give them certain competitive advantages in the services they offer. For example, certain of our competitors only provide clearing services and consequently would not have any supervision or oversight liability relating to actions of their financial advisors. We believe that competition within our industry will intensify as a result\nof consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit new advisors and retain existing advisors.\nIf we fail to continue to attract highly qualified advisors, or if advisors licensed with us leave us to pursue other opportunities, we could face a significant decline in market share, commission and fee revenues or net income. We could face similar consequences if current or potential clients of ours, including current clients that use our outsourced customized clearing, advisory platforms or technology solutions, decide to use one of our competitors rather than us. If we are required to increase our payout of commissions and fees to our advisors in order to remain competitive, our net income could be significantly reduced.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and other economic factors.\nSignificant downturns and volatility in equity and other financial markets have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic and market factors can affect our commission and fee revenues. For example, a decrease in market levels or market volatility can:\n\u2022reduce new investments by advisors\u2019 new and existing clients in financial products that are linked to the equity markets, such as variable life insurance, variable annuities, mutual funds and managed accounts;\n\u2022reduce trading activity, thereby affecting our brokerage commission revenues and our transaction revenues;\n\u2022reduce the value of advisory and brokerage assets, thereby reducing advisory fee revenues, trailing commission revenues and asset-based fee revenues; and\n\u2022motivate clients to withdraw funds from their accounts, reducing advisory and brokerage assets, advisory fee revenues and asset-based fee revenues.\nOther more specific trends may also affect our financial condition and results of operations, including, for example: changes in the mix of products preferred by investors may result in increases or decreases in our fee revenues associated with such products, depending on whether investors gravitate towards or away from such products. The timing of such trends, if any, and their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations are beyond our control.\nIn addition, because certain of our expenses are fixed, our ability to reduce them in response to market factors over short periods of time is limited, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nSignificant interest rate changes could affect our profitability and financial condition.\nOur revenues are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in fees payable to us from banks participating in our client cash programs, which are generally based on prevailing interest rates. Our revenues from our client cash programs have declined in the past as a result of a low interest rate environment, and our revenues may decline in the future due to decreases in interest rates, decreases in client cash balances or mix shifts among the current or future bank sweep vehicles and money market programs that we offer. The Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate in 2020 and there can be no assurance that it will not to do so again or maintain a low-interest rate environment for a significant period of time. Our revenues from our client cash programs also depend on our success in negotiating favorable terms in current and future agreements with banks and money market fund providers participating in our programs, as well as our success in offering competitive products, program fees and interest rates payable to clients. The expiration of contracts with favorable pricing terms, less favorable terms in future contracts with participants in our client cash programs or changes in the bank sweep vehicles or money market programs that we offer, could result in declines in our revenues. A sustained low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact upon our ability to negotiate contracts with new banks or renegotiate existing contracts on comparable terms with banks participating in our client cash programs. If interest rates do not rise, or if balances or yields in our client cash programs decrease, future revenues from our client cash programs may be lower than expected.\nAny damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income.\nWe have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity and client service, which is built upon our support for our advisors through: enabling technology, comprehensive clearing and compliance services, practice management programs and training and independent research. Our ability to attract and retain advisors and employees is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our level of service, business practices and financial condition. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including:\n\u2022litigation or regulatory actions;\n\u2022failing to deliver acceptable standards of service and quality, including technology or cybersecurity failures;\n\u2022compliance failures; and\n\u2022unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees, advisors or counterparties.\nNegative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential advisors and employees, and could lead advisors to terminate their agreements with us, which they generally have the right to do unilaterally upon short notice. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. These occurrences could lead to loss of revenues and net income.\nOur business is subject to risks related to litigation, arbitration claims and regulatory actions.\nFrom time to time, we have been subjected to and are currently subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of our business operations, including lawsuits, arbitration claims, governmental subpoenas and regulatory, governmental and self regulatory organization (\u201cSRO\u201d) inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings, as well as other actions and claims. Many of our legal claims are initiated by clients of our advisors and involve the purchase or sale of investment securities, but other claims and proceedings may be, and have been, initiated by state-level and federal regulatory authorities and SROs, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators.\nThe outcomes of any such legal or regulatory proceedings, including inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings by the SEC, FINRA, DOL and state securities regulators, are difficult to predict. A negative outcome in such a matter could result in substantial legal liability, censures, penalties and fines, disgorgement of profits, restitution to customers, remediation, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or injunctive or other equitable relief against us. Further, such negative outcomes individually or in the aggregate may cause us significant reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to recruit or retain financial advisors, or our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe may face liabilities for deficiencies or failures in our compliance systems and programs, as well as actual or alleged breaches of legal duties to our advisors\u2019 clients, including in respect of issues related to the suitability of the financial products we make available in our open architecture product platform or the investment advice of our advisors based on their clients\u2019 investment objectives and certain fiduciary obligations for advice and recommendations made to our advisory clients.\nMoreover, new and developing state and federal regulatory requirements with respect to standards of care and other obligations, as discussed under \u201cRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\u201d below, may introduce new grounds for legal claims or enforcement actions against us in the future, including, in particular with respect to our brokerage services. We may also become subject to claims, allegations and legal proceedings related to employment matters, including wage and hour, discrimination or harassment claims, or matters involving others\u2019 intellectual property or other proprietary rights, including infringement or misappropriation claims.\nThere are risks inherent in the independent broker-dealer business model.\nCompared to wirehouses and other employee model broker-dealers, we generally offer advisors wider choice in operating their businesses with regard to product offerings, outside business activities, office technology and supervisory models. Our approach may make it more challenging for us to comply with our supervisory and regulatory compliance obligations, particularly in light of our limited on-site supervision and the complexity of certain advisor business models.\nMisconduct and errors by our employees and our advisors could be difficult for us to detect and could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions, or serious reputational or financial harm. Although we have designed policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and interpretations, we cannot always\nprevent or detect misconduct and errors by our employees and our advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective in all cases. Prevention and detection among our advisors, who are typically not our direct employees and some of whom tend to be located in small, decentralized offices, present additional challenges, particularly in the case of complex products or supervision of outside business activities. In addition, although we provide our advisors with requirements and recommendations for their office technology, we cannot fully control or monitor the extent of their implementation of our requirements and recommendations. Accordingly, we cannot assure that our advisors\u2019 technology meets our standards, including with regard to information security and cybersecurity. We also cannot assure that misconduct or errors by our employees or advisors will not lead to a material adverse effect on our business, or that our errors and omissions insurance will be sufficient to cover such misconduct or errors.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, including off-shore providers, to perform technology, processing and support functions, and our operations are dependent on financial intermediaries that we do not control.\nWe rely on outsourced service providers to perform certain technology, processing and support functions. For example, we have an agreement with Refinitiv US LLC, under which it provides us key operational support, including data processing services for securities transactions and back office processing support (\u201cBETAHost\u201d). Our use of third-party service providers may decrease our ability to control operating risks and information technology systems risks.\nAny significant failures by BETAHost or our other service providers could cause us to sustain serious operational disruptions and incur losses and could harm our reputation. These third-party service providers are also susceptible to operational and technology vulnerabilities, including cyber-attacks, security breaches, fraud, phishing attacks and computer viruses, which could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data, an interruption in service or other similar events that may impact our business.\nWe cannot assure that our third-party service providers will be able to continue to provide their services in an efficient, cost-effective manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and those of our advisors. An interruption in or the cessation of service by a third-party service provider and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could cause a disruption to our business and could have a material impact on our ability to serve our advisors and their clients. In addition, we cannot predict the costs or time that would be required to find an alternative service provider.\nWe have transitioned certain business and technology processes to off-shore providers, which has increased the related risks described above. For example, we rely on several off-shore service providers, operating in multiple locations, for functions related to cash management, account transfers, information technology infrastructure and support and document indexing, among others. To the extent third-party service providers are located in foreign jurisdictions, we are exposed to risks inherent in such providers conducting business outside of the United States, including international economic and political conditions, and the additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and fluctuations in currency values.\nWe expect that our regulators would hold us responsible for any deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and for the performance of such third parties. If there were deficiencies in the oversight and control of our third-party relationships, and if our regulators held us responsible for those deficiencies, our business, reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, certain aspects of our operations are dependent on third-party financial institutions that we do not control, such as clearing agents, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. Any failure of these intermediaries, or any interruption in their operations, either on a widespread or individual basis, could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions, service our clients and manage our exposure to risk. In the event of such failure or interruption, there is no guarantee that we would be able to find adequate and cost-effective replacements on a timely basis, if at all.\nLike us, these intermediaries are exposed to risks related to fluctuations and volatility in the financial markets and broader economy, as well as specific operational risks related to their business, such as those related to technology, security and the prevailing regulatory environment. Because we rely on these intermediaries, we share indirect exposure to these risks. If these risks were to materialize, or if there was a widespread perception that they could materialize, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition.\nLiquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. We expend significant resources investing in our business, particularly with respect to our technology and service platforms. In addition, we must maintain certain levels of required capital. As a result, reduced levels of liquidity could have a significant negative effect on us. Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include:\n\u2022illiquid or volatile markets;\n\u2022diminished access to debt or capital markets;\n\u2022unforeseen cash or capital requirements;\n\u2022regulatory penalties or fines, settlements, customer restitution or other remediation costs; or\n\u2022adverse legal settlements or judgments.\nThe capital and credit markets continue to experience varying degrees of volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for businesses similar to ours. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be required to limit or curtail our operations or growth plans, and our business would suffer.\nWe may sometimes be required to fund timing differences arising from the delayed receipt of client funds associated with the settlement of client transactions in securities markets. These timing differences are funded either with internally generated cash flow or, if needed, with funds drawn under our revolving credit facility, the committed revolving credit facility at our broker-dealer subsidiary, LPL Financial, or uncommitted lines of credit. We may also need access to capital in connection with the growth of our business, through acquisitions or otherwise.\nIn the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may need to rely on financing sources such as bank debt. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as:\n\u2022market conditions;\n\u2022the general availability of credit;\n\u2022the volume of trading activities;\n\u2022the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry;\n\u2022our credit ratings and credit capacity; and\n\u2022the possibility that our lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects as a result of industry- or company-specific considerations. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating organizations take negative actions against us.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate commission, fee and other market-related revenues to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments.\nWe have made acquisitions and investments in the past and may pursue further acquisitions and investments in the future. These transactions are accompanied by risks. For instance, an acquisition could have a negative effect on our financial and strategic position and reputation or the acquired business could fail to further our strategic goals. We can provide no assurances that advisors who join LPL Financial through acquisitions or investments in advisor practices will remain at LPL Financial. Moreover, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into ours, and therefore we may not be able to realize the intended benefits from an acquisition. We may have a lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies brought on by the acquisition and we may have an initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners. An acquisition may create an impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our advisors or suppliers. All of these and other potential risks may serve as a diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn December 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary LPL Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLPL Holdings\u201d) entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Macquarie Management Holdings, Inc. (\u201cMacquarie\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreement, LPL Holdings will acquire the wealth management business of Waddell & Reed\nFinancial, Inc. (\u201cWaddell & Reed\u201d), upon completion of Macquarie\u2019s acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Waddell & Reed.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2021, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed timely or at all due to several factors, including, but not limited to: the failure of the parties to satisfy the closing conditions in the Purchase Agreement in a timely manner or at all, including the completion of the acquisition of Waddell & Reed by Macquarie, obtaining the required stockholder and regulatory approvals and the retention by Waddell & Reed of minimum assets prior to closing. Further, several factors could negatively affect our ability to fully realize the revenue or expense synergies or the other expected benefits of the transaction, including, but not limited to: difficulties and delays in recruiting Waddell & Reed financial advisors or onboarding the clients or businesses of Waddell & Reed financial advisors to our platforms, challenges in separating the operations of Waddell & Reed\u2019s wealth management business from the operations to be retained by Macquarie and disruptions to our or Waddell & Reed\u2019s businesses as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transactions.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risks.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our operational risk. These policies and procedures, however, may not be effective and may not be adapted quickly enough to respond effectively to changed circumstances. Some of our compliance and risk evaluation functions depend upon information technology systems, information provided by others and public information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are otherwise accessible by us. In some cases, however, that information may not be available, accurate, complete or up-to-date. Also, because many of our advisors work in decentralized offices, additional risk management challenges may exist, including with regard to advisor office technology and information security practices. In addition, our existing systems, policies and procedures, and staffing levels may be insufficient to support a significant increase in our advisor population. Any such increase could require us to increase our costs, including information technology costs, in order to maintain our compliance and risk management obligations, or strain our existing policies and procedures as we evolve to support a larger advisor population. If our systems, policies and procedures are not effective, or if we are not successful in capturing risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe face competition in attracting and retaining key talent.\nOur success depends upon the continued services of our key senior management personnel, including our executive officers and senior managers. Each of our executive officers is an employee at will, and none has an employment agreement. The loss of one or more of our key senior management personnel, and the failure to recruit a suitable replacement or replacements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, our success and future growth depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. There is significant competition for qualified employees in the broker-dealer industry, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover. The loss or unavailability of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe securities settlement process exposes us to risks related to adverse movements in price.\nLPL Financial provides clearing services and trade processing for our advisors and their clients and certain financial institutions. Broker-dealers that clear their own trades are subject to substantially more regulatory requirements than brokers that outsource these functions to third-party providers. Errors in performing clearing functions, including clerical, technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of our advisors\u2019 clients, could lead to censures, fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities, as well as losses and liabilities in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by our advisors\u2019 clients and others. Any unsettled securities transactions or wrongly executed transactions may expose our advisors and us to losses resulting from adverse movements in the prices of such securities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $2.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion is subject to floating interest rates. Our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It could also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on\nour indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. In addition, our level of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. If interest rates increase, our interest expense would increase because borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) are based on variable interest rates.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful or feasible. Our Credit Agreement restricts our ability to sell assets. Even if we could consummate those sales, the proceeds that we realize from them may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Furthermore, if an event of default were to occur with respect to our Credit Agreement or other future indebtedness, our creditors could, among other things, accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness.\nOur Credit Agreement and the indentures (as supplemented, \u201cIndentures\u201d) governing our senior unsecured notes (as defined further below, the \u201cNotes\u201d) permit us to incur additional indebtedness. Under our Credit Agreement, we have the right to request additional commitments for new term loans, new revolving credit commitments and increases to then-existing term loans and revolving credit commitments, subject to certain limitations. Although the Credit Agreement and the Indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d as defined in the Credit Agreement or the Indentures. To the extent new debt or other obligations are added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial indebtedness risks described above would increase.\nA credit rating downgrade would not impact the terms of our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement or the Indentures. However, any such downgrade would negatively impact our ability to obtain comparable rates and terms on any future refinancing of our debt and could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, if such downgrade were to occur, or if ratings agencies indicated that a downgrade may occur, perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged, which could affect our client relationships and decrease the number of investors, clients and counterparties that do business with us.\nRestrictions under our Credit Agreement and the Indentures governing our Notes may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business.\nOur Credit Agreement and the Indentures contain customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that may restrict us from:\n\u2022incurring additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022declaring dividends or other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022repurchasing equity interests;\n\u2022redeeming indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to certain debt instruments;\n\u2022making investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022creating liens;\n\u2022selling assets;\n\u2022guaranteeing indebtedness;\n\u2022engaging in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022entering into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries; and\n\u2022consolidating, merging or transferring all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under our Credit Agreement or the Indentures, as applicable, and payment of the indebtedness could be accelerated. Acceleration of our indebtedness under our Credit Agreement or the Indentures may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay that indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business could be materially\nand adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nProvisions of our Credit Agreement and the Indentures could discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party.\nCertain provisions of our Credit Agreement and the Indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third-party to acquire us, and any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change of control, all indebtedness under our Credit Agreement may be accelerated and become due and payable and noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the purchase date. A potential acquirer may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase our outstanding indebtedness in connection with a change of control.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive.\nWe are subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. These claims may involve substantial amounts of money and involve significant defense costs. It is not always possible to prevent or detect activities giving rise to claims, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases.\nWe maintain voluntary and required insurance coverage, including, among others, general liability, property, director and officer, excess-SIPC, business interruption, cyber and data breach, errors and omissions and fidelity bond insurance. We have self-insurance for certain potential liabilities through a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. While we endeavor to self-insure and purchase coverage that is appropriate based on our assessment of our risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. Assessing the probability of a loss occurring and the timing and amount of any loss related to a regulatory matter or a legal proceeding is inherently difficult, and there are particular uncertainties and complexities involved when assessing the adequacy of loss reserves for potential liabilities that are self-insured by our captive insurance subsidiary. In addition, certain types of potential claims for damages cannot be insured. Our business may be negatively affected if in the future some or all of our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable to cover our liabilities related to legal or regulatory matters. Such negative consequences could include additional expense and financial loss, which could be significant in amount. In addition, insurance claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.\nPoor service or performance of the financial products that we offer or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products may cause clients of our advisors to withdraw their assets on short notice.\nClients of our advisors have control over their assets that are served under our platforms. Poor service or performance of the financial products that we offer, the emergence of new financial products or services from others, harm to our reputation or competitive pressures on pricing of such services or products may result in the loss of clients. In addition, we must monitor the pricing of our services and financial products in relation to competitors and periodically may need to adjust commission and fee rates, interest rates on deposits and margin loans and other fee structures to remain competitive. Competition from other financial services firms, such as reduced or zero commissions to attract clients or trading volume, direct-to-investor online financial services, including so-called \u201crobo\u201d advice, or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances, could result in pricing pressure or otherwise adversely impact our business. The decrease in revenues that could result from such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA loss of our marketing relationships with manufacturers of financial products could harm our relationship with our advisors and, in turn, their clients.\nWe operate on an open architecture product platform offering no proprietary financial products. To help our advisors meet their clients\u2019 needs with suitable investment options, we have relationships with many of the industry-leading providers of financial and insurance products. We have sponsorship agreements with some manufacturers of fixed and variable annuities and mutual funds that, subject to the survival of certain terms and conditions, may be terminated by the manufacturer upon notice. If we lose our relationships with one or more of these manufacturers, our ability to serve our advisors and, in turn, their clients, and our business, may be materially adversely affected. As an example, certain variable annuity product sponsors have ceased offering and issuing new variable annuity contracts. If this trend continues, we could experience a loss in the revenues currently generated from the sale of such products. In addition, certain features of such contracts have been eliminated by variable annuity product\nsponsors. If this trend continues, the attractiveness of these products would be reduced, potentially reducing the revenues we currently generate from the sale of such products.\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could make some of the products distributed by our advisors less attractive to clients.\nSome of the financial products distributed by our advisors, such as variable annuities, enjoy favorable treatment under current U.S. federal income tax law. Changes in U.S. federal income tax law, in particular with respect to variable annuity products, or with respect to tax rates on capital gains or dividends, could make some of these products less attractive to clients and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.\nThe effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have negatively affected the global economy, U.S. economy and global financial markets, and may disrupt our operations and our advisors' operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the international and U.S. economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain it have resulted in illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, increased unemployment, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. Impacts on our business could be wide-ranging, and material impacts are possible, including the following:\n\u2022Employees contracting COVID-19, including unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business operations\n\u2022A prolonged downturn in equity and other financial markets, which would adversely affect our advisory, asset-based and trailing commission revenues\n\u2022A sustained low interest rate environment, which would reduce revenues from our client cash programs included in asset-based revenues\n\u2022Reductions in our service levels or operating effectiveness as a substantial majority of our employees are working remotely in response to the pandemic\n\u2022Failure of our information technology systems, which could result in interruptions or errors in performing securities clearing and custody functions, as a result of extraordinary trading volumes, malware, ransomware or malicious cyber activity\n\u2022Disruptions in technology, processing or support functions as our outsourced service providers or other vendors, including off-shore providers, experience disruptions in their business operations\n\u2022Reduction in our ability to recruit advisors or otherwise execute our growth plans due to travel restrictions, limitations on interpersonal contact and challenging macro economic conditions\n\u2022Closure of our offices or the offices of our advisors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to contain it have also resulted in increased volatility. The further spread of COVID-19 and attempts to curtail it by limiting interpersonal activity, including business activity, may increase instability in domestic and international financial markets and materially disrupt general economic and financial activity. Significant disruptions in financial markets could result in a decline in demand for the products and services offered by our advisors to their clients, or their ability to provide them, which would negatively impact our and their financial results and growth strategy.\nIn addition, an overall decline in equity market prices will generally reduce the value of advisory and brokerage assets, which has previously resulted and may in the future result in a reduction in the advisory fees, asset-based fees and trailing commissions we are entitled to receive. Moreover, in response to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate by 150 basis points in March 2020 and there is a substantial likelihood that interest rates will remain low while global economic activity is suppressed. The reduction in prevailing interest rates has in turn reduced, and will continue to reduce, our revenues from our client cash programs and may affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms in future agreements with banks and money market fund providers that participate in our programs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also jeopardize our ability to rely on our outsourced service providers, including those that operate off-shore. As COVID-19 has spread, governments in the United States and around the\nworld, including in jurisdictions where our service providers have operations, have from time to time imposed or encouraged varying degrees of limitations on travel and social interaction. In many cases this has resulted in the partial or complete closure of businesses, including some that we rely on. While we have taken steps to minimize the disruptions that these closures have caused, and are seeking to avoid interruptions to our critical operations, there can be no guarantee that they will be effective, or, if they are effective, that such effect will be sustained or cost-effective. In addition, if business closures are prolonged or become more widespread, our ability to modify our operations to avoid interruption may become more limited or costly. Any interruption to our operations could have a negative effect on our reputation and results of operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented significant elements of our business continuity plans, and have begun relying on capabilities that we previously put into place to support these plans. While we believe that these plans and their implementation have helped avoid significant interruptions to our critical services, there can be no assurance that they will be able to do so on a sustained or uninterrupted basis, and reliance on such plans could expose our business to other operational risks. For example, while we have taken steps to ensure that our remote-work solutions are reliable and secure, especially those related to the handling, transmission, storage and disposal of sensitive personal or confidential information, there can be no assurance that these solutions will be used or function as intended, or that they will be completely effective in preventing interruptions in our services or cybersecurity incidents. In addition, there can be no assurance that the third parties that provide and maintain some of these solutions will be able to do so on a sustained and uninterrupted basis. Because we do not control these third parties, we are subject to the limitations, deficiencies and vulnerabilities of their services, products, and operations. Any compromise, failure, or interruption in the availability of the solutions that support our remote-work operations could directly or indirectly result in cybersecurity incidents, interruptions to our business, and negative effects on our reputation and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nAny failure to comply with applicable federal or state laws or regulations exposes us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could increase our costs or negatively affect our reputation.\nOur business, including securities and investment advisory services, is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Our broker-dealer subsidiary, LPL Financial, is:\n\u2022registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands;\n\u2022registered as an investment adviser with the SEC;\n\u2022a member of FINRA and various other self-regulatory organizations, and a participant in various clearing organizations, including the Depository Trust Company, the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Options Clearing Corporation;\n\u2022regulated by the DOL relative to its servicing of retirement plan accounts subject to ERISA and the Code; and\n\u2022regulated by the CFTC with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker.\nThe primary self-regulator of LPL Financial is FINRA. LPL Financial is also subject to state laws, including state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, and the rules of Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board for its municipal securities activities. The CFTC has designated the NFA as LPL Financial\u2019s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities.\nThe SEC, FINRA, DOL, the CFTC, the OCC, various securities and futures exchanges and other United States and state-level governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws, regulations or interpretations. There can be no assurance that other federal or state agencies will not attempt to further regulate our business or that specific interactions with foreign countries or foreign nationals will not trigger regulation in non-U.S. law in particular circumstances. These legislative and regulatory initiatives may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business model less profitable.\nOur ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the laws, rules and regulations promulgated by federal regulatory bodies and the regulatory authorities in each of the states and other jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and interpretations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and\nreporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, audit, supervisory and risk management personnel. We cannot assure you that our systems and procedures are, or have been, effective in complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and interpretations. In particular, the diversity of information security environments in which our services are offered makes it difficult to ensure a uniformly robust level of compliance. Regulators have in the past raised, and may in the future raise, concerns with respect to the quality, consistency or oversight of our compliance systems and programs and our past or future compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have a number of pending regulatory matters.\nViolations of laws, rules or regulations and settlements in respect of alleged violations have in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, legal liability, censures, penalties and fines, disgorgement of profits, restitution to customers, remediation, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or injunctive or other equitable relief against us, which individually or in the aggregate could negatively impact our financial results or adversely affect our ability to attract or retain financial advisors and institutions. Depending on the nature of the violation, we may be required to offer restitution or remediation to customers, and the costs of doing so could exceed our loss reserves.\nWe have established a captive insurance subsidiary that underwrites insurance for various regulatory and legal risks, although self-insurance coverage is not available for all matters. The availability of coverage depends on the nature of the claim and the adequacy of reserves, which depends in part on historical claims experience, including the actual timing and costs of resolving matters that begin in one policy period and are resolved in a subsequent period. Assessing the probability of a loss occurring and the timing and amount of any loss related to a regulatory matter or a legal proceeding is inherently difficult and requires significant and complex judgments, which may include the procedural status of the matter and any recent developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar matters; the size and nature of potential exposures; available defenses; the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts; potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions; as well as the potential for insurance coverage and indemnification, if available. There are particular uncertainties and complexities involved when assessing the adequacy of loss reserves for potential liabilities that are self-insured by our captive insurance subsidiary. As a result, actual self-insurance liabilities could exceed our loss reserves, in which case coverage may not be available and we could incur material additional expense.\nRegulatory developments could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs or making our business less profitable.\nOur profitability could be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally and, in particular, our advisors and their clients, including changes to the interpretation or enforcement of laws governing standards of care applicable to investment advice and recommendations, taxation, the classification of our independent advisors as independent contractors rather than our employees, trading, electronic commerce, privacy, data protection and anti-money laundering. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations could subject us to regulatory actions or litigation and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nNew laws, rules and regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, rules or regulations, could also result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct or plan to conduct, modifications to our current or future business practices, compressed margins, increased capital requirements and additional costs. For example, in June 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation BI, which imposes an overarching standard of conduct that requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to act in the best interest of their retail customers when making securities recommendations and imposes a number of new compliance and disclosure obligations on broker-dealers. Nevada has enacted, and other state legislatures (including New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland) are considering, statutes that impose fiduciary standards and other obligations on broker-dealers and investment advisers operating in their states. New York recently adopted a best interest standard that became applicable to the sale of certain annuity and insurance products beginning August 1, 2019. We expect that these laws and proposals could negatively impact our results, including by increasing our expenditures related to legal, compliance, information technology, and could result in other costs, including greater risks of client lawsuits and enforcement activity by regulators. These changes may also affect the array of products and services we offer to clients and the compensation that we and our advisors receive in connection with such products and services.\nIt is also unclear how and whether other regulators, including FINRA, the DOL, banking regulators and other state securities and insurance regulators may respond to, or enforce elements of, these new regulations, or develop their own similar laws and regulations. The impacts, degree and timing of the effect of these laws and future regulations on our business cannot now be anticipated or planned for, and may have further impacts on our\nproducts and services and the results of operations. Please consult the Retirement Plan Services Regulation section within Part I, \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for specific information about risks associated with DOL regulations and related exemptions and their potential impact on our operations.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act enacted wide-ranging changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants, reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading, enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures and provide for greater protections to individual consumers and investors. Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by the applicable regulatory agencies. Compliance with these provisions could require us to review our product and service offerings for potential changes and would likely result in increased compliance costs. Moreover, to the extent the Dodd-Frank Act affects the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of financial institutions with which we do business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us. The ultimate impact that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us, the financial industry and the economy cannot be known until all such applicable regulations called for under the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized and implemented.\nLikewise, federal and state standards prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, including those related to the Americans with Disabilities Act, are evolving to require an increasing number of public spaces, including web-based applications, to be made accessible to the disabled. As a result, we could be required to make modifications to our internet-based applications or to our other client- or advisor-facing technologies, including our website, to provide enhanced or accessible service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons. This adaptation of our websites and web-based applications and materials could result in increased costs and may affect the products and services we provide. Failure to comply with federal or state standards could result in litigation, including class action lawsuits.\nIn sum, our profitability may be adversely affected by current and future rulemaking and enforcement activity by the various federal, state and self-regulatory organizations to which we are subject. The effect of these regulatory developments on our business cannot now be anticipated or planned for, but may have further impacts on our products and services and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various regulatory requirements, which, if not complied with, could result in the restriction of the conduct or growth of our business.\nThe business activities that we may conduct are limited by various regulatory agencies. Our membership agreement with FINRA may be amended by application to include additional business activities. This application process is time-consuming and may not be successful. As a result, we may be prevented from entering new potentially profitable businesses in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, as a member of FINRA, we are subject to certain regulations regarding changes in control. FINRA Rule 1017 generally provides, among other things, that FINRA approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a 25% or more change in our ownership that results in one person or entity directly or indirectly owning or controlling 25% or more of us. Similarly, the OCC imposes advance approval requirements for a change of control, and control is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more of our common stock. These regulatory approval processes can result in delay, increased costs or impose additional transaction terms in connection with a proposed change of control, such as capital contributions to the regulated entity. As a result of these regulations, our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited.\nIn addition, the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the OCC and the NFA have extensive rules and regulations with respect to capital requirements. As a registered broker-dealer, LPL Financial is subject to Rule 15c3-1 (\u201cNet Capital Rule\u201d) under the Exchange Act, and related requirements of SROs. The CFTC and the NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Because our holding companies are not registered broker-dealers, they are not subject to the Net Capital Rule. However, the ability of our holding companies to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer subsidiary could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt, redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock or pay dividends. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our present levels of business.\nFailure to comply with ERISA regulations and certain retirement plan regulations could result in penalties against us.\nAs discussed above, we are subject to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as we provide services with respect to plan clients, or otherwise deal with plan clients that are subject to ERISA or the Code. ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are \u201cfiduciaries\u201d (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) and prohibits certain transactions involving plans subject to ERISA and fiduciaries or other service providers to such plans. Non-compliance with or breaches of these provisions may expose an ERISA fiduciary or other service provider to liability under ERISA, which may include monetary and criminal penalties as well as equitable remedies for the affected plan. Section 4975 of the Code prohibits certain transactions involving \u201cplans\u201d (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1)), which include, for example, IRAs and certain Keogh plans, and service providers, including fiduciaries (as defined in Section 4975(e)(3)) to such plans. Section 4975 also imposes excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions. Our failure to comply with ERISA and the Code could result in significant penalties against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business (or, in a worst case, severely limit the extent to which we could act as fiduciaries for or provide services to these plans).\nRisks Related to Our Technology\nWe rely on technology in our business, and technology and execution failures could subject us to losses, litigation and regulatory actions.\nOur business relies extensively on electronic data processing, storage and communications systems. In addition to better serving our advisors and their clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms like ours to reduce costs and support our regulatory compliance and reporting functions. Our continued success will depend, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022continue to invest significant resources on our technology systems in order to meet industry and regulatory standards, consumer preferences and the efforts of threat actors to penetrate our systems;\n\u2022successfully maintain and upgrade the capabilities of our systems;\n\u2022address the needs of our advisors and their clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands while ensuring the security of the data involving those products and services;\n\u2022use technology effectively and securely to support our regulatory compliance and reporting functions;\n\u2022comply with the changing landscape of laws and regulations that govern protection of personally identifiable information; and\n\u2022retain skilled information technology employees.\nExtraordinary trading volumes, malware, ransomware or attempts by hackers to introduce large volumes of fraudulent transactions into our systems, beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes, could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Failure of our systems, which could result from these or other events beyond our control, or an inability or failure to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services, could result in financial losses, unanticipated disruptions in our service, liability to our advisors or advisors\u2019 clients, compliance failures, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, including personally identifiable information of advisors and their clients, as well as our employees. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks are to some degree vulnerable to unauthorized access, human error, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code, spam attacks, phishing, ransomware or other forms of social engineering and other events that could impact the security, reliability, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems. To the extent third parties, such as product sponsors, also retain similarity sensitive information about our advisors or their clients, their systems may face similar vulnerabilities. We are not able to protect against these events completely given the rapid evolution of new vulnerabilities, the complex and distributed nature of our systems, our interdependence on the systems of other companies and the increased sophistication of potential attack vectors and methods against our systems. In particular, advisors work in a wide variety of environments, and although we require minimum security by policy, we cannot ensure the consistent compliance with these policies across all of our advisors, or that our policy will be adequate to address the evolving threat environment. If one or more of these events occur, they could jeopardize our own, our advisors\u2019 or their clients\u2019, or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed, stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own, our advisors\u2019 or their clients\u2019,\nour counterparties\u2019, or third parties\u2019 operations. As a result, we could be subject to litigation, client loss, reputational harm, regulatory sanctions and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain. If any person, including any of our employees or advisors, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could also be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to security risks.\nThe secure transmission of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, over public networks is a critical element of our operations. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about clients of our advisors, our advisors and our employees, as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. The risks related to transmitting data and using service providers outside of and storing or processing data within our network are increasing based on escalating and malicious cyber activity, including activity that originates outside of the United States from criminal elements and hostile nation-states.\nCybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats and is subject to federal and state regulation relating to the protection of confidential information. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, to make required notifications, or to update our technologies, websites and web-based applications to comply with industry and regulatory standards, but we may not have adequate personnel, financial or other resources to fully meet these standards. We will also be required to effectively and efficiently govern, manage and ensure timely evolutions in our systems, including in their design, architecture and interconnections as well as their organizational and technical protections. New regulations may be promulgated by relevant federal and state authorities at any time and compliance with regulatory expectations may become increasingly complex as more state regulatory authorities issue or amend regulations, which sometimes conflict, governing handling of confidential information by companies within their jurisdiction. Several states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Michigan, Nevada, New York, South Carolina and Vermont, have promulgated cybersecurity requirements that impact our compliance obligations. Compliance with these regulations also could be costly and disruptive to our operations, and we cannot provide assurance that the impact of these regulations would not, either individually or collectively, be material to our business.\nOur application service provider systems maintain and process confidential data on behalf of advisors and their clients, some of which is critical to our advisors\u2019 business operations. If our application service provider systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, or if our systems or facilities are infiltrated or damaged by unauthorized persons or malicious computer code, we or our advisors could experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, regulatory violations, class action and commercial litigation and significant business interruption or loss. In addition, vulnerabilities of our external service providers could pose security risks to client information. If any such disruption or failure, real or perceived, occurs, we or our advisors may be exposed to unexpected liability, advisors or their clients may withdraw assets, our reputation may be tarnished and there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Further, any actual or perceived breach or cybersecurity attack directed at other financial institutions or financial services companies, whether or not we are targeted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in the use of technology to conduct financial transactions, which could negatively impact us, including the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and technology infrastructure. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur own information technology systems are to some degree vulnerable to unauthorized access and other security risks. We rely on our advisors and employees to comply with our policies and procedures to safeguard confidential data. The failure of our advisors and employees to comply with such policies and procedures, either intentionally or unintentionally, could result in the loss or wrongful use of their clients\u2019 confidential information or other sensitive information. In addition, even if we and our advisors comply with our policies and procedures, persons who circumvent security measures could infiltrate or damage our systems or facilities and wrongfully use our confidential information or clients\u2019 confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Cyber-attacks can be designed to collect information, manipulate, destroy or corrupt data, applications, or accounts and to disable the functioning or use of applications or technology assets. Such activity could, among other things:\n\u2022seriously damage our reputation;\n\u2022allow competitors or hackers access to our proprietary business information;\n\u2022subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data;\n\u2022result in the termination of relationships with our advisors;\n\u2022subject us to regulatory sanctions or obligations, based on state law or the authority of the SEC and FINRA to enforce regulations regarding business continuity planning or cybersecurity;\n\u2022subject us to litigation by consumers, advisors or other business partners that may suffer damages as a result of such activity;\n\u2022result in inaccurate financial data reporting; and\n\u2022require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.\nAs malicious cyber activity escalates, including activity that originates outside of the United States, the risks we face relating to transmission of data and our use of service providers outside of our network, as well as the storing or processing of data within our network, intensify. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance does not cover certain types of potential losses and, for covered losses, may not be sufficient in amount to protect us against all such losses.\nIn the course of operations, we share sensitive corporate and personal data with vendors, third parties and other financial institutions. Although we conduct some level of due diligence before sharing data with third parties, this due diligence may not uncover administrative, technical or electronic gaps or flaws in their processes or systems. In 2018, we experienced a limited breach of information security at a vendor, which led to notification costs and potential reputational harm with regulators, current and potential advisors and advisors\u2019 clients. We also experienced an incident at another financial institution which held advisor data in the normal course of operations. Similar incidents in the future could lead to litigation involving other financial institutions, class actions, regulatory investigations or other harm.\nIn light of the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of our advisors and their clients, the diversity of our advisors\u2019 security environments and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors, a cyber-attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber-attack could take substantial amounts of time, and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information. In some cases, the nature of the attack may be such that full and reliable information may never be available. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.\nFailure to maintain technological capabilities, flaws in existing technology, difficulties in upgrading our technology platform or the introduction of a competitive platform could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements required to meet the changing demands of our advisors and their clients. We depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technology to support our business functions, including among others:\n\u2022securities trading and custody;\n\u2022portfolio management;\n\u2022performance reporting;\n\u2022customer service;\n\u2022accounting and internal financial processes and controls; and\n\u2022regulatory compliance and reporting.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to effectively adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet changing client, industry and regulatory demands. The emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing systems obsolete or uncompetitive. There cannot be any assurance that another company will not design a similar or better platform that renders our technology less competitive.\nMaintaining competitive technology requires us to make significant capital expenditures, both in the near term and longer-term. There cannot be any assurance that we will have sufficient resources to adequately update and expand our information technology systems or capabilities, or offer our services on the personal and mobile computing devices that may be preferred by our advisors and/or their clients, nor can there be any assurance that any upgrade or expansion efforts will be sufficiently timely, successful, secure and accepted by our current and prospective advisors or their clients. The process of upgrading and expanding our systems has at times caused,\nand may in the future cause, us to suffer system degradations, outages and failures. If our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of advisors and could harm our reputation. A breakdown in advisors\u2019 systems could have similar effects. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our advisors and their clients. Security, stability and regulatory risks also exist because parts of our infrastructure and software are beyond their manufacturer\u2019s stated end of life. We are working to mitigate such risks through additional controls and increased modernization spending, although we cannot provide assurance that our risk mitigation efforts will be effective, in whole or in part.\nInadequacy or disruption of our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures in the event of a catastrophe could adversely affect our business.\nWe have made a significant investment in our infrastructure, and our operations are dependent on our ability to protect the continuity of our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster, breach of security, human error, loss of power, computer and/or telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made events. A catastrophic event could have a direct negative impact on us by adversely affecting our advisors, employees or facilities, or an indirect impact on us by adversely affecting the financial markets or the overall economy. While we have implemented business continuity and disaster recovery plans and maintain business interruption insurance, it is impossible to fully anticipate and protect against all potential catastrophes. In addition, we depend on the adequacy of the business continuity and disaster recovery plans of our third-party service providers, including off-shore service providers, in order to prevent or mitigate service interruptions. If our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and procedures, or those of our third-party service providers, were disrupted or unsuccessful in the event of a catastrophe, we could experience a material adverse interruption of our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our investors.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this Item 1A):\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations, including with regard to interest rates or revenues associated with our client cash programs or key business lines;\n\u2022variance in our financial performance from the expectations of equity research analysts;\n\u2022conditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u2022announcements of significant new services or products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022additions or changes to key personnel;\n\u2022the commencement or outcome of litigation or arbitration proceedings;\n\u2022the commencement or outcome of regulatory actions, including settlements with the SEC, FINRA, DOL or state securities regulators;\n\u2022changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022future sales of our equity securities;\n\u2022changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u2022legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions, including developments related to the \u201cbest interest\u201d and \u201cfiduciary\u201d standards of care;\n\u2022political developments; and\n\u2022general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected\ncompany. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and derive all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. In addition, FINRA regulations restrict dividends in excess of 10% of a member firm\u2019s excess net capital without FINRA\u2019s prior approval. Compliance with this regulation may impede our ability to receive dividends from our broker-dealer subsidiary.\nOur future ability to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock or repurchase shares are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.\nOur board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in 2020 and has from time to time authorized us to repurchase shares of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The declaration and payment of any future quarterly cash dividend or any additional repurchase authorizations will be subject to the board of directors\u2019 continuing determination that the declaration of future dividends or repurchase of our shares are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with our Credit Agreement, the Indentures and applicable law. Such determinations will depend upon a number of factors that the board of directors deems relevant, including future earnings, the success of our business activities, capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, the general financial condition and future prospects of our business and general business conditions.\nThe future payment of dividends or repurchases of shares will also depend on our ability to generate earnings and cash flows. If we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase additional shares. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock and repurchase shares is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, including compliance with limitations under our Credit Agreement and the Indentures. Our broker-dealer subsidiary is subject to requirements of the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC and other regulators relating to liquidity, capital standards and the use of client funds and securities, which may limit funds available for the payment of dividends to us.", "PERMNO": 12400, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "LPLA"}
