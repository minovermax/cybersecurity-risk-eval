{"cik": "1375151", "company": "ZOGENIX, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Merger Agreement\nThe conditions under the Merger Agreement to Parent\u2019s consummation of the Offer and our subsequent Merger with Purchaser may not be satisfied at all or in the anticipated timeframe.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of Parent\u2019s pending Offer and subsequent Merger is subject to customary conditions. Satisfaction of certain of the conditions is not within our control, and difficulties in otherwise satisfying the conditions may prevent, delay, or otherwise materially adversely affect the consummation of the pending Offer and subsequent Merger. These conditions include, among other things, (i) there having been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not validly withdrawn, as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent or Merger Sub, represents at least a majority of the Company Shares then outstanding; (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to certain materiality qualifications; (iii) the Company\u2019s compliance in all material respects with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement; (iv) the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer or the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of any other clearance, approval or consent applicable to Offer or the Merger (as defined below) under any applicable antitrust law; (v) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that is continuing; and (vi) the absence of any law, regulation, order, injunction or ruling issued or enacted by any government authority of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or that would impose certain remedies or restrictions on the ability of Parent to fully own or operate the Company, its businesses or assets. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required conditions will be satisfied. If the Merger does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs delaying or preventing the Merger, such delay or failure to complete the Merger may create uncertainty or otherwise have negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the price per share for our common stock.\nWhile Parent\u2019s Offer and the proposed Merger are pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could disrupt our business.\nWhether or not the pending Offer and subsequent Merger is consummated, the Merger may disrupt our current plans and operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The pendency of the pending Offer and subsequent Merger may also divert management\u2019s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations, and our employees and other key personnel may have uncertainties about the effect of the pending Offer and subsequent Merger, and the uncertainties may impact our ability to retain, recruit, and hire key personnel while the Merger is pending or if it fails to close.\nThe preparations for the consummation of the Merger have placed and we expect will continue to place a significant burden on many of our management, employees and on our internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from operating our business in the ordinary course could adversely affect our financial results. Also, if, despite our efforts, key personnel depart because of these uncertainties and burdens, or because they do not wish to remain with the combined company, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses due to legal, advisory, printing and financial services fees related to the Merger. These expenses must be paid regardless of whether the Merger is consummated, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 31\nFurthermore, we cannot predict how our business partners will view or react to the pending Offer and subsequent Merger upon consummation. If we are unable to reassure our business partners to continue transacting business with us, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business and operations in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and also restricts us from taking certain actions without Parent\u2019s prior written consent during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger (or the date on which the Merger Agreement is earlier terminated). For these and other reasons, the pendency of the proposed Merger could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests in the tender offer and merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include direct or indirect ownership of our common stock and stock options, the acceleration of stock options upon consummation of the transactions and other interests. Such interests of our directors and executive officers are set forth in further detail in the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company with the SEC on February 1, 2022.\nLitigation filed or that may be filed against us and/or the members of our board of directors could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger.\nLawsuits filed, or that may be filed, could delay or prevent our acquisition by Parent, divert the attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business and otherwise adversely affect us financially. The outcome of any lawsuit filed or that may be filed challenging the Merger is uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that there shall not be in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, in each case issued by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, if any lawsuit (including but not limited to the legal proceedings discussed in this report in Part I, Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d) is successful in obtaining an order enjoining the Merger, then the Merger may not be consummated within the expected time frame, or at all, and could result in substantial costs, including but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers.\nOur stockholders may not receive any payment on the CVRs and the CVRs may otherwise expire valueless.\nIf the Merger is completed, we and certain other parties will enter into the CVR Agreement pursuant to which, for each share of our common stock held, our stockholders of record as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will receive one non-transferrable CVR entitling such holders to receive the Milestone Payment if, and only if, no later than December 31, 2023, the Milestone is achieve. Parent is obligated only to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the Milestone following the closing of the Merger and there can be no assurance that the Milestone will be achieved or that the Milestone Payment will be made. In addition, the CVRs will not be transferable, will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will not accrue on any amounts potentially payable on the CVRs. Accordingly, the right of any of our stockholders to receive any future payment on or derive any value form the CVRs will be contingent solely upon the achievement of the Milestone Event within the time periods specified in the CVR Agreement and if these events are not achieved for any reason within the time periods specified in the CVR Agreement, no payments will be made under the CVRs, and the CVRs will expire valueless.\nIn the event that the Merger is not consummated, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nThe conditions to the consummation of the pending Offer and subsequent Merger may not be satisfied, as noted above. If the Merger is not consummated, we would remain responsible for significant transaction costs, and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential strategic opportunities, in each case without realizing any benefits of the Merger. For these and other reasons, not consummating the Merger could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if the pending Offer and subsequent Merger are not consummated, the price of our common stock may decline significantly from the current market price, which we believe reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated. Additionally, a failure of the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community, and have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional financing\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 32\nin the future. Finally, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our business partners and employees or recruiting and retention efforts, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the operation of our business prior to closing, which could adversely affect our business.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, including by delaying or preventing the Company from pursuing non-ordinary course opportunities that may arise or precluding actions that may be advisable if the Company were to remain an independent public company.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to Parent. These costs could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for other uses.\nIf the Merger is not completed, in certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of $59.0 million to Parent. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the termination fee we may be required to pay, if any, under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes or other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur success depends substantially on Fintepla as commercial product and as a product candidate in other indications as well as our product candidate MT-1621. We cannot be certain that Fintepla will receive additional regulatory approvals we may pursue, or be successfully commercialized, or whether MT-1621 or any future product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nOur business depends substantially on the successful commercialization of Fintepla, and the development and commercialization of Fintepla for additional indications or other changes and of MT-1621. Although Fintepla has been approved in the United States and the EU for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older, we may not be able to obtain supplemental approvals for Fintepla or obtain initial approvals for MT-1621 in the future. Accordingly, Fintepla, MT-1621 and any future product candidates will require additional clinical and pre-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenues from product sales. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing, distribution and promotion of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, whose regulations differ from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA or NDA supplement from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the regulatory authorities of such countries, and we may never receive such regulatory approvals.\nFor example, MT-1621 has been evaluated in a Phase 2 retrospective treatment clinical study called RETRO, which demonstrated increased survival probability and improved functional abilities for patients treated with MT-1621 compared with untreated natural history control patients. However, the FDA or European Medicines Agency (EMA) may disagree with the design of the RETRO and the reliance on a natural history dataset as the comparator, and we may be required to conduct additional trials prior to seeking regulatory approval.\nObtaining regulatory approval for a product candidate is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and may not be successful. Any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for MT-1621 or any future product candidate, and any supplemental approvals for Fintepla, or failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable, would limit our ability to generate future revenues, would potentially harm the development prospects of Fintepla and MT-1621 and would have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nEven if we successfully obtain additional regulatory approvals to market Fintepla, or initial approvals to market MT-1621, our revenues will be dependent, in part, on our ability to commercialize such products as well as the size\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 33\nof the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets for our product candidates are not as significant as we estimate, our business and prospects will be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in executing our sales and marketing strategy for the commercialization of Fintepla.\nWe have built a highly specialized and focused commercial sales and marketing organization, including sales, marketing and customer support functions, to commercialize Fintepla in the United States and Germany, our first market in Europe. We will need to build a commercial sales and marketing organization to launch and commercialize Fintepla in other markets if we are able to secure appropriate marketing and reimbursement approvals. Prior to commercial launch of Fintepla, we had no prior experience in the marketing and sale of a rare disease product, and there are significant risks involved in managing a sales organization, including our ability to retain and incentivize qualified individuals, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, generate sufficient sales leads, effectively manage a sales and marketing team, and handle any unforeseen costs and expenses. In addition, even if our self-commercialization strategy works in one market, such strategy may not be successful in other markets. If we are unable to successfully maintain our sales and marketing organization, implement our commercialization plans and facilitate adoption by patients and physicians of Fintepla, then we will not be able to generate significant revenue which will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe depend on a sole specialty distributor, our customer, for distribution of Fintepla in the United States, and the failure of this specialty distributor to distribute Fintepla effectively would adversely affect sales of Fintepla.\nWe rely on our only customer, a specialty distributor for the distribution of Fintepla in the United States. Our customer subsequently resells our product through its related specialty pharmacy provider to patients and health care providers. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing, and a specialty distributor is a distributor that specializes in the distribution, of medications for complex or chronic conditions, which often require a high level of patient education, physician administration and ongoing management. The use of a specialty distributor who distributes Fintepla through its related specialty pharmacy provider to patients and health care providers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that our customer will:\n\u2022not provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our product or complaints about our product;\n\u2022reduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support our product;\n\u2022not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022engage in unlawful or inappropriate business practices that result in legal or regulatory enforcement activity which could result in liability to us or damage the goodwill within the Dravet syndrome community associated with Fintepla; and\n\u2022be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others.\nIn the event that our customer does not fulfill its contractual obligations to us or refuses to or fails to adequately perform distribution of Fintepla to patients and healthcare providers, or the agreements with us are terminated without adequate notice, shipments of Fintepla, and associated revenues, would be adversely affected.\nFurther, if our customer becomes subject to bankruptcy, is unable to pay us for our products or is acquired by a company that wants to terminate the relationship with us, or if we otherwise lose our relationship with our customer, our revenue, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. If our customer cannot perform as agreed or the relationship is otherwise terminated, we may be unable to replace them on a timely basis or at all. Even if we are able to replace our customer with a different specialty distributor/customer, such transition could result adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic has presented substantial public health and economic challenges and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. and global economy and financial markets. International and U.S. governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34\nactions to slow the spread of COVID-19, including issuing varying forms of \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, and restricting business functions outside of one\u2019s home. In response, we closed our offices for all but the most essential activities and have implemented a policy allowing all employees to work from across all locations, following the guidelines or directives issued by federal, state and local government agencies in the U.S. as well as the U.K. government. As a result of these restrictions, our sales force has not been able to conduct in-person interactions with physicians and healthcare providers and have been restricted to primarily conducting educational and promotional activities for Fintepla virtually, which may impact our ability to market Fintepla. To date, we have been able to continue to supply Fintepla commercially to our patients in the U.S. and Germany and both Fintepla and MT-1621 to our patients currently enrolled in our clinical trials and we do not currently anticipate any interruptions in clinical or commercial supply. In addition, while we are continuing the clinical trials we have underway in sites across the globe, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread around the globe, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, clinical trials and manufacturing and supply chains, including:\n\u2022an inability to effectively market Fintepla or interruptions in patient site access as part of our REMS program;\n\u2022further delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u2022interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems, including interruption of commercial supply;\n\u2022delays or inability of us or our independent registered public accounting firm to count and/or observe the counts of our physical inventories;\n\u2022delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials and interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022delays in receiving feedback or approvals from the FDA or other regulatory authorities with respect to future clinical trials or regulatory submissions, including for MT-1621;\n\u2022changes in local regulations as part of a response to COVID-19 which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue such clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022refusal of the FDA or EMA to accept data from clinical trials in certain geographies; and\n\u2022difficulties launching or commercializing products, including due to reduced access to doctors as a result of social distancing protocols.\nIn addition, the spread of COVID-19 has had and may continue to severely impact the trading price of shares of our common stock and could further severely impact our ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis or at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the COVID-19 may impact our business, including our commercial sales, clinical trials, manufacturing and supply chains and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35\ngeographic spread of certain variants of the disease that may be less susceptible to available vaccines, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section may be heightened.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety and efficacy for our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Before obtaining U.S. regulatory approval for a product candidate we must gather substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that the product candidate in question is safe and effective, and similar regulatory approvals would be necessary to commercialize our product candidates in other countries. Failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials.\nA number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. If our product candidates are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, the programs could be delayed or terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of our current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nThe results from the prior clinical trials of our product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results of future clinical trials or preclinical studies. The results of prior clinical trials of our product candidates may not be replicated in any future clinical trials of these product candidates. Clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in prior clinical trials nonetheless have failed to obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval. If we fail to produce positive results in our clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates and our business and financial prospects, would be adversely affected.\nFurther, Fintepla may not be approved for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS even though recent, positive topline results from our ongoing Phase 3 trial of Fintepla for LGS showed that Fintepla met its primary and certain key secondary endpoints. Similarly, MT1621 may not be approved even though the RETRO data demonstrated improved survival probability of patients treated with MT1621 compared with a natural history patient control group. The FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including with the design of the Phase 2 retrospective study comparing the outcomes from the MT-1621 active treatment group against outcomes from a natural history dataset. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change its requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that, if successful, would potentially form the basis for an application for approval by the FDA or another regulatory authority. Furthermore, any of these regulatory authorities may also approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our clinical studies, which are based on preliminary analyses of then-available data. Such preliminary results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following more comprehensive reviews of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 36\nverification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical studies. Interim data from this clinical trial and future clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues, following more comprehensive reviews of the data, and as more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials of its product candidates, or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular product candidate, the approvability or prospects for commercialization of the product candidate, or our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and stockholders and others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. Information that we decide not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate or our business. If the interim, topline or preliminary data that we disclose differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions we reach based on our analyses of such data, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for Fintepla or MT-1621 or pre-clinical or clinical testing for any future product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to pursue regulatory approvals for, or generate revenues from, such product candidates.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for Fintepla or MT-1621 or pre-clinical or clinical testing for any future product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan.\nThe completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022reaching agreement on acceptable terms with clinical research organization (CROs), clinical investigators and trial sites;\n\u2022manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate and placebo for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to initiate and conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022identifying, recruiting and enrolling subjects to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical trial programs for the treatment of similar indications;\n\u2022retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, personal issues, or for any other reason they choose, or who are lost to further follow-up;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding proper dosing; and\n\u2022scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions.\nIn addition, if a significant number of patients fail to stay enrolled in any of our current or future clinical trials of Fintepla or MT-1621 and such failure is not adequately accounted for in our trial design and enrollment assumptions, our clinical development program could be delayed.\nClinical trials may also be delayed or repeated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or unforeseen complications in testing. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022inability to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 37\n\u2022inability by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with all applicable FDA, DEA or other regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other unforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;\n\u2022lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials;\n\u2022slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n\u2022inability of our CROs or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022unfavorable results from on-going clinical trials and pre-clinical studies.\nAdditionally, changes in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities and IRBs or ethics committees for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for Fintepla, MT-1621 and any future product candidates may be harmed, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, additional government regulation with respect to clinical trials may be enacted. For instance, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU recently evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (CTA) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state\u2019s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.\nIt is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU. The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). On January 17, 2022, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the UK legislation for clinical trials. The consultation closes on 14 March 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation will be closely watched and will determine whether the UK chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A decision by the UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that will be adopted in the EU may have an effect on the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization in the EU for our product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies governing clinical trials, our development plans may be impacted.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 38\nWe face intense competition, and if our competitors market and/or develop treatments for any of our product candidates\u2019 indications that are marketed more effectively, approved more quickly than our product candidates or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well-established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in marketing products and obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than we do.\nFor example, Fintepla competes against other products and product candidates approved and in development for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In June 2018, the FDA approved the first treatment for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, as well as LGS, GW Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Epidiolex\u00ae (cannabidiol or CBD). Epidiolex is a liquid drug formulation of plant-derived purified CBD, which is a chemical component of the Cannabis sativa plant, more commonly known as marijuana. GW\u2019s CBD was subsequently approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and LGS by the European Commission (as Epidyolex\u00ae) in September of 2019. In August 2018, the FDA approved a second treatment, Biocodex\u2019s Diacomit\u00ae (stiripentol), for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients who are also taking clobazam. Stiripentol is approved in Europe, Canada and Japan for the treatment of Dravet syndrome when used in conjunction with valproate and/or clobazam. Multiple companies are developing clinical-staged product candidates for the potential treatment of Dravet syndrome. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited is currently evaluating its product candidate TAK-935/OV935, a first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), for the potential treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome and LGS in Phase 2 clinical trials. Additional clinical stage candidates for the treatment of Dravet syndrome include LP352 from Longboard Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Phase 1), Huperzine-A from Supernus Pharmaceuticals (Phase 1/2), and clemizole (Phase 1) being evaluated by Epygenix Therapeutics, Inc.\nWe expect Fintepla to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. While we currently are not aware of any pharmaceutical companies who are developing a pharmaceutical product candidate for the treatment of TK2d that would compete against MT-1621, one or more of our competitors may develop other products that compete with ours, obtain necessary approvals for such products from the FDA, or other agencies, if required, more rapidly than we do or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than any products developed by us. The competition that we will encounter with respect to any of our product candidates that receive the requisite regulatory approval and classification and are marketed will have an effect on our product prices, market share and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully differentiate any products that we are able to market from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better results than those of our competitors or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. In addition, competitors may seek to develop alternative formulations of our product candidates and/or alternative drug delivery technologies that address our targeted indications.\nThe commercial opportunity for our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations and/or drug delivery technologies outside the scope of our products. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022capital resources;\n\u2022research and development resources, expertise and experience, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022drug development, clinical trial and regulatory resources and experience;\n\u2022sales and marketing resources and experience;\n\u2022manufacturing and distribution resources and experience;\n\u2022name recognition; and\n\u2022resources, experience and expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit or block us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed or accepted or less costly than ours and may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively with the marketed therapeutics of our competitors or if such competitors are successful in developing products that effectively compete with any of our product candidates that are approved, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nIf Fintepla or MT-1621, if approved, does not achieve broad market acceptance or coverage by third-party payors, the revenues that we generate will be limited.\nThe commercial success of Fintepla in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome or, if approved, in other indications, or of MT1621, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Adequate coverage and reimbursement of our approved product by third-party payors are critical for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of Fintepla or any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022acceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022any negative publicity or political action related to our or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022the relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022demonstration to authorities of the pharmacoeconomic benefits;\n\u2022demonstration to authorities of the improvement in burden of illness;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved or EMA-approved labeling;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which a product is approved;\n\u2022availability and perceived advantages of alternative treatments;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our or any current or future collaborators\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution strategies;\n\u2022pricing and cost effectiveness;\n\u2022our ability to obtain sufficient U.S. third-party payor coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022our ability to obtain European countries\u2019 pricing authorities\u2019 coverage and reimbursement; and\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of third-party payor coverage.\nOur efforts to educate the medical community, U.S. third-party payors and European countries\u2019 health authorities on the benefits of Fintepla or any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities and gain broad market acceptance may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors, pharmacists, patients, and the medical community, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products to become or remain profitable.\nBreakthrough therapy designation and access to the PRIME scheme for MT-1621 may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that MT1621 or any of our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIn February 2019, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for MT1621 in the United States for the treatment of TK2d. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Designation as a\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 40\nbreakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. We cannot be sure that any evaluation we may make of our product candidates as qualifying for breakthrough therapy designation will meet the FDA\u2019s expectations. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even though MT1621 qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that MT-1621, or any of our other product candidates that may qualify as a breakthrough therapy, no longer meets the conditions for qualification, or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. For example, the FDA rescinded breakthrough therapy designation for Fintepla for Dravet syndrome due to the existence of two recently approved therapies for Dravet syndrome and, therefore, the administrative criteria for designation were no longer met.\nIn November 2018, the EMA admitted MT-1621 to the PRIME scheme for the treatment of patients with TK2d. In the EU, innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the Breakthrough Therapy designation in the United States. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA\u2019s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a rapporteur before submission of a marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.\nEven though we have access to PRIME for MT-1621, this may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional EMA procedures. The EMA may later decide that MT-1621 no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for review or approval will not be shortened. Further, obtaining access to PRIME does not assure or increase the likelihood of grant of a marketing authorization by the European Commission.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that certain of our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for those product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nWe have sought and may seek FDA approval in the future through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from trials that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FDCA, would allow an NDA we submit to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as we anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval.\nEven if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 41\n505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to accelerated product development or earlier approval.\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nWe have a history of significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations. We cannot predict if or when we will become profitable and anticipate that our net losses and negative cash flow from operations will continue for at least the next year.\nWe were organized in 2006, began commercialization of Sumavel DosePro in January 2010 and launched the commercial sale of Zohydro ER in the United States in March 2014. We sold our Sumavel DosePro business in April 2014 and sold our Zohydro ER business in April 2015. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by pharmaceutical companies developing and commercializing new products.\nExcluding gains from two discrete business divestitures, we have incurred significant net losses from our operations since the inception and have an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $185.3 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for at least the next year primarily as a result of costs incurred related to the development and commercialization of Fintepla and MT-1621. Additionally, in the event that MT-1621 is approved in the United States or the EU, we will owe milestone payments related to our acquisition of development and commercialization rights to MT-1621. Our ability to generate revenues from Fintepla or MT-1621, if approved, will depend on a number of factors including our ability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals in target countries and negotiate arrangements with third parties to help finance the development of, and market and distribute, any product candidates that receive regulatory approval. In addition, we are subject to the risk that the marketplace will not accept our products.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization and product development efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when or if we will become profitable, if at all. If we do not generate significant sales from Fintepla or MT-1621, if approved, or any future product candidate that may receive regulatory approval, there would likely be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects which could result in our inability to continue operations.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have agreements with third-party CROs to conduct our ongoing and planned Phase 3 programs for Fintepla and our clinical development program of MT-1621. We rely heavily on these parties for the execution of our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and regulatory requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with GCP requirements for clinical studies of our product candidates, and GLP requirements for certain pre-clinical studies. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA and similar foreign regulators will determine that any of our clinical trials comply or complied with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP, regulations, and require a large number of test subjects. Our inability to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42\nregulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate additional revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. For example, in September 2019, we completed the acquisition of Modis, which owns worldwide development and commercialization rights to MT-1621. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022significant or higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022increased amortization expenses;\n\u2022difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management, personnel and ownership; and\n\u2022inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any additional transactions of the nature described above, any additional transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are dependent on numerous third parties in our manufacturing supply chain, all of which are currently single source suppliers, for the clinical supply of Fintepla, and if we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the development of Fintepla could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We outsource all manufacturing and packaging of the clinical trial materials for Fintepla and MT-1621 to third parties and will rely on third parties for commercial manufacturing and packaging of Fintepla, and for MT-1621, if approved. In February 2019, we entered into a master supply agreement with Aptuit, pursuant to which Aptuit became our commercial manufacturer and supplier of the fenfluramine API. In addition, in July 2019 we entered into the PCI Pharma Agreement, pursuant to which PCI Pharma became our commercial manufacturer and supplier for Fintepla. We may never be able to establish additional sources of supply for Fintepla.\nThe facilities used by third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit a an NDA to the\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 43\nFDA or their equivalent to other regulatory agencies. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, third-party manufacturers for compliance with cGMP or similar foreign requirements for manufacture of our drug products. If these third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, including requirements related to the manufacturing of high potency and pure compounds or other products, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates, or if regulatory authorities withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market Fintepla or our other product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. Our or a third-party\u2019s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements, to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with cGMP or similar foreign requirements could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including an inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of any future product candidates under development, delays in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving marketing approvals, for our product candidates, requirements to cease development or to recall batches of our product candidates, and an inability to meet commercial demands for Fintepla or our other products, if approved. In addition, reliance on suppliers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidate ourselves, including:\n\u2022reliance on the third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control or the insolvency of any of these third parties or other financial difficulties, labor unrest, natural disasters or other factors adversely affecting their ability to conduct their business; and\n\u2022the possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreements by the third parties, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.\nIf our contract manufacturers or suppliers are unable to provide the quantities of our product candidate required for our clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial sale, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers or suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and would have to delay or terminate our pre-clinical or clinical trials, and we would lose potential revenue. It may also take a significant period of time to establish an alternative source of supply for our products, product candidates and components and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any of the above factors could cause the delay or suspension of initiation or completion of clinical trials, regulatory submissions or required approvals of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or develop our product candidates or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and key clinical development, regulatory, sales and marketing and other personnel. As of December 31, 2021, we had 327 full-time employees, consisting of 250 employed in the United States, 73 employed in the United Kingdom and other European countries and four in Japan. Of these employees, 154 were engaged primarily in product development, quality assurance and clinical development and regulatory activities, 89 were engaged primarily in sales and commercialization activities, nine were engaged primarily in manufacturing, and the remaining 75 were engaged primarily in management and general and administrative activities. If we are not able to retain our employee base, we may not be able to effectively manage our business or be successful in commercializing our products.\nWe are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercial and financial expertise of our senior management team. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 44\nand other businesses, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have our headquarters. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives, our ability to raise additional capital, our ability to implement our business strategy and our ability to maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team, especially our Chief Executive Officer and President, Stephen J. Farr, Ph.D., could delay or prevent the continued development and commercialization of Fintepla and our other product candidates. Further, if we lose any members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nAlthough we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements are terminable by them at will at any time with or without notice and, therefore, do not provide any assurance that we will be able to retain their services. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of our senior management team or the lives of any of our other employees. In addition, we have clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the value of the Euro or UK pound sterling could negatively impact our results of operations and increase our costs.\nWe conduct research and development activities in the UK and other European countries and some of the payments for these activities are denominated in Euros and UK pounds sterling. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and our results of operations may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro or UK pound sterling, such as the decline in value of the UK pound sterling following the results of the UK\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the EU. A significant appreciation in the Euro or UK pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar will result in higher expenses and cause increases in our net losses. Likewise, to the extent that we generate any revenues denominated in foreign currencies, or become required to make payments in other foreign currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and those foreign currencies could also negatively impact our results of operations. We currently have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts to reduce the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and foreign currency hedging is inherently risky and may result in unanticipated losses.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for Fintepla or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval on reasonable pricing terms, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nSuccessful sales of Fintepla and any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nIn addition, the market for our products will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.\nIn addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using competitive bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 45\ndrug and other healthcare programs. This can reduce demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nThe commercial use of our products and clinical use of our products and product candidates expose us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk exists even if a product or product candidate is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities regulated by the FDA such as the case with Zohydro ER, or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products and product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with Zohydro ER or our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. For example, Zohydro ER is an opioid pain reliever that contains hydrocodone, which is a regulated \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) and could result in harm to patients relating to its potential for abuse. Although we no longer sell Zohydro ER following the sale of the Zohydro ER business in April 2015, we retain all liabilities associated with the Zohydro ER business arising prior to such sale, including possible product liability exposure in connection with sales of Zohydro ER made prior to the sale of the Zohydro ER business. In addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our products or product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury.\nProduct liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or product candidates, if approved, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022the inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022product recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022costs of related litigation;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022loss of revenues.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for commercial product sales and clinical trials with a $20 million per occurrence and annual aggregate coverage limit. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage based on approval of Fintepla, or otherwise, we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects, including side effects that are less severe than those of Zohydro ER and our product candidates. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 46\ncause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize MT-1621 or any future product candidates outside of the United States.\nWe market Fintepla and if approved, we intend to market MT-1621 outside of the United States. In order to market our products outside of the United States, we, or any potential partner, must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our products. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks.\nIn the EU, we have taken advantage of the hybrid application pathway of the EU centralized procedure, which is similar to the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) pathway. Hybrid applications may rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials contained in the authorization dossier of the reference product, but must be supplemented with additional data. In territories where data is not freely available, we or our partners may not have the ability to commercialize our products without negotiating rights from third parties to refer to their clinical data in our regulatory applications, which could require the expenditure of significant additional funds. We, or any potential partner, may be unable to obtain rights to the necessary clinical data and may be required to develop our own proprietary safety effectiveness dossiers. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nInability to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved at all or for all requested indications, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on their commercial potential or require costly, post-marketing studies. In addition, we, or any potential partner, may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution if we are unable to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our research and development efforts and business operations, injury to our employees and others, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nThe UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU legislation continued to apply in the UK during a transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to global trade deals negotiated by the EU\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 47\non behalf of its members and provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which became effective on the January 1, 2021.\nThe long term effects of UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on our business in the UK, the EU and worldwide will depend on the effects of the implementation and application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any other relevant agreements between the UK and the EU. EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as \u201cretained EU law\u201d. However, new legislation will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an \u2018appropriate authority\u2019 to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps. There is a possibility that over time, national laws will be amended and that consequently the regulatory framework in Great Britain will diverge from that of the EU. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK\u2019s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain; broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. In addition, a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK is derived from EU directives and regulations. The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of product candidates, disrupt the importation and export of active substances and other components of drug formulations, and disrupt the supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the UK and/or the EU. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and are dependent upon external sources of financing to fund our business and development.\nWe currently have limited collaboration revenue under an arrangement with Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. We commenced the commercial launch of Fintepla in the United States in July 2020 and in Germany in February 2021, which have produced limited revenue to date. We have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and debt, and have incurred negative cash flow from operations in each year since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $227.4 million, $209.4 million and $419.5 million, respectively, and our cash used in operating activities was $185.3 million, $167.5 million and $111.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion. The net losses and negative cash flow from operations have had a material adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for at least the next year to conduct clinical trials to support regulatory approval of our product candidates. As a result, we will remain dependent upon external sources of financing to fund our business and the development and commercialization of any approved products and product candidates. To the extent we need to raise additional capital in the future, we cannot ensure that debt or equity financing will be available to us in amounts, at times or on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. Any shortfall in our cash resources could require that we delay or abandon certain development and commercialization activities and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may require additional funding in the future to carry out our plan of operations and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We will require additional capital in the future to fund our operations, including:\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48\n\u2022further development of our product candidates to support potential regulatory approval; and\n\u2022commercialize any of our product candidates, or any products or product candidates that we may develop, in-license or otherwise acquire, if any such product candidates receive regulatory approval.\nIn addition, our estimates of the amount of cash necessary to fund our business and development activities may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development programs for our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u2022the timing of regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and the commercial success of Fintepla and any other approved products;\n\u2022the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022the costs of establishing or outsourcing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, should we elect to do so;\n\u2022the costs, terms and timing of completion of outsourced commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for any product candidate;\n\u2022the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022the terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and cash flow from operations and achieve profitability, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, receivables financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional funds when needed, we may be required to significantly delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts, or cease operating as a going concern. We also may be required to relinquish, license or otherwise dispose of rights to product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, including by raising additional funds when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes.\nIn September 2020, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes in a private offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with the offering, we granted the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $30.0 million in principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, which was exercised in full in October 2020. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which reduces the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n\u2022diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes; and\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the Convertible Senior Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nOur results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn.\nOur results of operations and liquidity could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, public health emergencies, the availability and cost of credit, and the U.S. financial markets have in the past contributed to, and may continue in the future to contribute to, increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy, including limiting global travel, impacting our operations and the operations of the third-parties we work with. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the progress on the distribution of vaccinations in the locations where we operate, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of any variants of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. In addition, domestic and international equity and debt markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns. In the event these economic conditions and concerns continue or worsen and the markets continue to remain volatile, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are not federally insured. If economic instability continues, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, receivables or royalty financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. For example, in May 2016, we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement (the ATM Sales Agreement), with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (Cantor), pursuant to which Cantor agreed to act as a sales agent in connection with sale of our common stock from time to time pursuant to an effective registration statement. In June 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement (the 2020 ATM Prospectus), to our automatic \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement on Form S-3 registering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $200.0 million in gross aggregate proceeds of common stock pursuant to the 2016 Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there was $194.9 million remaining for future sales under the 2020 ATM Prospectus. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, your ownership interest in us will be diluted. Debt financing typically contains covenants that restrict operating activities.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our current product or product candidates or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we may be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate the commercialization and development of our product or product candidates.\nWe may be unable to benefit from favorable U.K. tax legislation.\nAs a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the U.K.\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) R&D tax relief scheme. For each discrete tax year, we have an option to receive an enhanced U.K. tax deduction on our eligible R&D activities or, when we are in a net operating loss position for that year, we can elect to surrender net operating losses that arose from our eligible R&D activities in\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50\nexchange for a cash payment from the U.K. tax authorities for amounts up to 33.35% of qualifying expenditures. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables and certain internal overhead costs incurred as part of research projects. The majority of our R&D activities consist of qualifying expenditures under the U.K.\u2019s SME R&D tax relief scheme. To date, aggregate cash payments received under this tax relief scheme were approximately $10.1 million. We may not be able to continue to benefit from the U.K.\u2019s SME R&D tax relief scheme in the future as we increase our personnel and expand our business because we may no longer qualify as an SME. In order to qualify as an SME for R&D tax credits, we must continue to be a company with fewer than 500 employees and also have either an annual turnover not exceeding \u20ac100 million or a balance sheet not exceeding \u20ac86 million. We may also benefit in the future from U.K.\u2019s R&D Expenditure Credit scheme, or the RDEC scheme, available to larger companies. However, the RDEC scheme has a significantly lower credit than the SME scheme. In addition, changes in U.K. tax legislation may reduce or limit any future claims. For example, a policy paper was published on October 29, 2018 setting out HMRC\u2019s intention from April 2020 to cap the amount of cash rebate that a qualifying loss-making business can receive in any one year under the research and development tax credit regime for SMEs at three times the company\u2019s total liability for National Insurance contributions and income tax under the Pay As You Earn system.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss and research and development income tax credit carryforwards may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development income tax credit carryforwards, and certain other attributes (such as any future carryovers resulting from disallowed business interest deductions) (collectively, tax attributes) that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income, if any. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a rolling three-year period as determined under the Code, which we refer to as an ownership change. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of these tax attributes before they expire. Although we have experienced several ownership changes in the past, we do not anticipate that the limitations arising from prior ownership changes will significantly impact our ability to utilize our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We may also experience ownership changes in the future, however, which could limit the use of our tax attributes and have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, we may not use net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to reduce our taxable income by more than 80% in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020. These limitations may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes in prior years.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $301.7 million. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities include money market funds and certificate of deposits, securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities and commercial paper meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which prioritizes the preservation of capital. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, instability in the global financial markets, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our investments could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the availability of cash to fund our operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nFintepla is approved in the United States, the EU and the UK for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years and older, and we currently are developing Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS and CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), and are developing MT-1621 for the treatment of TK2d. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing, distribution and promotion of drug products, among other things, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in and outside the United States. We are not permitted to market Fintepla or any of our product candidates in the United States unless and until we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or similar approval from foreign regulatory authorities. We cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, or that any such product candidates will be successfully commercialized.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 51\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. For example:\n\u2022the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval;\n\u2022the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may not approve of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 processes and facilities; or\n\u2022the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations. For instance, the EU pharmaceutical legislation is currently undergoing a complete review process, in the context of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe initiative, launched by the European Commission in November 2020. A proposal for revision of several legislative instruments related to medicinal products (potentially revising the duration of regulatory exclusivity, eligibility for expedited pathways, etc.) is expected to be adopted by the European Commission by the end of 2022. The proposed revisions, once they are agreed and adopted by the European Parliament and European Council (not expected before the end of 2024) may have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the long term.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approval. We cannot guarantee that the FDA foreign regulatory authorities will interpret trial results as we do, and more trials could be required before we are able to submit applications seeking approval of our product candidates. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. This lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failing to obtain additional regulatory approvals to market Fintepla, or our failure to obtain initial regulatory approvals to market MT1621 or any other product candidate, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate with a REMS or a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate or other risk management measures. For example, the FDA approved Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome subject to the Fintepla REMS program, which requires echocardiogram assessments of patients before, during, and after treatment with Fintepla. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may also grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to maintain orphan drug designation or obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for Fintepla or MT-1621.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designation for Fintepla in the United States and the European Union for both the treatment of Dravet syndrome and LGS. We have also received orphan drug designation for MT1621 for the treatment of TK2d. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 people, there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the disease or condition can be recovered by sales in the United States. In the EU, orphan drug designation is granted by the European Commission based on a scientific opinion of the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if its sponsor can establish that (i) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the medicinal product\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 52\nwill be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation in the United States confers certain benefits, including tax incentives and waiver of the applicable application fee upon submission of the product for approval in the rare disease or condition. In the EU, sponsors who obtain orphan designation benefit from a number of incentives, including protocol assistance, access to the centralized procedure and fee reductions.\nIf a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is eligible for a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities from approving another marketing application for the same drug to treat the same rare disease or condition for that time period, except in limited circumstances. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the EU. Also, we are only able to attain orphan drug designation in the EU if we are able to demonstrate to the competent authorities that our product candidates have incremental benefit over any other approved product for that orphan disorder.\nThe European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at this end of the fifth year, a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities determine that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nOrphan drug exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition in the United States or the EU because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted exclusivity, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities can subsequently approve the same or a similar drug for the same condition during the exclusivity period if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities conclude that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nUse of our product candidates could be associated with side effects, adverse events or other properties or safety risks, which could delay or preclude approval, cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon a product candidate, limit the commercial profile of the label for an approved product candidate, or result in other significant negative consequences that could severely harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nResults of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence, or unexpected characteristics of side effects. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, result in a more restrictive label for the product candidate, or delay or cause the denial of regulatory approval of the product candidate by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The drug-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment for our clinical trials, or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trials, or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nMoreover, if our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may elect to abandon their development or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, which may limit the commercial prospects for the product candidate if approved. We may also be required to modify our plans for future studies based on findings in our ongoing clinical trials. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. In addition, regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions or require additional testing to confirm these determinations.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by Fintepla, or by MT1621 or any of our future product candidates, if approved, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may not approve, or may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may add new limitations for distribution and marketing of the product;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings in the product label or narrowing of the indication in the product label;\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 53\n\u2022we may be required to implement a REMS or create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients or other risk management measures;\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way;\n\u2022we may be required to implement a REMS program or similar risk management measures;\n\u2022the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of the above events resulting from undesirable side effects or other previously unknown problems could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product, if approved, and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nEven though we have obtained regulatory approval for Fintepla, and even if we obtain approval for MT-1621 or any other product candidate, we will remain subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions on marketing or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nFollowing potential approval of any of our product candidates, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may also require a REMS or similar risk management measure as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. For example, the FDA approved Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome subject to the Fintepla REMS program, which among other things, requires echocardiogram assessments of patients before, during, and after treatment with Fintepla. Fintepla is also subject to a similar monitoring in the EU. In addition, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements following approval. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs or similar foreign requirements and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including adverse events of unanticipated type, severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022restrictions on product distribution or use, or requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022fines, restitutions, disgorgement of profits or revenues, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications we filed or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54\nIn addition, the product labeling, advertising and promotion for Fintepla, and for any of our product candidates that may receive approval, will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA or and foreign regulatory authorities strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. For example, the FDA-approved label for Fintepla is limited to the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. Physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s or foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies, such as the EMA following its relocation to Amsterdam and resulting staff changes, may also slow the time necessary for new drugs or modifications to approved drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities, and on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, in July 2020, the FDA resumed certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA utilized this risk-based assessment system to assist in determining when and where it was safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. Additionally, on April 15, 2021, the FDA issued a guidance document in which the FDA described its plans to conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations of certain drug manufacturing facilities and clinical research sites, among other facilities. According to the guidance, the FDA may request such remote interactive evaluations where the FDA determines that remote evaluation would be appropriate based on mission needs and travel limitations. In May 2021, the FDA outlined a detailed plan to move toward a more consistent state of inspectional operations, and in July 2021, the FDA resumed standard inspectional operations of domestic facilities and was continuing to maintain this level of operation as of September 2021. More recently, the FDA has continued to monitor and implement changes to its inspectional activities to ensure the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates as it adapts to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Regulatory authorities outside the United States have adopted similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 55\nThe successful commercialization of Fintepla and our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which third-party payors, including governmental authorities and private health insurers, provide funding, establish favorable coverage and pricing policies, and set adequate reimbursement levels. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for Fintepla or any of our product candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nOur ability to commercialize Fintepla and any of our product candidates successfully, particularly in orphan or rare disease indications, will depend in part on the availability of favorable coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement for the product and alternative treatments from third-party payors (e.g., governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations). Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is contingent on our ability to:\n\u2022obtain clinical data that supports payor value/benefit assessments;\n\u2022execute formal payor value/benefit assessment processes;\n\u2022obtain coverage that enables use in populations reflected in any product candidate\u2019s approved product label; and\n\u2022effectively negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement terms.\nWhile in some markets, there is a single payor, in other markets there are multiple payors that can have different ways of assessing prescription drugs. To commercialize our product candidates successfully, we will be required to have sufficient expertise and resources to execute on the respective product candidate\u2019s coverage and reimbursement strategy, which we cannot be certain we will be able to do.\nGovernmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by delaying the time to reimbursement, and by restricting the breadth of patient-coverage and limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular products in terms of lower pricing and increasing the proportion of the cost for which the patient is responsible. There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved products or product indications, coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, and reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Coverage and reimbursement barriers by payors may materially impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or available only at limited levels, or if such coverage will require patient out-of-pocket costs that are unacceptably high, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Moreover, any coverage or reimbursement that may be obtained may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nThird-party payors continue to introduce new tactics to contain costs, including more rigorous value/benefit assessment processes and criteria. It is possible that third-party payors will change the clinical comparators that serve as benchmarks for determining relative value. The result of such a change would be a more challenging value/benefit assessment caused by a more challenging basis for comparison and the potential for a worse relative outcome. Third-party payors may determine that we have failed to generate sufficient evidence to support a value/benefit assessment and refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement, thereby impacting or preventing the progression to a price negotiation. The potential of third-party payors to introduce more rigorous value/benefit assessment processes and criteria could have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully.\nThird-party payors are also introducing more challenging price negotiation tactics, including in re-visiting established coverage and reimbursement in cases when new competitors, including brands, generics and biosimilars enter the market. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our product candidates as substitutable and only offer to cover the cost of the alternative product. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with Fintepla or any our product candidates, if approved, pricing of competitive products may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our product candidates. Third-party payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our products. In some cases, when new competitor generic and biosimilar products enter the market, there are mandatory price reductions for the innovator compound, in other cases, payors employ \u201ctherapeutic category\u201d price referencing and seek to lower the reimbursement levels for all treatment in the respective therapeutic category. In other cases, new competitor brand drugs can trigger therapeutic category reviews in the interest of modifying coverage and or\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 56\nreimbursement levels. The potential of third-party payors to introduce more challenging price negotiation tactics could have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully.\nEvolving health policy and associated legislative changes aimed at lowering healthcare expenditure could impact the commercialization of Fintepla and our product candidates. Pharmaceutical pricing has been, and likely will continue to be, a central component of these efforts.\nThe regulations that govern regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products vary widely from country to country. In markets of some countries we may pursue outside of the United States for any of our product candidates, the products may be subject to extensive governmental price control or other price regulations. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product candidate in a particular country, but then be subject to price negotiations that delay our commercial launch of the product candidate, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product candidate in that country. Adverse pricing and reimbursement limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nNet prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or legislated rebates that must be paid in order to participate in government healthcare programs or paid to other third-party payors. Mandatory discounts can be legislated at any time in any market. Similarly, some markets currently have pricing legislation that sets the price of a pharmaceutical product in their market by referencing the price of that product in other markets, known as international reference pricing. International reference pricing has the potential to impact price cuts in individual countries and the countries that reference the pricing of certain other individual countries. Expansion of mandatory discounts and international reference pricing, including into the United States, presents a material risk to our ability to achieve favorable pricing and adequate reimbursement.\nDrug importation and cross-border trade, both sanctioned and unsanctioned, occurs when a pharmaceutical product from a market where the official price is set lower is shipped and made commercially available in a market where the official price is set higher. Any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict or limit drug importation or cross-border trade, including in the United States, could have a material negative impact on our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become intense. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain favorable pricing for our product candidates and adequate reimbursement.\nIf we fail to comply with reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in governmental programs that impose drug price reporting, payment, and other compliance obligations on pharmaceutical manufacturers. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (\u201cMDRP\u201d), as a condition of having federal funds available for a manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and under Medicare Part B, we must enter into, and have entered into, an agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay a rebate to state Medicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and paid for by the state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data that we are required to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare programs. For the MDRP, these data include the average manufacturer price (\u201cAMP\u201d) for each drug and, in the case of innovator products, the Best Price, which represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. If we become aware that our MDRP submissions for a prior period were incorrect or have changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 57\nare found to have knowingly submitted false information to CMS, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions, including termination from the MDRP.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d) and requires us to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for our covered drugs when used in an outpatient setting. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. A drug that is designated for a rare disease or condition by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not subject to the 340B ceiling price requirement with regard to the following covered entities: rural referral centers, sole community hospitals, critical access hospitals, and free-standing cancer hospitals. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA publishes them to 340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities for 340B-eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through which 340B covered entities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program, such as adding further covered entities or requiring participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs when used in an inpatient setting.\nIn order to be eligible to have drug products paid for with federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we must also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d) pricing program. Under the VA/FSS program, we must report the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (\u201cNon-FAMP\u201d) for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no more than the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula. These four agencies are the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service). We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If a manufacturer participating in the FSS program fails to provide timely information or is found to have knowingly submitted false information, the manufacturer may be subject to civil monetary penalties.\nIndividual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are considering implementation of drug price transparency legislation that may prevent or limit our ability to take price increases at certain rates or frequencies. Requirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states are authorized to impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers for the untimely, inaccurate, or incomplete reporting of drug pricing information or for otherwise failing to comply with drug price transparency requirements. If we are found to have violated state law requirements, we may become subject to penalties or other enforcement mechanisms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts, which can change and evolve over time. Such pricing calculations and reporting, along with any necessary restatements and recalculations, could increase costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the MDRP and other governmental programs, and under the MDRP could result in an overage or underage in Medicaid rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations under the MDRP also may affect the ceiling price at which manufacturers are required to offer products under the 340B program. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price or product information to the government, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. CMS could also terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS or other governmental agencies to be incomplete or incorrect.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 58\nHealthcare reform measures and changes in policies, funding, staffing and leadership at the FDA and other agencies could hinder or prevent the commercial success of Fintepla or any of our product candidates that may be approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the United States and internationally, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and the future results of operations of our customers. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal, state and foreign levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which included measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u2022an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022a modification of the Average Manufacturer Price definition under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer point-of-sale discounts of 70% off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u2022a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n\u2022establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through July 1, 2022 (with a 1% payment reduction from April 1 to June 30,\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 59\n2022), unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which eliminates the statutory cap on the Medicaid drug rebate, currently set at 100% of a drug\u2019s AMP, beginning January 1, 2024.\nRecently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the Build Back Better Act, if enacted, would introduce substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated \u201cmaximum fair price\u201d for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, and the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers under Medicare Parts B and D. If the Build Back Better Act is not enacted, similar or other drug pricing proposals could appear in future legislation. The likelihood of implementation of these and other reform initiatives is uncertain. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our products and product candidates.\nIndividual states have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws may result in additional reductions in governmental and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications have fluctuated over the last ten years, and we cannot predict the review time for any of our submissions with any regulatory authorities. In addition, review times can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.\nIn the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the United States and EU, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nIn December, 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. This regulation which entered into force in January 2022 intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The regulation foresees a three-year transitional period and will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 60\nresponsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.\nWe may incur liability if our continuing medical or health education programs and/or product promotions are determined, or are perceived, to be inconsistent with regulatory guidelines.\nThe FDA provides guidelines with respect to appropriate promotion and continuing medical and health education activities. Although we endeavor to follow these guidelines, the FDA or the Office of the Inspector General U.S. Department of Health and Human Services may disagree, and we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted and our reputation could be damaged. Similar risks exist in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf we do not comply with federal, state and foreign healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022HIPAA which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022federal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements that require drug manufacturers to report and disclose any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, and any investment or ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report data to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022federal price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our commercial products;\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; and\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 61\n\u2022similar healthcare laws and regulations in the EU and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased state regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, and require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws and impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance of one or more of the requirements.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, requirements and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data. Implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or perception of their requirements may have on our business. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.\nAs our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. While we do not believe that we are currently acting as a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and thus are not directly regulated under HIPAA, any person may be prosecuted under HIPAA\u2019s criminal provisions either directly or under aiding-and-abetting or conspiracy principles. Consequently, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered healthcare provider or research institution that has not satisfied HIPAA\u2019s requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health information.\nCertain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 62\nviolations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn the EU, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws; in July 2020, the CJEU limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of SCCs. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the UK; the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office launched a public consultation on its draft revised data transfers mechanisms in August 2021 and laid its proposal before Parliament, with the UK SCCs expected to come into force in March 2022, with a two-year grace period. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the SCCs cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nFurther, from January 1, 2021, we are subject to the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/extends that decision, and remains under review by the Commission during this period. In September 2021, the UK government launched a consultation on its proposals for wide-ranging reform of UK data protection laws following Brexit. There is a risk that any material changes which are made to the UK data protection regime could result in the Commission reviewing the UK adequacy decision, and the UK losing its adequacy decision if the Commission deems the UK to no longer provide adequate protection for personal data. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.\nAlthough we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with which we must comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or other third parties to comply with such requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 63\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and technology, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success depends in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product candidates, their respective components, formulations, methods used to manufacture them and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nWe in-licensed certain data from a continuing, long-term, open-label study in 15 Dravet syndrome patients, as well as certain intellectual property related to fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome from the Universities of Antwerp and Leuven in Belgium (the Universities).\nPrior to receiving rights to four U.S. patents in 2017, we did not own or control any issued patents covering Fintepla or its use. There is no guarantee that any of our pending applications will issue as patents. With respect to our MT-1621 product candidate, we have certain patent rights that we obtained through our acquisition of Modis. In September 2016, Modis entered into a license agreement (the Columbia Agreement), with Columbia, under which Modis was granted an exclusive worldwide license and sublicense to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Columbia to develop and commercialize MT-1621 and certain backup compounds for any application or purpose. These licensed patent rights include patents owned by Columbia and patents jointly owned by Columbia and Vall d\u2019Hebron Research Institute (VHIR). VHIR delegated to Columbia the rights to enter into the Columbia Agreement on VHIR\u2019s behalf. The patent family jointly owned by Columbia and VHIR is directed to the use of MT-1621 to treat TK2d and includes a granted U.S. patent and a granted European patent application, pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Russia, as well as continuing applications in the United States and Europe. There are no patents covering the API in MT-1621.\nThe initial applications covering MT1621 or the methods of treatment using Fintepla were licensed by us and not written by our attorneys. Neither we nor our licensors had control over the drafting and initial prosecution of these applications. Further, the counsel previously handling the Fintepla and MT-1621 matters might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution to these applications as we would have if we had been the owners and originators of the applications and had control over the drafting and prosecution. In addition, the former counsel handling these matters may not have been completely familiar with U.S. patent law or the patent law in various countries, possibly resulting in inadequate disclosure, improperly claiming inventions and/or filing of applications at times which do not meet appropriate priority requirements. The named inventors on the pending applications and others involved in the protection of the intellectual property related to Fintepla and MT-1621 did not and may still not have sufficient knowledge relating to preferred procedures and the legal requirements related to the protection of intellectual property. They published papers which adversely affected our licensed rights, particularly in jurisdictions without a grace period for inventors\u2019 own disclosures. Although they have been advised with respect to procedures going forward, we cannot directly control their actions. All of these factors and others could result in the inability to obtain the issuance of additional applications in the United States or elsewhere in the world. Even if additional patents issue, such issued patents may later be found invalid or unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts.\nIn 2021, we initiated three patent infringement actions on Orange Book-listed patents under The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (\u201cHatch-Waxman Act\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\u201cANDAs\u201d) for fenfluramine products referencing Fintepla. The defendants, Lupin Ltd., Apotex Inc., and Apotex Corp., have raised common defenses and counterclaims of noninfringement and/or invalidity. Depending on the outcome of these actions, some of our patents could be held not infringed or invalid, permitting generic competition prior to their original expiration.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents in these fields has emerged to date in the United States. There have been recent changes regarding how patent laws are interpreted, and both the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and Congress have recently made significant changes to the patent system. There have been three U.S. Supreme Court decisions that now show a trend of the Supreme Court which is distinctly negative on patents. The trend of these decisions along with resulting changes in patentability\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 64\nrequirements being implemented by the USPTO could make it increasingly difficult for us to obtain and maintain patents on our products. We cannot accurately predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws which might be enacted into law. Those changes may materially affect our patents, our ability to obtain patents and/or the patents and applications of our collaborators and licensors. The patent situation in these fields outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents we own or to which we have a license or third-party patents.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022others may be able to make or use compounds that are the same or similar to the pharmaceutical compounds used in our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents or our in-licensed patents;\n\u2022the APIs in Fintepla may soon become commercially available in generic drug products, and no patent protection will be available without regard to formulation or method of use;\n\u2022the APIs in MT-1621 are well-known and available commercially from many sources, and no patent protection claiming the APIs as a composition of matter will be available;\n\u2022we or our licensors, as the case may be, may not be able to detect infringement against our patents or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents;\n\u2022we or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our owned or in-licensed issued patents or pending patent applications;\n\u2022we or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u2022it is possible that our owned or in-licensed U.S. patents are not Orange-Book eligible;\n\u2022it is possible that there are dominating patents to Fintepla and MT-1621 of which we are not aware;\n\u2022it is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our or our licensors\u2019 patents, as the case may be, or parts of our or their patents;\n\u2022it is possible that others may circumvent our owned or in-licensed patents;\n\u2022it is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our products or technology similar to ours;\n\u2022the claims of our owned or in-licensed issued patents or patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our system or products or our system of product candidates;\n\u2022our owned or in-licensed issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be narrowed in scope, be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal administrative challenges by third parties;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies for which we can obtain patent protection; or\n\u2022the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, state laws in the Unites States vary, and their courts as well as courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If our confidential or proprietary information is divulged to or\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 65\nacquired by third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets could be severely compromised.\nIf any of our owned or in-licensed patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and products.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nOur existing license with the Universities and Columbia impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market the affected products. If we lose such license rights, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected. We may enter into additional licenses in the future and if we fail to comply with obligations under those agreements, we could suffer similar consequences.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights to our products and technology.\nIf we or our collaborators or licensors choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions claimed in our owned or in-licensed patents, that third party may ask the court to rule that the patents are not infringed, invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we or they, as the case may be, were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we or they, as the case may be, do not have the right to stop others from using the inventions.\nThere is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the third party on the ground that such third-party\u2019s activities do not infringe our owned or in-licensed patents. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently changed some tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our own or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a reexamination or other post-grant proceeding before the USPTO, or during litigation, under the revised criteria which make it more difficult to obtain patents.\nWe may also not be able to detect infringement of our own or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for methods of manufacturing or formulation products. While we intend to take actions reasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights, we depend, in part, on our licensors and collaborators to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidate and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields relating to Fintepla and MT-1621. As the medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert that our products or product candidates infringe the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of medical devices, drugs, products or their methods of use. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our products, product candidates, technology or methods.\nIn addition, there may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware, that are infringed or are alleged to be infringed by our product candidate or proprietary technologies. Because (i) patent applications filed only in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, (ii) other United States patent applications and patent applications filed in many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after their filing date, (iii) publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 66\nlicensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party filed a U.S. patent application prior to March 16, 2013 on inventions similar to those owned or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such proceedings may be decided against us if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own or, if applicable, our licensor\u2019s invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, if another party has reason to assert a substantial new question of patentability against any of our claims in our owned and in-licensed U.S. patents, the third party can request that the USPTO reexamine the patent claims, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. We are currently defending an opposition to one of our patents in the European Patent Office, and in the future we may become a party to patent opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, Australian Patent Office or other jurisdictions where either our patents are challenged, or we are challenging the patents of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful. In any such proceedings, a court or other administrative body may decide that a patent of ours is invalid, in whole or in part or construe our patent\u2019s claims narrowly resulting in a loss of our patent position. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents.\nIf a third-party\u2019s patent was found to cover our product candidate, proprietary technologies or their uses, we or our collaborators could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies unless we or they obtained a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us or our collaborators on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies or methods pending a trial on the merits, which could be years away.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or our collaborators infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u2022a court order prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third party licenses its patent rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and\n\u2022redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 67\nPeriodic maintenance fees on our owned and in-licensed patents are due to be paid to the USPTO in several stages over the lifetime of the patents. Future maintenance fees will also need to be paid on other patents which may be issued to us or our licensors. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ outside firms to remind us or our in-licensor to pay annuity fees due to foreign patent agencies on our pending foreign patent applications. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and know-how, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If our confidential or proprietary information is divulged to or acquired by third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully generate revenues from our product candidates, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors.\nRisks Relating to the Securities Markets and an Investment in Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Since the commencement of trading in connection with our initial public offering in November 2010, the publicly traded shares of our common stock have themselves experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the price per share for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from a low sale price of $11.25 to a high sale price of $23.43. This market volatility is likely to continue. These and other factors could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could change significantly, both over short periods of time and the longer term, due to many factors, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the following:\n\u2022FDA or international regulatory actions and whether and when we receive regulatory approval for MT-1621;\n\u2022the development status of Fintepla or MT-1621, including the results from our clinical trials;\n\u2022variations in the level of expenses related to Fintepla or MT-1621 clinical development programs, including relating to the timing of invoices from, and other billing practices of, our CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other pharmaceutical companies and price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022deviations from securities analysts\u2019 estimates or the impact of other analyst comments;\n\u2022ratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 68\n\u2022third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u2022developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022developments affecting our contract manufacturers, component fabricators and service providers;\n\u2022the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, security breaches, system failures, public health crises, pandemics such as COVID-19 or responses to these events;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022discussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular the Nasdaq Global Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many pharmaceutical companies. Stock prices of many pharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including the risk factors described in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly because the success and costs of our Fintepla and MT-1621 development programs are uncertain and therefore our future prospects are uncertain. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022timing and level of commercial sales of Fintepla;\n\u2022variations in the level of development and/or regulatory expenses related to Fintepla and MT-1621 development programs;\n\u2022results of clinical trials for Fintepla or MT1621;\n\u2022any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022our ability to control production spending and underutilization of production capacity;\n\u2022those of our competitors; and\n\u2022our execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. We commenced the commercial launch of Fintepla in the United States in July 2020 and in Germany in February 2021. Additionally, from time to time, in addition to the existing Shinyaku Agreement, we may enter into collaborative arrangements with other companies that include development funding and significant upfront and milestone payments and/or royalties, which may become an important source of our revenue. Accordingly, our revenue may depend on development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones under current and any potential future collaborative arrangements and sales of Fintepla and our other products, if approved. Furthermore, revenues may consist of the recognition of deferred revenue from upfront, nonrefundable payments that we received from Shinyaku or payments we may receive under future collaboration agreements and the timing of recognizing deferred revenue is subject to significant management judgments,\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 69\nincluding estimating total costs at completion. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from period to period and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one period to the next. As a result, any period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe have been involved in securities class action litigation and may become involved in future securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally experience significant stock price volatility. We have in the past and may in the future become involved in securities class action litigation. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had research coverage by only nine securities analysts. If these securities analysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.\nPersons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering in November 2010 continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market, subject in some cases to certain legal restrictions. Significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders. If these stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 56.1 million shares of common stock outstanding. The majority of these shares are freely tradeable, without restriction, in the public market.\nIn addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and, in any event, we have filed a registration statement permitting shares of common stock issued on exercise of options to be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers have established, or may establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. Any sales of securities by these stockholders or executive officers and directors, or the perception that those sales may occur, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 70\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022a board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022a requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022a requirement of approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then- current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation in the market price of their stock, which may never occur.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAs a result of operating as a public company, we incur significant legal and accounting compliance costs and we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and we can provide no assurance that we will, at all times, in the future be able to report that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 71\ncontrols and procedures. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our future testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. In addition, we currently do not have an internal audit function, and we may in the future need to hire additional accounting and financial staff to establish such a function. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. If we cannot conclude that we have effective internal controls over our financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources.\nIn connection with the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations, we are required to make estimates and judgments which involve uncertainties, and any significant differences between our estimates and actual results could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Any significant differences between our actual results and our estimates and assumptions could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in accounting standards and their interpretations could adversely affect our operating results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various other bodies that promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. These principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nOur business and operations may suffer in the event of system failures, which could materially affect our results.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and those of our current and our partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to attack and damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses and malware (e.g., ransomware), unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage or disrupt, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. For example, we have been the target of cyber-attacks seeking to misappropriate our funds and have also experienced failures in our information systems and computer servers. We cannot be sure that similar cyber-attacks or failures will not occur in the future. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations, and can result in a material disruption of our commercialization activities, drug development programs and our business operations. The loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval and post-market study compliance efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Similarly, we rely on a large number of third parties to supply components for and manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems\nZogenix, Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 72\ncould also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability due to the delays in the development of our product candidates and/or due to reputational harm, litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement, fines and penalties, or increased costs of compliance and system remediation. Any losses, costs or liabilities may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any or all applicable insurance policies.", "PERMNO": 12413, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZGNX"}
