RISK FACTORS\nMany statements contained in this report are forward-looking in nature. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Form 10-K. These statements are based on current plans, intentions or expectations, and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following:\nBUSINESS RISKS\nOur results may be impacted by economic trends.\nOur net revenues increased in 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of acquisitions made during the year. Excluding the net revenues from these new radio stations and a divested radio station, net revenues improved in the low single digits for the year. The second half of the year reflected improvement over the first half of the year.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by delays or reversals in the economic recovery or by future economic downturns. Also, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions. The risks associated with our business could be more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. A decrease in advertising expenditures can have an adverse effect on our net revenues, profit margins, cash flow, and liquidity.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact on our ability to access capital, which may be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our capacity to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nOur radio stations may be adversely affected by changes in programming and competition for advertising revenues.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business. Our radio stations compete for audiences with advertising revenue as our principal source of income. We compete directly with other radio stations, as well as with other media, such as broadcast, cable and satellite television, digital audio, newspapers and magazines, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising and direct mail. Audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any decrease in our ratings or market share in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market. Audience ratings and market shares could be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the format or content of programming (some of which may be outside of our control), personnel changes, demographic shifts and general broadcast listening trends. Adverse changes in any of these areas or trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the market share mix of these competing mediums could also impact the advertising market share of radio advertising.\nWhile we already compete in some of our markets with stations with similarly programmed formats, if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations or if an existing competitor were to garner additional market share, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and/or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses. Competing companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we do. We cannot be assured that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues.\nWe cannot predict the competitive effect on the radio broadcasting industry of changes in audio content distribution, changes in technology or changes in regulations.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services. We may lack the resources to acquire new technologies or introduce new services to allow us to compete with these new offerings. Competing technologies and services, some of which are commercial free, include: personal audio devices; national and local digital audio services; satellite-delivered digital radio services; content available over the Internet; HD Radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services; and low-power FM radio, which could result in additional FM radio broadcast outlets, including additional low-power FM radio signals authorized in December 2010 under the Local Community Radio Act.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory changes may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulations and are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations. Failure to comply with such regulations could damage our business.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934. See Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting under Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d We are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our radio stations. Licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, we cannot be assured that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications. During the periods when a renewal application is pending, informal objections and petitions to deny the renewal application can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public, on a variety of grounds. Seven of our FCC radio station license renewal applications filed in the most recent 2011-2014 renewal period have not yet been granted. For five of those seven stations, license renewal applications filed during the prior 2003-2006 renewal application window have also not yet been granted. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations, and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, these FCC regulations may change over time, and we cannot be assured that changes would not have a material adverse effect on us. We are currently the subject of several pending investigations by the FCC, including one involving a death following a contest at one of our stations.\nCongress or federal agencies that regulate us could impose new regulations or fees on our operations that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere was proposed legislation in the past and there could be again in the future that requires radio broadcasters to pay additional fees such as a spectrum fee for the use of the spectrum. In addition, there was proposed legislation which would impose a new royalty fee that would be paid to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded music. It is currently unknown what impact any potential required royalty payments or fees would have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThe FCC has engaged in vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Over the last decade, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a \u201cserious\u201d indecency violation. Congress has dramatically increased the penalties for broadcasting obscene, indecent or profane programming, and these penalties may potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast such material. In addition, the FCC\u2019s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme, against the broadcast industry generally, may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations. Several of our stations are currently subject to indecency-related inquiries and/or proposed fines at the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau as well as objections to our license renewals based on such inquiries and proposed fines, and we may in the future become subject to additional inquiries or proceedings related to our stations\u2019 broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. To the extent that these inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key personnel. We believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur radio stations compete for creative and on-air talent with other radio stations and other media, such as broadcast, cable and satellite television, digital media and satellite radio. Our on-air talent are subject to change, due to competition and for other reasons. Changes in on-air talent could materially and negatively affect our ratings and our ability to attract local and national advertisers, which could in turn adversely affect our revenues.\nWe depend on selected market clusters of radio stations for a material portion of our revenues.\nFor 2015, we generated over 50% of our net revenues in seven of our 27 markets, which were Boston, Denver, Kansas City, Portland, Sacramento, San Francisco and Seattle. Accordingly, we have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions in any of these markets, such as changes in the economy, shifts in population or demographics, or changes in audience tastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions.\nThe integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired stations.\nThe risks of integration are magnified during any period of significant growth from acquisitions. We cannot be assured that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations, systems or management that might be acquired in future acquisitions. In addition, in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations, we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business.\nImpairments to our broadcasting licenses and goodwill have reduced our earnings.\nWe have incurred impairment losses that resulted in the non-cash write-downs of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill. A significant amount of these impairment losses were recorded in 2008 during the recession and the most recent impairment loss was recorded in 2012. As of December 31, 2015, our broadcasting licenses and goodwill comprise 82% of our total assets. The valuation of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill is subjective and based on our estimates and assumptions rather than precise calculations. The fair value measurements for both our broadcast licenses and goodwill use significant unobservable inputs and reflect our own assumptions including market share and profit margin for an average station, growth within a radio market, estimates of costs and losses during early years, potential competition within a radio market and the appropriate discount rate used in determining fair value. If events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the broadcasting licenses and goodwill below the amount reflected on the balance sheet, we may be required to recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods. Current accounting guidance does not permit a valuation increase.\nWe have significant obligations relating to our current operating leases.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had future operating lease commitments of approximately $114 million that are disclosed in Note 20 in the accompanying notes to the audited consolidated financial statements. We are required to make certain estimates at the inception of a lease in order to determine whether the lease is operating or capital. In February 2016, the accounting guidance was modified to require that all leases with a term of more than one year, covering leased assets such as real estate, broadcasting towers and equipment, be reflected on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by these leases. While we are currently reviewing the effects of this guidance, we believe that this would result in: (1) an increase in the assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets; and (2) an increase in our interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense and a decrease to our station operating expense reflected on our consolidated statements of operations. This guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nThe proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If these information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our operations may be adversely affected and operating results could be harmed. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the future growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party providers, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, computer system or network failures and natural disasters. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our business processes or information systems, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCybersecurity threats to our business\nThe use of our computers and digital technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations give rise to cybersecurity risks, including viruses or malware, physical or electronic intrusions and unauthorized access to\nour data. A cybersecurity attack could compromise confidential information. There can be no assurance that we, or the security systems we implement, will protect against all of these rapidly changing risks. A cyber-incident could increase our operating costs, disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, or subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data. We maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks, but cannot guarantee that such coverage will be applicable or sufficient with respect to any given incident or on-going incidents that go undetected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nCurrent and future indebtedness could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe have outstanding debt that could have an adverse impact on us. For example, these obligations:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability in an economic downturn, limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from taking advantage of opportunities to grow our business; and\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions.\nOur senior secured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) includes a $40 million revolving commitment (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) of which $13.3 million was undrawn and available to us as of December 31, 2015. In December 2015, we reduced the total Revolver capacity from $50 million to $40 million. The amount of the Revolver available to us is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing. Based on our financial covenant analysis as of December 31, 2015, we would not be limited in these borrowings. The Revolver matures on November 23, 2016. We expect to retire the Revolver using funds from operations. If we are not successful, a default under the Revolver could accelerate the due date for all of our outstanding debt.\nWe may from time to time seek to amend our existing debt agreements or obtain funding or additional debt financing, which may result in higher interest rates.\nWe must comply with the covenants in our debt agreements, which restrict our operational flexibility.\nOur Credit Facility, which was entered into in November 2011 and subsequently amended, and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) contain provisions which, under certain circumstances, limit our ability to borrow money; make acquisitions, investments or restricted payments, including without limitation dividends and the repurchase of stock; swap or sell assets; or merge or consolidate with another company. To secure the debt under our Credit Facility, we have pledged substantially all of our assets, including the stock or equity interests of our subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the parent and all of our existing subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Facility requires us to maintain compliance with specific financial covenants which are defined terms within the agreement, including: (1) a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio that cannot exceed 4.75 times at December 31, 2015, and which decreases to 4.50 times at March 31, 2016 and thereafter; and (2) a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.00 times at December 31, 2015 and thereafter.\nOur ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control, and we cannot be assured that we will comply with these covenants. A default under the indenture governing our Senior Notes or a default under our Credit Facility could cause a cross default. Any event of default, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of these financial instruments and the failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt and our lenders could proceed against our assets, including the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause of our holding company structure, we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow, and our access to this cash flow is restricted.\nWe operate as a holding company. All of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries. Entercom Radio, LLC (\u201cRadio\u201d), our 100% owned finance subsidiary, is the borrower under our Credit Facility and is the issuer of our Senior Notes. All of our station operating subsidiaries and FCC license subsidiaries are subsidiaries of Radio. Further, we guarantee Radio\u2019s obligations under the Credit Facility on a senior secured basis. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis. Radio\u2019s subsidiaries are all full and unconditional guarantors jointly and severally under the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes.\nAs a holding company, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, including corporate overhead and other expenses, is cash distributed from our subsidiaries. We currently expect that the majority of the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing Radio\u2019s debt obligations. Even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us, we cannot be assured that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the dividend covenants contained in our Credit Facility, would permit such dividends or distributions.\nOur variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under the Credit Facility could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our debt, could correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2015, and assuming the Revolver was fully drawn, a 100 basis point increase in London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) rates as of December 31, 2015 would result in a $1.4 million increase in annual interest expense on our debt (in this hypothetical assumption, a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR only partially impacted the interest on our Credit Facility\u2019s term loan (\u201cTerm B Loan\u201d) as the LIBOR rate on our Term B Loan is subject to a 100 basis point minimum).\nIn the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate risk. We may, however, not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate debt, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur debt has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in the rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings would likely make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STOCK\nOur Chairman of the Board and our President and Chief Executive Officer own a substantial equity interest in us and effectively control our Company. Their interests may conflict with your interest.\nAs of February 15, 2016, Joseph M. Field, our Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned 1,563,291 shares of our Class A common stock and 6,148,282 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 62% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock. As of February 15, 2016, David J. Field, our President and Chief Executive Officer, one of our directors and the son of Joseph M. Field, beneficially owned 3,214,068 shares of our Class A common stock and 749,250 shares of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 11% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock. Collectively, Joseph M. Field and David J. Field and other members of the Field family beneficially own all of our outstanding Class B common stock. Other members of the Field family and trusts for their benefit also own shares of Class A common stock.\nShares of Class B common stock are transferable only to Joseph M. Field, David J. Field, certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit. Upon any other transfer, shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Shares of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes only when Joseph M. Field or David J. Field vote them, subject to certain exceptions when they are restricted to one vote. Joseph M. Field generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders and, therefore, is able to direct our management and policies, except with respect to those matters when the shares of our Class B common stock are only entitled to one vote and those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws or applicable law, including, without limitation, the election of the two Class A directors.\nFuture sales by Joseph M. Field and/or David J. Field could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nThe price for our Class A common stock could fall substantially if Joseph M. Field and/or David J. Field sell in the public market or transfer large amounts of shares, including any shares of our Class B common stock which are automatically converted to Class A common stock when sold (as described in the above paragraph). These sales, or the possibility of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future.\nThe difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our Company could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nJoseph M. Field controls the decision as to whether a change in control will occur for our Company. There are also provisions contained in our articles of incorporation, by-laws and Pennsylvania law that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In addition, FCC approval for transfers of control of FCC licenses and assignments of FCC licenses is required. These restrictions and limitations could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class A stock price and trading volume could be volatile.\nOur Class A common stock has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) since January 29, 1999. The market price of our Class A common stock and our trading volume have been subject to fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could experience volatility, regardless of our operating performance.\nOur newly issued perpetual cumulative convertible preferred stock could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We have issued 11 shares with a liquidation preference of $2.5 million per share. Our Board of Directors has the authority to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of our preferred stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.", "PERMNO": 86560, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "ETM"}
