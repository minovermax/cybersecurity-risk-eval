The risk factors discussed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. If any of these risks actually materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects could be negatively impacted. These risks are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business.\nGeneral Risks of the Company\nWe rely on offshore sourcing, particularly from China, for predominantly all of our casegoods furniture products and for a significant portion of our upholstered products. Consequently:\n\u00a7\nA disruption in supply from China or from our most significant Chinese supplier could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nIn fiscal 2016, imported products sourced from China and Vietnam accounted for approximately 68% and 26%, respectively, of our import purchases and the factory in China from which we directly source the largest portion of our import products accounted for approximately 58% of our worldwide purchases of imported products. Furniture manufacturing creates large amounts of highly flammable wood dust and utilizes other highly flammable materials such as varnishes and solvents in its manufacturing processes and is therefore subject to the risk of losses arising from explosions and fires. A disruption in our supply chain from this factory, or from China or Vietnam in general, could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country. If such a disruption were to occur, we believe that we would have sufficient inventory on hand and in transit to our U.S. warehouses in Martinsville, VA to adequately meet demand for approximately 4.5 months with up to an additional 1.25 months available for immediate shipment from our warehouses in Asia. We believe that we could, most likely at higher cost, source most of the products currently sourced in China from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories. However, supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to 6 months before the impact of remedial measures would be reflected in our results. If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier, or from China or Vietnam in general, could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u00a7\nWe are subject to changes in foreign government regulations and in the political, social and economic climates of the countries from which we source our products.\nChanges in political, economic, and social conditions, as well as in the laws and regulations in the foreign countries from which we source our products could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. These changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to our customers or could increase the cost of those products. International trade regulations and policies of the United States and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us. Imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports affecting our products could increase our costs and decrease our earnings. For example since 2004, the U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the United States from China. In this case, none of the rates imposed have been of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way; however, these and other tariffs are subject to review and could be implemented or increased in the future.\n\u00a7\nOur dependence on non-U.S. suppliers could, over time, adversely affect our ability to service customers.\nWe rely exclusively on non-U.S. suppliers for our casegoods furniture products and for a significant portion of our upholstered products. Our non-U.S. suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality, design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price. If our suppliers do not meet our specifications, we may need to find alternative vendors, potentially at a higher cost, or may be forced to discontinue products. Also, delivery of goods from non-U.S. vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured furniture, such as shipment delays caused by customs issues, labor issues, port-related issues such as weather, congestion or port equipment, decreased availability of shipping containers and/or the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products. Our failure to timely fill customer orders due to an extended business interruption for a major non-U.S. supplier, or due to transportation issues, could negatively impact existing customer relationships and adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u00a7\nOur inability to accurately forecast demand for our imported products could cause us to purchase too much, too little or the wrong mix of inventory.\nManufacturing and delivery lead times for our imported products necessitate that we make forecasts and assumptions regarding current and future demand for these products. If our forecasts and assumptions are inaccurate, we may purchase excess or insufficient amounts of inventory. If we purchase too much or the wrong mix of inventory, we may be forced to sell it at lower margins, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. If we purchase too little or the wrong mix of inventory, we may not be able to fill customer orders and may lose market share and weaken or damage customer relationships, which also could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u00a7\nChanges in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nFor imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for periods of at least one year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk, but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. These price changes could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity during affected periods.\n\u00a7\nSupplier transitions, including cost or quality issues, could result in longer lead times and shipping delays.\nIn the past, inflation concerns, and to a lesser extent quality and supplier viability concerns, affecting some of our imported product suppliers located in China prompted us to source more of our products from lower cost suppliers located in other countries, such as Vietnam and Indonesia. As conditions dictate, we could be forced to make similar transitions in the future. When undertaken, transitions of this type involve significant planning and coordination by and between us and our new suppliers in these countries. Despite our best efforts and those of our new sourcing partners, these transition efforts are likely to result in longer lead times and shipping delays over the short term, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe interruption, inadequacy, security failure or integration failure of our information systems or information technology infrastructure or the internet could adversely impact our business, sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur information systems (software) and information technology (hardware) infrastructure platforms and those of third parties who provide these services to us, including internet service providers and third-parties who store data for us on their servers, facilitate and support every facet of our business, including the sourcing of raw materials and finished goods, planning, manufacturing, warehousing, customer service, shipping, accounting and human resources. Our systems, and those of third parties who provide services to us, are vulnerable to disruption or damage caused by a variety of factors including, but not limited to: power disruptions or outages; natural disasters or other so-called \u201cActs of God\u201d; computer system or network failures; viruses or malware; physical or electronic break-ins; the theft of computers, tablets and smart phones utilized by our employees or contractors; unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. If these information systems or technologies are interrupted or fail, our operations may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nUnauthorized disclosure of confidential information provided to us by our customers, employees, or third parties could harm our business.\nWe rely on the internet and other electronic methods to transmit confidential information and we store confidential information on our networks. If there was a disclosure of confidential information by our employees or contractors, including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of information, or if a third party were to gain access to the confidential information we possess, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions. A claim that is brought against us, successful or unsuccessful, that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, result in substantial costs, divert management attention and adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies, form strategic alliances and pursue new business lines. These activities could disrupt our business, dilute our earnings per share, decrease the value of our common stock and decrease our earnings and liquidity.\nWe may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages. However, we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that could negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth. We may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations. Acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business. We may pay for future acquisitions using cash, stock, the assumption of debt, or a combination of these. Future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock. We may pursue new business lines in which we have limited or no prior experience or expertise. These pursuits may require substantial investment of capital and personnel. New business initiatives may fail outright or fail to produce an adequate return, which could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe implementation of our Enterprise Resource Planning system could disrupt our business.\nWe are in the final phase of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in our legacy Hooker Furniture business. (HMI operates on a separate ERP platform.) Our ERP system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations. Our inability to mitigate existing and future disruptions could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. The ERP system implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems. These costs and risks could include, but are not limited to:\n\u00a7\nsignificant capital and operating expenditures;\n\u00a7\ndisruptions to our domestic and international supply chains;\n\u00a7\ninability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u00a7\ninability to process payments to suppliers, vendors and associates accurately and in a timely manner;\n\u00a7\ndisruption of our internal control structure;\n\u00a7\ninability to fulfill our SEC or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00a7\ninability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner; and\n\u00a7\nincreased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives.\nWe may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.\nWe grant payment terms to most customers ranging from 30 to 60 days and do not generally require collateral. However, in some instances we provide longer payment terms. Some of our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, credit-related issues. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment. Should more customers than we anticipate experience liquidity issues, or if payment is not received on a timely basis, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur new business initiatives could fail to meet growth and profitability targets.\nDuring fiscal 2014, we launched H Contract and Homeware, two new business initiatives which comprise our All Other operating segment. Both businesses require experience and expertise outside of our traditional skillset, so we hired professionals who we believe have the skills and experience to lead them. H Contract has been profitable on an operating profit basis for the last two fiscal years and its net sales have increased; however, there is no guarantee that H Contract\u2019s early successes will continue and that its sales and earnings will continue to grow. Homeware has not yet achieved operating profitability. Consequently, we adjusted Homeware\u2019s strategy during the second half of fiscal 2016. Despite these changes, we may not succeed in growing Homeware into a profitable business and it may fail outright or fail to produce an adequate return. We expect this segment to have a negative impact on our short-term earnings and liquidity as we attempt to grow these businesses. If Homeware fails to become profitable or H Contract\u2019s early successes diminish or stall, our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nA disruption affecting our Martinsville and Henry County Virginia warehouses, distribution or administrative facilities could disrupt our business.\nOur Martinsville and Henry County Virginia facilities are critical to our success. Our Martinsville, Virginia warehouses housed approximately 50% of our consolidated inventories at January 31, 2016. During fiscal 2016, approximately 60% of our invoiced sales were shipped out of our Martinsville facilities. Additionally, our corporate headquarters, which houses all of our corporate administration, sourcing, sales, finance, merchandising, customer service and traffic functions for our imported products is located in this area. Any disruption affecting our Martinsville area facilities, for even a relatively short period of time, could adversely affect our ability to ship our imported furniture products and disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur ability to grow and maintain sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of our business strategies.\nWe are primarily a residential furniture design, sourcing, marketing and logistics company with domestic upholstery manufacturing capabilities. We are completely dependent on non-U.S. suppliers for all of our casegoods furniture products and a significant portion of our upholstered products. Our ability to grow and maintain sales and earnings depends on:\n\u00a7\nthe continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of our overall business strategies and business systems for designing, marketing, sourcing, distributing and servicing our products;\n\u00a7\ngood decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets;\n\u00a7\nthe enhancement of relationships and business systems that allow us to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with our global sourcing suppliers; and\n\u00a7\nthe right mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products.\nOur traditional customer base, independent furniture stores and regional chains, is getting smaller and the demographic profile of the typical home furnishings consumer is evolving. Therefore, we must:\n\u00a7\nidentify and adapt to trends in retailing; and\n\u00a7\ndevelop strategies to sell in the channels in which our consumers prefer to shop.\nAll of these factors affect our ability to grow and maintain sales, earnings and liquidity.\nFailure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business.\nFurniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes, as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles. If we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. This could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nFluctuations in the price, availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase our costs.\nWe use various types of wood, leather, fabric, foam and other filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture. We depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We may not always be able to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers due to competition and other market pressures. The inability to meet customers\u2019 demands or recover higher costs could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines we may respond by realigning manufacturing.\nOur domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture. A decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of our domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost-saving measures. These programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures. We may decide to source certain products from other suppliers instead of continuing to manufacture them. These realignments and cost-saving measures typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near-term earnings before the expected cost savings are realized, if they are realized at all. We may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not achieve the expected cost savings, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may experience impairment of our long-lived assets, which would decrease our earnings and net worth.\nAccounting rules require that long-lived assets be tested for impairment when circumstances indicate, but at least annually. At January 31, 2016 we had $24.2 million in net long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, trademarks and trade names. The outcome of impairment testing could result in the write-off of all or a portion of the value of these assets. A write-down of our assets would, in turn, reduce our earnings and net worth; factors which may lead to additional write-downs of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to:\n\u00a7\nA significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset;\n\u00a7\nA significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset group is being used, or in its physical condition;\n\u00a7\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;\n\u00a7\nAn accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long-lived asset;\n\u00a7\nA current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with a long-lived asset\u2019s use; and\n\u00a7\nA current expectation that more-likely-than-not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nWe may not be able to maintain or raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.\nCompetitive and market forces could prohibit future successful price increases for our products in order to offset increased costs of finished goods, raw materials, freight and other product-related costs, which could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nEconomic downturns could result in decreased sales, earnings and liquidity.\nThe furniture industry is particularly sensitive to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Home furnishings are generally considered a postponable purchase by most consumers. Economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings. Changes in interest rates, consumer confidence, new housing starts, existing home sales, the availability of consumer credit and broader national or geopolitical factors have particularly significant effects on our business. A recovery in our sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn, due to, among other things, the postponable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings purchases. These events could also impact retailers, our primary customers, possibly adversely affecting our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nWe may lose market share due to competition.\nThe furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous domestic and non-U.S. residential furniture sources. Some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised, well-recognized, branded products. Competition from non-U.S. sources has increased dramatically over the past decade. We may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures, including increases in supplier and production costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products (through value and styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors. In addition, some large furniture retailers are sourcing directly from non-U.S. furniture factories. Over time, this practice may expand to smaller retailers. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe loss of several large customers through business consolidations, failures or other reasons could adversely affect our business.\nThe loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations, failures or otherwise, could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. Lost sales may be difficult to replace. Amounts owed to us by a customer whose business fails, or is failing, may become uncollectible, and we could lose future sales, any of which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may incur higher employee costs in the future.\nWe maintain a self-insured healthcare plan for our employees. We have insurance coverage in place for aggregate claims above a specified amount in any year. While our healthcare costs in recent years have generally increased at the same rate or greater than the national average, those costs have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. Continued inflation in healthcare costs, as well as additional costs we may incur as a result of current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, could significantly increase our employee healthcare costs in the future. Continued increases in our healthcare costs could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.\nHome furnishings sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in economic and competitive conditions, weather conditions and changes in consumer order patterns. From time to time, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility with respect to demand for our home furnishing products. The acquisition and integration of Home Meridian may increase that volatility. Accordingly, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for a full year.\nFuture costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results.\nOur business is subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, failure to comply with such laws and regulations, even inadvertently, could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact our operations and reputation.\nRisks Specific to the Acquisition and Integration of Home Meridian\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Home Meridian acquisition.\nWhile we believe that the Home Meridian acquisition will be accretive to our earnings per share beginning in fiscal 2017, this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. While we do not expect to merge operations or change customer-facing services, the success of this acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to improve each business by sharing best practices in order to lower costs, improve efficiencies and grow sales. There can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these benefits. Achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business acquired can be operated in the manner we intend. Events outside of our control could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition. Thus, the integration of Home Meridian\u2019s business may be unpredictable, subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired business will perform in accordance with our expectations, or that our expectations with respect to integration or benefits as a result of the acquisition will materialize. Additionally, a major asset acquired in this acquisition was Home Meridian\u2019s existing customer relationships. While we believe that these relationships will continue and result in profitable sales, there can be no assurance that they will.\nThe anticipated benefits and cost savings of the proposed acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. If the integration is not completed as planned, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe incurred significant debt to provide permanent financing for the acquisition.\nWe funded $60 million of the acquisition price with term loans. Acquisition-related principal and interest payments on the borrowed funds are expected to be approximately $7.0 million in fiscal 2017. We are subject to interest rate volatility due to the variable rates of interest on our loans. Among other risks, our debt:\n\u00a7\nmay limit our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt;\n\u00a7\nwill require a portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00a7\nmay result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates for both long-term debt as well as any borrowings under our line of credit at variable rates; and\n\u00a7\nmay require that additional terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us.\nThe intangible assets we expect to record as a result of the acquisition could become impaired.\nWe expect to account for this acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, which could result in charges to our earnings that could adversely affect our reported operating results. Under this method, we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from HMI based on their fair values as of February 1, 2016 (the date of the completion of the acquisition) and will record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of our businesses, we may be forced to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would reduce our reported assets, net income and shareholders\u2019 equity. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including: future business operating performance, changes in economic conditions and interest rates, regulatory, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, or changes in competition. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge which would adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nWe incurred significant acquisition and acquisition-related costs in connection with this transaction and expect to incur additional acquisition and integration-related costs in fiscal 2017.\nThrough the end of our 2016 fiscal year, we incurred approximately $1.1 million in deal-related costs and anticipate incurring approximately $1.5 million in additional deal and integration-related costs in fiscal 2017. We could encounter other integration-related costs or other factors, such as the failure to realize benefits anticipated from the proposed transaction, which could negatively impact the projected financial consequences of the acquisition and adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Our anticipated costs to achieve the integration of Home Meridian may differ significantly from our current estimates. The integration may place an additional burden on our management and internal resources, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention during the integration process could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and expected operating results. Any of these factors could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe assumed HMI\u2019s legacy pension plan obligations.\nWe assumed approximately $9.0 million of HMI\u2019s legacy pension plan obligations on the acquisition date of February 1, 2016. While the plan is frozen and no new participants are being added, we expect to be impacted by the plan\u2019s investment performance, changes in actuarial assumptions and the funded status of the plan, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Should we decide to terminate the pension plan in the future, we expect to record settlement expenses against our earnings and contribute a final cash contribution, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Specific to HMI\u2019s Operations or to the Operations of the Combined Entity\nAs previously mentioned, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Home Meridian International (HMI) subsequent to the end of our 2016 fiscal year and we are early into the process of integrating the two companies. The risks outlined above are forward looking, but are largely based on our operations before the completion of the acquisition on February 1, 2016. However, except for the risk factors above that deal with domestic manufacturing and upholstery operations, we believe that the risk factors disclosed represent, in all material respects, most of the risks of the combined companies. However, there are risk factors not detailed above that are either specific to Home Meridian\u2019s operations or different enough from those discussed above to warrant separate or additional disclosure:\nA material part of HMI\u2019s sales and accounts receivable are concentrated in a few customers, some of which are existing Hooker customers.\nSixty-percent of HMI\u2019s fiscal 2015 sales were concentrated in ten customers. Hooker sold to six of those ten customers during its 2016 fiscal year and sales to those customers accounted for nearly 12% of Hooker\u2019s fiscal 2016 sales. Two of those ten customers each accounted for over 10% of HMI\u2019s fiscal 2015 sales and both of those customers combined accounted for over 27% of HMI\u2019s total fiscal 2015 sales. Of those two customers, Hooker sold to only one during its 2016 fiscal year and those sales accounted for less than 1% of Hooker\u2019s fiscal 2016 sales. Those same two customers accounted for over 30% of HMI\u2019s accounts receivable at the end of its fiscal year on November 1, 2015. HMI\u2019s results will be included in Hooker\u2019s quarterly and annual fiscal 2017 results; however, we are early into the 2017 fiscal year and therefore unable to determine if the two customers referenced above will account for 10% or more of the combined entity\u2019s sales or accounts receivable for fiscal 2017. However, the loss of one or a combination of those customers, could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.\nA disruption affecting Home Meridian\u2019s Madison, NC, Mayodan, NC or Redlands, CA warehouses or its High Point, NC administrative facilities could disrupt our business.\nHome Meridian\u2019s domestic warehouses are critical to its success. Its division headquarters houses most of its administration, sourcing, sales, finance, merchandising, customer service and traffic functions. A disruption affecting any or a combination of these facilities, for even a relatively short period of time, could adversely affect its ability to ship its products and disrupt its business, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 89416, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "HOFT"}
