{"cik": "1305168", "company": "ARC DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks. The following risk factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and the price of our common stock. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Related to the Impact of the Novel Coronavirus (or COVID-19) Pandemic on Our Business\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 and beyond have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was initially reported and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has had a widespread and detrimental effect on the global economy and has created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets as a result of the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries and actions by public health and governmental authorities, businesses, other organizations and individuals to address the outbreak, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place, stay at home or lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. The duration and severity of COVID-19 and the degree of its impact on our business is uncertain and difficult to predict. The continued spread of the outbreak could result in one or more of the following conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition: decreased business spending by our customers and prospective customers; reduced demand for our products and services; increased customer losses; increased challenges in or cost of acquiring new customers; increased competition; increased risk in collectability of accounts receivable; reduced productivity due to remote work arrangements; lost productivity due to illness and/or illness of family members or adherence to mandated stay-at-home order; inability to hire key roles; adverse effects on our strategic partners\u2019 businesses; impairment charges; inability to recover costs from insurance carriers; business continuity concerns for us and our third-party vendors and suppliers; increased risk of privacy and cybersecurity breaches from increased remote working; and challenges with Internet infrastructure due to high loads. If we are not able to respond to and manage the potential impact of such events effectively, our business could be harmed.\nFurthermore, while many governmental authorities around the world have and continue to enact legislation to address the impact of COVID-19, including measures intended to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, we may not benefit from such legislation or such legislation may prove to be ineffective in addressing COVID-19\u2019s impact on our and our customer\u2019s businesses and operations. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the coronavirus\u2019 global economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Since the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us, or in a manner that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks to our operations.\nA substantial and sustained downturn in our operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors may cause us to be in breach of our Credit Agreement.\nWe are required to maintain certain financial ratios, specifically a total leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, under our Credit Agreement. We may be unable to comply with those financial ratios as a result of a substantial and sustained downturn in our operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If conditions change in the future and we expect to be out of compliance as a result, we would seek waivers from the lenders prior to any covenant violation. Any covenant waiver may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections that would be applicable. Absent a waiver or amendment from participating lenders, failure to meet the financial ratios and other covenants under our Credit Agreement would constitute an event of default and cause acceleration of the outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement, termination of the lenders\u2019 commitment to provide a revolving line of credit, an increase in our effective cost of funds and cross-default of other credit arrangements, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nAdverse domestic and/or global economic conditions and disruption of financial and commercial real estate markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA prolonged or severe economic downturn resulting from adverse domestic and/or global conditions, including epidemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak, may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and to perform their obligations under agreements with us. These restrictions could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, existing business, could limit new business, and could negatively affect our ability to collect on our accounts receivable on a timely basis, if at all. These events may, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nImpairment of goodwill due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect future results of operations.\nWe have intangible assets, including goodwill and other identifiable acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to prior acquisitions. We conduct annual goodwill impairment assessments, and interim impairment analyses on an as-needed basis if a triggering event occurs. Our 2020 annual assessment resulted in no goodwill impairment. The results of our impairment analyses, however, are as of a particular point in time. If our assumptions regarding future forecasted revenue or profitability of our reporting units are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods. The impact of COVID-19 has negatively affected certain key assumptions used in our analysis, and if the severity of the impact increases, we will need to assess the long-term impact to determine if we will be required to record charges for asset impairments in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly dependent on the architectural, engineering, construction and building owner/operator (AEC/O) industry and any decline in that industry could adversely affect our future revenue and profitability.\nWe estimate that customers in the AEC/O industry accounted for approximately 69% of our net sales in 2020; therefore, our results largely depend on the strength of that industry. Our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and variable nature of the AEC/O industry. We believe that the AEC/O industry generally experiences downturns several months after a downturn in the general economy, and that there may be a similar delay in the recovery of the AEC/O industry following a recovery of the general economy. A downturn in the AEC/O industry would diminish demand for some of our products and services, and would therefore negatively affect our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant percentage of net sales from within the State of California and our business could be disproportionately harmed by an economic downturn or natural disaster affecting California.\nWe derived approximately 32% of our net sales in 2020 from our operations in California. As a result, we are dependent to a large extent upon the AEC/O industry in California and, accordingly, we are sensitive to economic factors affecting AEC/O activity in California, including general and local economic conditions, macroeconomic trends, political factors affecting commercial and residential real estate development and natural disasters (including drought, earthquakes and wildfires). Any adverse developments affecting California could have a disproportionately negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to charge for our value-added services to offset declines in print volumes, our long-term revenue could decline.\nOur customers value the ability to view and order prints over the internet and print to output devices in their own offices and other locations throughout the country and the world. In 2020, our CDIM sales, which consists of the management, distribution, and production of documents and information related to construction projects, including large-format construction drawings, black and white and color signage, specification documents, and marketing material, represented approximately 61% of our total net sales, and our MPS represented approximately 27% of our total net sales. Both categories of revenue are generally derived from a charge per square foot of printed material. Future technology advances may further facilitate and improve our customers\u2019 ability to reduce print and the associated costs thereof. As technology continues to improve, this trend toward printing on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis could result in further decreased printing volumes and sales decline in the longer term. This was certainly evidenced during 2020 when offices shut down and people were forced to work from home leading to significant reduction in printing. Failure to offset these declines in printing volumes by changing how we charge for our services and develop additional revenue sources could significantly affect our business and reduce our long-term revenue, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to successfully market and execute several different, but related, service offerings. Failure to do so could impede our future growth and adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to offer and grow a variety of service offerings that are relatively new to the company. Our efforts will be affected by our ability to acquire new customers for our new service offerings as well as sell the new service offerings to existing customers. If we fail to procure new customers, our growth may be adversely affected and we may incur operating losses as a result of a failure to realize revenue from investments made in new service offerings.\nBecause a significant portion of our overall costs are fixed, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in revenue.\nOur network of service centers, equipment and related support activities involves substantial fixed costs which cannot be adjusted quickly to respond to declines in demand for our services. We estimate approximately 36% of our overall costs were fixed in 2020. As a consequence, our results of operations are subject to relatively high levels of volatility and our earnings could deteriorate rapidly in the face of declining revenues because our ability to reduce fixed costs in the short-term is limited. If we fail to manage our fixed costs appropriately, or to maintain adequate cash reserves to cover such costs, we may suffer material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon our vendors to continue to supply us with equipment, parts, supplies, and services at comparable terms and price levels as the business grows.\nOur access to equipment, parts, supplies, and services depends upon our relationships with, and our ability to purchase these items on competitive terms from our principal vendors. These vendors are not required to use us to distribute their equipment and are generally free to change the prices and other terms at which they sell to us. In addition, we compete with the selling efforts of some of these vendors. Our reliance on a limited number of principal vendors presents various risks. These include the risk that in the event of an interruption of relationships with our principal vendors for any reason, such as a natural catastrophe, epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or actions taken in regard to increased tariffs on goods produced in certain countries such as China, we may not be able to develop an alternate source without incurring material additional costs and substantial delays. Significant deterioration in relationships with, or in the financial condition of, these significant vendors could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell equipment as well as our ability to provide effective service and technical support. If one of these vendors terminates or significantly curtails its relationship with us, or if one of these vendors ceases operations, we would be forced to expand our relationships with our other existing vendors or seek out new relationships with previously unused vendors.\nOur failure to adequately protect the proprietary aspects of our technology, including SKYSITE, PlanWell, and Abacus may cause us to lose market share.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect and preserve the proprietary aspects of our technology products. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, license agreements, non-competition agreements, reseller agreements, customer contracts, and technical measures to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. These protections, however, may not be adequate to remedy harm we suffer due to misappropriation of our proprietary rights by third parties. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. It is also possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, allowing others to use our intellectual property to our competitive detriment. We also must ensure that all of our products comply with existing and\nnewly enacted regulatory requirements in the countries in which they are sold. Furthermore, we may, from time to time, be subject to intellectual property litigation which can be expensive, a burden on management\u2019s time and our Company\u2019s resources, and the outcome of any such litigation may be uncertain.\nCompetition in our industry and innovation by our competitors may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive, with competition primarily at local and regional levels. We compete primarily based on the level and quality of customer service, technological leadership, and price. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to improve our service and product offerings, and develop and integrate new technology solutions. In addition, current and prospective customers may decide to perform certain services themselves instead of outsourcing these services to us. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.\nWe also face the possibility that competition will continue to increase, particularly if copy and printing or business services companies choose to compete in lines of business similar to ours. Many of these companies are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources than us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we could encounter competition in the future from large, well-capitalized companies such as equipment dealers and system integrators that can produce their own technology and leverage their existing distribution channels. Any such future competition could adversely affect our business and reduce our future revenue and profitability.\nOur failure to comply with laws related to privacy and data security could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. In particular, health-related laws and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, may also have an impact on our business. For example, we offer HIPAA-compliant capabilities to certain customers who are \u201ccovered entities\u201d under HIPAA, which may include our execution of HIPAA Business Associate Agreements, or BAAs, with such covered entities. In addition, changes in applicable laws and regulations may result in the user data we collect being deemed protected health information under HIPAA. If we are unable to comply with the applicable privacy and security requirements, we could be subject to claims, legal liabilities, penalties, fines, and negative publicity, which could harm our operating results.\nOur computer hardware and software and telecommunications systems are susceptible to damage, breach or interruption.\nThe management of our business is aided by the uninterrupted operation of our computer and telecommunication systems. These systems are vulnerable to security breaches, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, computer viruses, or other interruptions or damage stemming from power outages, equipment failure or unintended usage by employees. In particular, our employees may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. In addition, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, partners and consultants, including through cloud-based platforms often provided by third parties. The breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches. Security breaches, including cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions by computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber terrorists or others with grievances against the industry in which we operate or us in particular, may disable or damage the proper functioning of our networks and systems. It is possible that our security controls, or those of the third parties with whom we partner, over personal and other data may not prevent unauthorized access to, or destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of personally identifiable or other proprietary, confidential, sensitive or valuable information of ours or others; this access could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential Company or client information that others could use to compete against us or for other disruptive, destructive or harmful purposes and outcomes. Any such disclosure or damage to our networks, or those of the third parties with whom we partner, and systems could subject us to third party claims against us and reputational harm. If these events occur, our ability to attract new clients may be impaired or we may be subjected to damages or penalties. In addition, system-wide or local failures of these information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDamage or disruption to our facilities, including our technology center, could impair our ability to effectively provide our services and may have a significant effect on our revenues, expenses and financial condition.\nOur IT systems are an important part of our operations. We currently store customer data at servers hosted by Amazon Web Services and at our technology center located in San Ramon, California near known earthquake fault zones. Although we have redundant systems and offsite backup procedures in place, interruption in service, damage to or destruction of our technology center or a disruption of our data storage processes resulting from sustained process abnormalities, human error, acts of terrorism, violence, war or a natural disaster, such as fire, earthquake or flood, could result in delays, in reduced levels of customer service and have a material adverse effect on the markets in which we operate and on our business operations.\nAlthough we currently maintain general property damage insurance, if we incur losses from uninsured events, we could incur significant expenses which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn performing our document management services, we handle customers\u2019 confidential information. Our failure to protect our customers\u2019 confidential information against security breaches could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur document management services involve the handling of our customers\u2019 confidential information. Any compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability, which could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operation.\nAdded risks are associated with our international operations.\nWe have international operations in China, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, and Australia. Approximately 13% of our revenues for 2020 were derived from our international operations, with approximately 4% derived from China. Our future revenues, costs of operations and net income could be adversely affected by a number of factors related to our international operations, including changes in economic conditions from country to country (resulting from epidemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak or otherwise), currency fluctuations, changes in a country\u2019s political condition, trade protection measures, licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues.\nA large percentage of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside of the United States, and we could be subject to repatriation delays and costs which could reduce our financial flexibility.\nApproximately 31% of our cash and cash equivalents are currently held outside the United States. Repatriation of some of the funds could be subject to delay for local country approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences. As a result of holding cash and cash equivalents outside of the U.S., our financial flexibility may be reduced.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract, retain, and successfully integrate skilled personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to attract, retain, and successfully integrate qualified personnel is critical to our success. As we continue to place more emphasis on document management and storage technology, our need to hire and retain software and other technology focused personnel has and can be expected to continue to increase. Competition for such personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is intense. If we lose key personnel and/or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to manage and grow our business will be adversely affected. In addition, the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team would disrupt our business and impede our ability to successfully execute our business strategy.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs and periodic litigation that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a number of risks inherent to our status as an employer including without limitation:\n\u2022claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees, discrimination or harassment claims against our employees, or claims by our employees of discrimination or harassment;\n\u2022claims relating to violations of wage, hour and other workplace regulations;\n\u2022claims relating to employee benefits, entitlements to employee benefits, or errors in the calculation or administration of such benefits; and\n\u2022possible claims relating to misuse of customer confidential information, misappropriation of assets or other similar claims.\nIf we experience significant incidents involving any of the above-described risk areas we could face substantial out-of-pocket losses, or fines. In addition, such claims may give rise to litigation, which may be time consuming, distracting and costly, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any change to them impacting our markets, could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws govern such issues as wastewater, storm water, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, air quality and matters of workplace safety. Under these laws and regulations, regardless of fault we may be liable for, among other things, the cost of investigating and remediating contamination. The amount of any such expense or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial. We cannot predict the potential financial impact on our business if adverse environmental, health, or safety conditions are discovered, or environmental, health, and safety requirements become more stringent. If we are required to incur environmental, health, or safety compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated and accrued by us, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, depending on the magnitude of the cost.\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax provisions are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of tax provision is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the U.S., which represents a majority of our operations, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms that may impact us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our federal corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes, and the taxation of foreign earnings. It is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of proposed or future changes, but such changes could have a material impact on our business.\nResults of tax examinations may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe are subject to various tax examinations on an ongoing basis. Adverse results of tax examinations for income, payroll, value added, sales-based and other taxes may require future material tax payments if we are unable to sustain our position with the relevant jurisdiction. Where appropriate, we have made accruals for these matters which are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur debt instruments impose certain restrictions on our ability to operate which in turn could negatively affect our ability to respond to business and market conditions and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $97.2 million in outstanding short and long-term borrowings under our credit facilities, and finance leases, excluding trade payables and operating leases. The terms of the agreements under which this indebtedness was incurred may limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to incur certain additional debt, make certain restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nWe are also required to maintain a total leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio under our credit agreement. Our inability to meet these ratios could result in the acceleration of the repayment of the outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement, the termination of the lenders\u2019 commitment to provide our revolving line of credit thereunder, the increase in our effective cost of funds or the cross-default of other credit arrangements. As a result, our ability to operate may be restricted and our ability to respond to business and market conditions may be limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf the interest rates on our borrowings increase, our access to capital and net income could be adversely affected.\nOur Credit Agreement and finance leases are variable-rate instruments which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, debt service obligations and our interest expense will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same. Our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nAn increase in interest rates may increase our future borrowing costs and restrict our access to capital. Additionally, current market conditions, the recovering global economy, and overall credit conditions could limit our availability of capital, which could cause increases in interest margin spreads over underlying indices, effectively increasing the cost of our borrowing. While some of our debt instruments have contractually negotiated spreads, any changes to these spreads in connection with renegotiation of our Credit Agreement or finance leases could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe interest rates under our Credit Agreement may be adjusted for the phase-out of LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We generally use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our Credit Agreement. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. SOFR may be more volatile than LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR, and the interest rate under our Credit Agreement may change. The new rates may not be as favorable to us as those currently in effect. We may also find it desirable to engage in more frequent interest rate hedging transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market prices of our common stock is volatile, and is impacted by factors other than our financial performance, which could cause the value of an investment in our stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the closing price of our common stock had fluctuated from a low of $0.51 to a high of $1.48 per share. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in the market prices of our common stock include:\n\u2022failure to sustain an active, liquid trading market for our shares;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or failure to meet analysts' performance expectations;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022sales of our capital stock by our directors or executive officers;\n\u2022the gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors' businesses, such as announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances, or in the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022investors' general perception of us;\n\u2022our stock repurchase program; and\n\u2022changes in general economic, industry and market conditions.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected our stock price. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Recent stock\nmarket fluctuations related to the current COVID-19 pandemic have been particularly significant. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to our operating performance. Factors that can cause such fluctuations include the impact of natural disasters and global events, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, general market fluctuations and macroeconomic conditions, any of which may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate widely.\nIn the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention as well as our other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends in the past. Management resumed declaring quarterly dividends in the fourth quarter of 2020, with approval by our Board of Directors, and share repurchases. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with applicable laws. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time. Management currently intends to continue quarterly dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and share repurchases, but cannot provide any assurance as to the timing, sustainability, or of any particular amounts of any such dividends and share repurchases in the future. A suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and returns on investment to our shareholders.\nIf we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, if we are not able to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, which require, among other things, that the average closing price of our common stock be above $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days, our common stock may be delisted. The closing price of our common stock on February 22, 2021 was $2.45, and on December 31, 2020, closed at $1.48. If we are unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; decreasing our analyst coverage; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, delisting from the NYSE might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, its business.", "PERMNO": 90548, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "ARC"}
