RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Report, you should carefully consider the risks described below that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. These risks are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nChanges in our relationships with our vendors, changes in import tax policy or trade relations, interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA number of our equipment suppliers and vendors are based outside the United States, with China serving as a significant non-US source for our telecommunications and solar equipment. Because a large portion of our equipment is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, major changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported products or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity and net income. In addition, governmental restrictions on the procurement of equipment from certain Chinese vendors could result in a costly network replacement build that, if not offset by government support, could adversely affect our results of operations. Although the FCC has initiated proceedings to develop a replacement and reimbursement program, and Congress has appropriated funds for the purpose, if we are not able to access the funds that are necessary to remove equipment from restricted vendors or are unable to complete the removal and replacement in the time frame specified in any final rules, it could adversely our ability to operate, maintain or expand our domestic network infrastructure.\nFailure of network or information technology systems, including as a result of security breaches, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are highly dependent on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for the operation of our network, our facilities, delivery of services to our customers and the compilation of our financial results. Failure of these IT systems, through cyberattacks, breaches of security, or otherwise, may cause disruptions to our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prevent a material security breach stemming from future cyberattacks. Our inability to operate our network, facilities and back office systems as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and impact the timely and accurate delivery of our services or other information. Other risks that may also cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for our customers include power loss, increasing reliance on cloud-storage providers (which may themselves be subject to cyberattack or breach), capacity limitations, software defects and breaches of security by computer viruses, break-ins or otherwise. Specifically, we have seen a rise in ransomware attacks in recent years. Telecommunications providers are increasingly being targeted by cyber criminals not necessarily for data about their own business, but access to the data of market participants in potentially more lucrative industries. Disruptions in our networks and the unavailability of our services or our inability to efficiently and effectively complete necessary technology or systems upgrades, or conversions could lead to a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and violation of the terms of our licenses and contracts with customers. Additionally, breaches of security may lead to unauthorized access to our customer or employee information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our IT systems. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, and we may be subject to litigation, regulatory penalties and financial losses. These failures could also lead to significant negative publicity.\nInclement weather and changes in meteorological conditions may materially disrupt our operations.\nMany of the areas in which we operate have experienced severe weather conditions over the years including hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, fires, damaging storms and floods. Such events may materially disrupt and adversely affect our business operations, such as the impacts of the hurricanes in the US Virgin Islands in 2017, which we assessed caused damage and losses to our wireline and wireless networks of approximately $100 million in operating losses and network rebuilding costs prior to insurance and any other recovery assistance. Major hurricanes also passed directly over Bermuda in the past decade, causing damage to our network and to the island\u2019s infrastructure. Guyana and Cayman have suffered from severe rains and flooding in the past as well. These types of events can also cause major disruption and harm to the communities and markets we serve, which can have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be sure that these types of events will not have an impact in the future or that we can procure insurance coverage against these types of severe weather events under reasonable business terms and conditions, or that any insurance coverage we are able to maintain will adequately compensate us for all damage and economic losses resulting from natural catastrophes. In addition, it may take significant time to return to pre-storm levels following any such storm or meteorological event. If we are unable to restore service on a timely and cost-effective basis, it could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations through continued loss of revenue and customer attrition to our competitors.\nIn addition, the impacts of climate change may exacerbate the risk of significant damage in the areas in which we operate. For example, rising ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean may result in the intensification of hurricanes over time. Heat waves and severe drought may lead to stronger and more frequent wildfires that could threaten our towers and installed equipment or result in loss of power. Rising sea levels and associated flooding may impact our retail and enterprise customers that operate businesses on the coasts of the United States and in our island markets. As the frequency or duration of more intense weather events increase, the likelihood of significant damage also increases. After major events such as hurricanes, earthquakes or wild fires, which can cause significant destruction to the power grid, our ability to access sites and facilities, obtain fuel and receive sufficient fuel supplies in order to provide power for stand-by generators is often severely limited, and in many cases, is not possible for extended periods of time. Our ability to access ports in order to obtain relief and supplies for affected areas will also likely be significantly hampered for extended periods of time.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively meet our obligations to AT&T related to its partnership with the First Responder Network Authority.\nOn July 31, 2019, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Commnet Wireless, entered into a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement with AT&T Mobility LLC (\u201cAT&T\u201d), pursuant to which Commnet will engineer, construct, commission, and maintain a radio access network (\u201cRAN\u201d) for AT&T for its commercial use and also in support of AT&T\u2019s public/private partnership with the First Responder Network Authority (\u201cFirstNet Authority\u201d). In connection with the Network Build & Maintenance Agreement, we are required to build a network in portions of several states in accordance with AT&T\u2019s detailed specifications by specified milestone dates and thereafter, to maintain the network in accordance with certain quality metrics. Such services are structured as a set cost agreed upon with AT&T, to be paid over the initial eight year term of the Network Build and Maintenance Agreement. AT&T has the right to terminate this agreement, including its obligation to pay for ongoing maintenance of the sites, in the event that Commnet fails to meet certain milestones or completion dates with respect to the construction of the sites, or fails to meet certain quality metrics and service level agreements (\u201cSLAs\u201d) with respect to maintenance services for the built sites.\nOur ability to meet required milestones and completion dates and perform the SLAs is dependent on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to procure equipment and negotiate favorable payment and other terms with suppliers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to effectively manage the construction of each of the cell sites, including securing reliable and efficient field construction resources; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to cost effectively and reliably deliver and manage the network in accordance with SLAs for both the AT&T commercial and FirstNet Authority networks.\nIn addition, construction of the cell sites may be also adversely affected by circumstances outside of our control, including inclement weather, adverse geological and environmental conditions, a failure to receive regulatory approvals or necessary permits on schedule or third-party delays in providing supplies and other materials. Further, our ability to undertake construction activities and the availability of our workforce may be impacted by shutdowns due to COVID-19, or our personnel actually contracting the virus. Any construction setbacks or delays could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our ability to perform under the time conditions and strict budget required under the Network Build and Maintenance Agreement.\nIf AT&T were to terminate the Network Build & Maintenance Agreement, this could have a material adverse impact on our prospects and results of operations in our US Telecom segment as we would have incurred costs to construct the sites, but might not be fully compensated for the construction of the sites through the initial term of the Agreement.\nThe continued impact of COVID-19 may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus, now referred to as COVID-19, as a pandemic, as the virus spread globally to multiple countries, including the United States and other countries in which we have substantial operations. The pandemic has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to global business activities and capital markets around the world.\nWe are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercial operations, including any potential impact on our revenue in 2021. However, the ultimate extent to which this pandemic impacts our business will depend upon the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, as well as the timing and rollout of approved vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19 and the impact on the economies in which we operate. For example, the local economies of many of our Caribbean markets are tourism-dependent and the ongoing decline in global travel activity resulting from COVID-19 may continue to impact our revenue and cash flows for certain services in these markets as our retail and enterprise customers are impacted, and we may continue to experience a decline in roaming revenue due to lack of travel to and from these markets.\nAdditionally, governmental actions in our jurisdictions intended to contain the COVID-19 outbreak have placed restrictions on travel and movement, resulting in significant business interruptions to both our business and that of our customers, delays in receipt of governmental approvals and permits, the acceleration of \u201cpopulation flight\u201d from island markets, and supply chain delays in the procurement process causing delays in our scheduled build plans, including with respect to planned fiber optic installations and maintenance in our Caribbean markets and our ongoing construction pursuant to our FirstNet Agreement with AT&T. Any prolonged interruption could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our services on a timely basis or at all and our ability to expand, as well as the ability of our field technicians to service our (or with respect to FirstNet, our customer\u2019s) telecommunications network. For more information about the risks to our business with respect to failure to perform under our FirstNet Agreement, see \u201cOperational Risks -- We may not be able to timely and effectively meet our obligations to AT&T related to its partnership with the First Responder Network Authority.\u201d\nWe may have difficulty meeting the growing demand for data services.\nDemand for smartphones and data services continues to grow across all of our wireless markets and we have seen an acute increase for such demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our value to our customers in some markets depends in part on our network\u2019s ability to provide high-quality and high capacity network service to smartphone devices. Indeed, much of the revenue growth in our wireless businesses in the past few years has been attributable to increased demand for data services. However, if data usage increases faster than we anticipate and exceeds the then-available capacity of any of our networks, our costs to deliver services may be higher than we anticipate. In the United States, the dearth of available spectrum and/or non-transparent spectrum allocation practices in our other markets means that we cannot guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional spectrum in a timely fashion, at a reasonable cost, or at all to ensure our ability to maintain or grow our business and traffic volumes. As demand for advanced mobile data services continues to grow, we may have difficulty satisfying our retail and wholesale customers\u2019 demand for these services without substantial upgrades and additional capital expenditures and operating expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to recruit and retain experienced management and technical personnel could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to maintain internal controls.\nThe success of our business depends on the ability of our executive officers and the officers of our operating units to develop and execute on our business plan, and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations, as well as on our ability to attract and retain these officers and other highly qualified technical and management personnel. If our executive officers and the officers of our operating units are not able to execute on our business plan, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we believe that there is, and will continue to be, strong competition for qualified personnel in the communications and energy industries and in our markets, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. We rely heavily on local management to run our operating units. Many of the markets in which we operate are small and remote, and in some cases are subject to government restrictions on granting work visas, which could make it difficult for us to attract and retain talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets. The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract or retain personnel with the sophistication to run complicated communications equipment, networks and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our key employees and none of the executives at our parent company have executed employment agreements.\nThe shift across the world from in-person to remote working may have both negative and positive impacts on our businesses. On one hand, if we are able to hire more remote workers who do not necessarily have to reside in-market, it will expand our talent pool and broaden our hiring capabilities. On the other hand, the more our workforce shifts to remote workers, new challenges present themselves such as providing adequate training and on-boarding, and keeping staff engaged and connected to their colleagues and the increased risk of recruitment by firms that also offer remote work options. In addition, cultural differences abroad and local practices of conducting business in our foreign operations may not be in line with business practices, recordkeeping and ethics standards in the United States. In order to continue to ensure compliance with foreign and US laws, accounting standards and our own corporate policies, we have\nimplemented financial and operational controls, created an internal audit team responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with our internal accounting controls, and routinely train our employees, vendors and consultants. However, having substantial foreign operations also increases the complexity and difficulty of developing, implementing and monitoring these internal controls and procedures. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty securing video services content from third parties desirable to our customers on terms and conditions favorable to us.\nWe have secured licensing agreements with numerous content providers to allow our various video services businesses to offer a wide array of popular programming to our subscribers. Typically, we make long-term commitments relating to these rights in advance even though we cannot predict the popularity of the services or ratings the programming will generate. License fees may be negotiated for a number of years and may include provisions requiring us to pay part of the fees even if we choose not to distribute such programming.\nThe success of our video services operations depends on our ability to access an attractive selection of video programming from content providers on terms and pricing favorable to us. Our ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming is a major factor that attracts subscribers to our services. Our inability to provide the content desired by our subscribers on satisfactory terms or at all could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue from, our cable operations that may not offset the typically large subscription fees that we pay for these services. In certain cases, we may not have satisfactory contracts in place with the owners of our distributed content, leading to such parties\u2019 desire for increased renewed contractual pricing or leading to disputes with such parties including claims for copyright or other intellectual property infringement.\nThe cost of obtaining programming associated with providing our video services is significant. Many of our programming contracts are for multiple year terms and provide for future increases in the fees we must pay. In addition, local over-the-air television stations are increasingly seeking substantial fees for retransmission of their stations over our cable networks. Historically, we have absorbed increased programming costs in large part through increased prices to our customers. We cannot assure that competitive and other marketplace factors will permit us to continue to pass through these costs or that we will be able to renew programming agreements on comparable or favorable terms. Also, programming in the Caribbean typically includes Latin American or Spanish programming, while our subscribers typically prefer content in English. An additional risk with respect to video services is increased competition from so-called \u201cover the top\u201d (\u201cOTT\u201d) media service providers. Additionally, more and more content providers have launched their own OTT offerings, for example Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Disney+, and others. As these and other OTT offerings gain market share, it may result in a loss of subscribers across our businesses that offer video services because customers are more attracted to these alternative offerings, or to the extent we are no longer able to offer programming that customers want either due to exclusive licensing arrangements or prohibitive rising costs. To the extent that we are unable to reach acceptable agreements with programmers or obtain desired content, we may be forced to remove programming from our line-up, which could result in a loss of customers and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for the timely supply of handsets, accessories, equipment and services relating to our network or facility infrastructure. If these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain sufficient quantities of the products and services we require to operate our businesses successfully.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our handset lineup, network infrastructure, and our back-office IT systems infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components and other equipment on a timely basis, our subscriber or revenue growth and operating results could suffer significantly. In addition, the size of our business relative to our competitors puts us at a disadvantage in terms of whether we will get access to the newest technologies at the same time as our competitors, as well as a financial disadvantage in terms of the ability to achieve economies of scale and receive commensurate discounts that may be available to our competitors.\nWe source wireless devices for our retail wireless businesses from a small number of handset resellers and to a lesser extent, equipment manufacturers and depend on access to compelling devices at reasonable prices on primary and secondary markets for these devices, as well as timely delivery of devices to meet market demands. The inability to provide a competitive device lineup could materially impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Moreover, as we increasingly roll out new products such as voLTE, we will increasingly rely on cooperation from our handset suppliers to ensure interoperability between devices and our network. Without close relationships with suppliers who understand the needs of our business, we may be delayed in deploying the handsets, accessories and equipment that our customers demand. We are also reliant upon a limited number of network equipment manufacturers, including Ericsson and Nokia.\nStrategic Risks\nRapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry may adversely affect us.\nOur industry faces rapid and significant changes in technology that directly impact our business, including the following:\n\u25cf\nmigration to new-generation services such as \u201c5G\u201d network technology;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of new telecom delivery platforms such as next generation satellite services;\n\u25cf\nevolving industry standards;\n\u25cf\nrequirements resulting from changing regulatory regimes;\n\u25cf\nthe allocation of radio frequency spectrum in which to license and operate wireless services;\n\u25cf\nongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology;\n\u25cf\nchanges in end-user requirements and preferences;\n\u25cf\nconvergence between video and data services;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of data and broadband capabilities and rapidly expanding demand for those capabilities;\n\u25cf\nincreased reliance on third-party cloud storage providers for data storage; and\n\u25cf\nconsolidation among service providers within the industry.\nFor us to keep pace with these technological changes and remain competitive, at a minimum we must continue to make significant capital expenditures to add to our networks\u2019 capacity, coverage and technical capability. For example, we have spent considerable amounts adding higher speed and capacity mobile data services to many of our networks in recent years and we think it likely that more such expenditures, including mobile and wireless data capabilities and high capacity, low latency backhaul, will be needed over the next few years.\nWe cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. Alternative or new technologies may be developed that provide communications services superior to those available from us, which may adversely affect our business. For example, to accommodate the demand from our wireless customers for next-generation advanced wireless products such as high-speed data and streaming video, we may be required to purchase additional spectrum, however, we have had difficulty finding spectrum for sale or on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, usage of wireless voice or broadband services in excess of our expectations could strain our capacity, cause service disruptions and result in higher operating costs and capital expenditures. In each of our markets, providing more and higher speed data services through our wireless or wireline networks may require us to make substantial investments in additional telecommunications transport capacity connecting our networks to the Internet, and in some cases such capacity may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Failure to provide these services or to upgrade to new technologies on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost, or to secure any necessary regulatory approvals to roll out such new technologies on a timely basis all could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with carriers in our markets.\nIncreased competition may adversely affect growth, require increased capital expenditures, result in the loss of existing customers and decrease our revenues.\nWe face competition in the markets in which we operate. For example:\n\u25cf\nIn the United States, our greatest competitive risk to our wholesale wireless business is the possibility that our current roaming customers may elect to build or enhance their own networks within the rural markets in which we currently provide service, which is commonly known as \u201cover-building.\u201d If our roaming customers, who generally have greater financial resources and access to capital than we do, determine to over-build our network, their need for our roaming services will be significantly reduced or eliminated.\n\u25cf\nIn Bermuda and the Caribbean, we compete primarily against Digicel, a large mobile telecommunications company in the Caribbean region, and other larger providers such as Liberty Latin America, a multinational telecommunications company.\nOver the last decade, an increase in competition in many areas of the telecommunications industry has contributed to a decline in prices for communication services, including mobile wireless services, local and long-distance telephone service and data services. Increased competition in the industry may further decrease prices. In addition, increased competition in the telecommunications and renewable energy industries could reduce our customer base, require us to invest in new facilities and capabilities and result in reduced revenues, margins and returns.\nOur International Telecom segment operates in island and other small market locations, where a limited number of providers maintain strong competition. In several of our markets, we hold a dominant position as the local incumbent carrier and in others we may have a competitive advantage in our ability to bundle some combination of voice, data, video and wireless services. Increased competition, whether from new entrants or increased capital investment by our competitors in their existing networks, will make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers in our small markets, which could result in lower revenue and cash flow from operating activities.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively execute on several key initiatives across multiple jurisdictions.\nMajor business initiatives are underway with respect to improvement in mobile and other retail sales in all markets, digitization of internal processes to allow for quicker response time to customer requirements, modernization of existing internal processes in select markets and revising the strategy of some of our US Telecom businesses to develop additional revenue streams, including the substantial construction and support undertaking of the FirstNet project. Each of these requires significant oversight from senior management to aid in-market teams, and many of these projects are underway simultaneously in different locations. Execution on multiple simultaneous and transformational initiatives will require in depth management attention in multiple jurisdictions in order to capitalize on growth in the US Virgin Islands, economic growth in Guyana and the ongoing shift in business focus in US Telecom.\nWe may not be able to effectively transform the business model of our legacy US Telecom business.\nHistorically, a large portion of our revenue has been derived from Carrier Services revenue in our US Telecom segment. A substantial portion of this revenue was generated from three national wireless service providers in 2020, however, these amounts have declined from $74.6 million in 2019 to $72.6 in 2020. During this time period, revenues from Carrier Services have declined due to our mutual agreement with our carrier customers to lower rates in exchange for pricing certainty in longer term contracts, our customers\u2019 decisions to overbuild our network, and the consolidation of national wireless service providers (thereby eliminating one or more former carrier customers).\nAs wholesale roaming revenue in our US Telecom segment has declined, we are increasingly providing network infrastructure services as part of our expanded Carrier Services, such as tower leasing and transport facilities to our carrier partners to supplement our historic revenue base, as with the FirstNet Transaction. During the construction period of the FirstNet Transaction, we will continue to receive payment from AT&T for roaming services at a fixed rate per site until such time as the cell site is transferred to AT&T. Thereafter, AT&T will cease roaming on the majority of our US network and revenue from the maintenance, leasing and transport services provided to AT&T is expected to offset such lost revenue, albeit at lower operating income margins due to the increased operating expenses associated with leasing and transport services, as compared to our wholesale mobile roaming services.\nWe also intend to offset declining wholesale roaming revenue with a more diversified mix of revenue from carrier services, including more tower rental, backhaul and maintenance services and growing enterprise broadband and\nprivate network services. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully transform our legacy US Telecom business to support additional Carrier Services product offerings or expand our retail and commercial subscriber base in our US Telecom segment. If we are unable to offset the continued decline in our Carrier Services revenue by expanding diversifying our sources of revenue it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have difficulty funding multiple growth opportunities across our businesses.\nHistorically, we have funded our capital expenditures and transactional matters from a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations, and limited incurrence of debt. As discussed above, our US Telecom segment is in the midst of a business transformation, and may need significant funding as we seek to grow our private LTE and retail businesses. Similarly, we may have other opportunities to inorganically grow our businesses, such as the Alaska Transaction, and our team actively evaluates potential acquisitions, investment opportunities and other strategic transactions, both domestic and international, that have the potential for generating steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time. Any such transactions may be accomplished through the payment of cash, issuance of shares of our capital stock or incurrence of additional debt, or a combination thereof. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $105.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments and approximately $86.9 million of long-term debt. How and when we deploy our balance sheet capacity will figure prominently in our longer-term growth prospects and stockholder returns. To support multiple simultaneous growth opportunities, we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional debt to fund our future operations or investment opportunities. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding from public or private offerings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain the requisite amount of financing, we may have to forgo opportunities to strategically grow our business.\nWe are actively evaluating investment, acquisition and other strategic opportunities, which may affect our long-term growth prospects.\nTo date we have grown the Company through a mix of organic growth through our operating companies and inorganic growth through targeting acquisition or other business development opportunities. We actively evaluate acquisition, investment, business divestitures and combinations, and other strategic opportunities, both domestic and international, in telecommunications, energy-related and other industries, including in areas that may not be seen by the broader market as timely today, such as our planned acquisition of Alaska Communications. We may focus on opportunities that we believe have potential for long-term organic and strategic growth or that may otherwise satisfy our return and other investment criteria. Similarly, there are risks inherent in the sale of a business or assets, including the potential of a transaction\u2019s failing to close due to last minute negotiations, regulatory issues, or other unpredictable matters that can be costly and disruptive to our operations. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms we will be able to invest in, acquire or divest any businesses or assets to continue our historic pattern of inorganic growth or that we will be able to successfully integrate the business or realize the perceived benefits of any acquisition or strategic investment.\nRisks Relating to our Alaska Transaction\nWe may not be able to consummate our merger with Alaska Communications on a timely basis or at all.\nOn December 31, 2020, we announced that we entered into the Alaska Merger Agreement to consummate the Alaska Transaction. The Alaska Transaction remains subject to customary closing terms and conditions including (i) the approval of Alaska Communications\u2019 stockholders, (ii) the absence of certain legal impediments, and (iii) obtaining the necessary consents from the Federal Communications Commissions and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska. Although we have received no indication that Alaska Communications stockholders or these regulatory authorities do not plan to grant the required approvals, there can be no guarantee that we will receive such approvals.\nMoreover, the board of directors of Alaska Communications may change its recommendation that stockholders approve the Alaska Transaction, and the Alaska Merger Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances if a competing offer for an alternative transaction is made, in which case the transaction would not close and termination fees\nmay be payable. Upon termination of the Alaska Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Alaska Communications a termination fee, including (i) a fee of $7,100,000 if we cannot consummate the Alaska Transaction due to lack of financing, or (ii) a fee of $8,800,000 if we fail to consummate the Alaska Transaction after all other conditions to closing are met.\nIn addition, the FCC may impose conditions on any approval, such as requiring the divestiture of certain markets and spectrum licenses. These conditions, if imposed and if sufficiently significant, may permit Alaska Communications not to consummate the transaction or may have other negative impacts on our business.\nLawsuits have been filed against us and Alaska Communications, challenging the disclosure made to Alaska Communications stockholders in connection with the solicitation of their vote in favor of the Alaska Transaction. An adverse judgment may result in financial penalties or if any plaintiff successfully seeks to enjoin the Alaska Transaction, then the combination of our business with Alaska Communications may not be consummated at all or within the expected timeframe. If the Alaska Transaction is not consummated or is materially delayed for these or any other reason, our business and operations, and our stock price, may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to finance the Alaska Transaction depends on our ability to draw upon a new credit facility.\nWe have secured committed financing, consisting of a combination of (i) equity financing to be provided by us and Freedom3 and (ii) debt financing to be provided by Fifth Third Bank, National Association, to acquire the shares of Alaska Communications. The equity financing and the debt financing, in the aggregate, will be sufficient for us to pay the amounts required to be paid in connection with the Alaska Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Alaska Merger Agreement; however, the Alaska Transaction is not subject to a financing condition. We have also entered into a limited guarantee with Alaska Communications pursuant to which we and Freedom3 will guarantee 52% and 48%, respectively, of the termination fees discussed above in connection with Alaska Communications\u2019 termination of the Alaska Merger Agreement and certain indemnity and recovery costs, if such amounts become due and payable. Our ability to consummate the Alaska Transaction relies on the continued availability of the committed debt financing, according to the terms of our term sheet with Fifth Third Bank.\nIf we are able to successfully consummate the Alaska Transaction, we may have difficulties integrating its operations and its business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Alaska Transaction is the largest and most significant acquisition we have undertaken for a number of years. The complexities of the integration and expansion of Alaska Communications\u2019 operations are not yet known. We have devoted and will continue to devote a significant amount of time and attention to integrating these operations with our existing operations teams. Among the challenges we face in doing so are the need to integrate a large number of new employees and integrating and aligning numerous business and work processes, including customer billing, by building and designing our own processes and the information systems necessary to track and handle those processes. If we have other difficulties with the transition process, it could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nChanges in USF funding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nViya, our subsidiary operating video, internet, wireless and landline services in the US Virgin Islands, has historically received, through December 31, 2020, high-cost Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) support in the US Virgin Islands of approximately $16.4 million per year. In addition, after the devastation caused by the Hurricanes in September 2017, the FCC provided approximately $15.4 million in accelerated USF support and in fixed and mobile recovery support through August 2018. The FCC, in response to the damage caused by the Hurricanes and as part of its general USF reform, established a Connect USVI Fund that replaced the legacy high-cost USF support for the US Virgin Islands that Viya historically has been awarded. In November 2020, the FCC announced that it was provisionally awarding the Connect USVI Fund awards for all of the US Virgin Islands to Viya\u2019s competitor in the amount of approximately $8.6\nmillion per year for a term of 10 years. Pursuant to the terms of the program, Viya\u2019s USF spending will be reduced, upon finalization of the award, to approximately two-thirds of the legacy total amount, or $10.9 million for one year to approximately one-third of the legacy total amount, or $5.47 million, for the year after. Thereafter, Viya will not be eligible for high-cost USF support.\nThis reduction in the overall amount of USF support we receive as a result of the Connect USVI Fund proceeding relative to historical levels of high-cost USF support we have received could negatively affect our efforts to build, maintain and operate networks in the US Virgin Islands and our ability to provide services previously supported by USF funds. Viya is currently undertaking a review and reassessment of its business plan to consider the extent to which we will provide further investment or operational resources to Viya or the territory. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in our International Telecom segment and there can be no assurance that any revised business plan will offset or reduce the loss of revenue, customer attrition and increased competition as a result of the cessation of high cost USF funding.\nOur operations in Guyana are subject to significant political and regulatory risk.\nSince 1991, pursuant to an agreement with the Government of Guyana, GTT has operated in Guyana pursuant to a license from the Government of Guyana to be the exclusive provider of domestic Fixed and international voice and data services. That license from the Government of Guyana included an initial term ending in December 2010, which was renewable at our sole option for an additional 20-year term. In November 2009, we notified the Government of Guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional 20-year term expiring in 2030. On December 15, 2010, we received correspondence from the Government of Guyana indicating that our license had been renewed until such time that new legislation was enacted to expand competition within the sector.\nOn October 5, 2020, the Prime Minister of Guyana formally implemented telecommunications legislation previously passed by the Guyana Parliament in 2016 that introduces material changes to many features of Guyana\u2019s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the intention of creating a more competitive market. At that time, we were issued a new license to provide domestic and international voice as well as data services and mobile services in Guyana. Two of our competitors, who had previously provided fixed voice and internet services on an unlicensed basis, were issued service licenses as well. While we have requested details of our competitors\u2019 licenses, such information has not been made public by the Guyana Telecommunications Agency, and we are not yet able to ascertain whether the licenses issued to our competitors permit any competitors to provide services that have been subject to GTT\u2019s exclusive rights contained in its 1990 license.\nOn October 23, 2020, the Government of Guyana also brought into effect new telecommunications regulations called for by the telecommunications legislation. The regulations include new requirements for the market as a whole, which impact our operations, administrative reporting and services. There can be no assurance that these regulations will be effectively implemented, or that they will be administered in a fair and transparent manner. We believe our existing, exclusive license continues to be valid unless and until such time as we enter into an alternative arrangement with the Government. Under these circumstances, however, there can be no assurance that our discussions with the Government of Guyana will resume or be concluded, or that such discussions will satisfactorily address our contractual exclusivity rights. While we might seek damages or other compensation for any involuntary termination of our contractual exclusivity rights, we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in any proceedings to enforce our rights.\nRegulatory changes may impose restrictions that adversely affect us or cause us to incur significant unplanned costs in modifying our business plans or operations.\nWe are subject to US federal, state and local regulations and foreign government regulations, all of which are subject to change. As new laws and regulations are issued or discontinued, we may be required to materially modify our business plans or operations. We cannot be certain that we can do so in a cost effective manner. Our operations in the United States are subject to the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s implementing regulations, as well as regulation by state public utility commissions in certain states in which we operate. The interpretation and implementation of the various provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC rules implementing the Communications Act continue to be heavily debated and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, there have been indications that Congress\nmay substantially revise the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulations in the next few years. Further, the leadership of the FCC changed in January 2021, and the FCC may pursue new and differed regulatory priorities.\nOur international operations are subject to similar regulations, the interpretation and implementation of which are also often debated, and which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our interpretations of our obligations may differ from those of regulatory authorities. Both federal and state regulators, as well as international regulators, require us to pay various fees and assessments, file periodic reports and comply with various rules regarding our consumer marketing practices and the contents of our bills, on an on-going basis. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to fines or potentially be asked to show cause as to why our licenses to provide service should not be revoked.\nThe loss of certain licenses could adversely affect our ability to provide wireless and broadband services.\nIn the United States, wireless licenses generally are valid for 10 years from the effective date of the license, although recently-issued 600 MHz licenses were issued for a slightly longer initial term to account for the need for broadcast television incumbents to vacate the spectrum before the new wireless licensees could construct. Licensees may renew their licenses (including renewal of 600 MHz licenses) for additional 10 year periods by filing renewal applications with the FCC. Our 600 MHz wireless licenses all expire in 2029. Our other wireless licenses in the US expire between 2021 and sometime after 2030. We intend to renew our licenses expiring this year, and the renewal applications are subject to FCC review and are put out for public comment to ensure that the licensees meet their licensing requirements and comply with other applicable FCC mandates. Failure to file for renewal of these licenses or failure to meet any licensing requirements could lead to a denial of the renewal application and thus adversely affect our ability to continue to provide service in that license area. Furthermore, our compliance with regulatory requirements, such as E-911 and CALEA requirements, may depend on the availability of necessary equipment or software.\nIn our international markets, telecommunications licenses are typically issued and regulated by the applicable telecommunications ministry. The application and renewal process for these licenses may be lengthy, require us to expend substantial renewal fees, and/or be subject to regulatory or legislative uncertainty, such as we are experiencing in Guyana, as described above. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses or operations and could result in sanctions, fines or other penalties.\nEconomic Risks\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in the services we sell or have a significant impact on our operating costs. Energy costs are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, or weather conditions. Rapid and significant changes in these and other commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, an economic downturn in the markets in which we currently operate or in the global market generally may lead to slower economic activity, increased unemployment, concerns about inflation, decreased consumer confidence and other adverse business conditions that could have an impact on our businesses. For example, among other things:\n\u25cf\na decrease in tourism could negatively affect revenues and growth opportunities from operations in the islands and in a number of areas covered by US rural and wholesale wireless operations that serve tourist destinations; and\n\u25cf\nan increase in \u201cbad debt,\u201d or the amounts that we have to write off of our accounts receivable could result from our inability to collect subscription fees from our subscribers.\nIn 2020 we saw a decrease in tourism in all of our tourism-dependent markets. Government imposed shutdowns and travel restrictions limited the amount of customers roaming onto our network, in addition to depressing demand for our services generally in the hospitality industry (e.g. hotels, bars, and restaurants) that is traditionally supported by the tourism industry. Further, we also started to see population flight from some of our island markets as lockdowns continued. It is unknown what the long-term economic effects of these negative impacts on the tourism industry will be, but our business operations and revenue may certainly be adversely impacted as a result.\nThe long-term impact, if any, that these events might have on us and our business, is uncertain.\nOur operations are subject to economic, political, currency and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position.\nOur operations may face adverse financial consequences and operational problems due to political or economic changes, such as changes in national or regional political or economic conditions, laws and regulations that restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As new laws and regulations are issued or discontinued to implement an agenda set by the current US administration, we may be required to materially modify our business plans or operations. For example, some of our markets in our International Telecom segment are cash-based economies where customers come into our stores to pay their bills in cash. Where local governments have imposed lockdowns requiring people to stay home and/or the closure of retail locations, we run the risk of not being able to collect monthly invoices as expected. Any of these changes could adversely affect our revenues or financial position.\nOur debt instruments include restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe credit facilities that we and our subsidiaries maintain include certain financial and other covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe such actions are in our best interest. These include restrictions on our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens or negative pledges with respect to our assets;\n\u25cf\npay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock;\n\u25cf\nmake investments, loans or advances or other forms of payments;\n\u25cf\nissue, sell or allow distributions on capital stock of specified subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates; or\n\u25cf\nmerge, consolidate or sell our assets.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities or any subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default. Such default may allow our creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, these creditors may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds.\nOther Risks\nOur founder is our largest stockholder and could exert significant influence over us.\nCornelius B. Prior, Jr., our founder and the father of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with related entities, affiliates and family members (including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), beneficially owns approximately 26% of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, he has the ability to exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions. His interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our Common Stock.\nLow trading volume of our stock may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell shares and/or result in lower sale prices.\nFor the three months prior to February 1, 2021, the average daily trading volume of our Common Stock was approximately 49,000 shares. As a result, our stockholders may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our Common Stock in the manner or at a price that might be attainable if our Common Stock were more actively traded. In addition, the market price of our Common Stock may not be reflective of its underlying value.\nWe may not pay dividends in the future.\nOur stockholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if, and when, they are declared by our Board of Directors. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends in the past, but may cease to do so or decrease the dividend amount at any time. Our credit facility sets certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, our capital stock. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that may further restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends. We may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable state laws, our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, management\u2019s assessment of future capital needs and other factors considered by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 77090, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "ATNI"}
