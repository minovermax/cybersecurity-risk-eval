{"cik": "1488139", "company": "Ameresco, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline. Our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d before deciding to invest in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf demand for our energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions does not develop as we expect, our revenues will suffer, and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe, and our growth plans assume, that the market for energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions will continue to grow, that we will increase our penetration of this market and that our revenues from selling into this market will continue to increase over time. If our expectations as to the size of this market and our ability to sell our products and services in this market are not correct, our revenues will suffer, and our business will be harmed.\nIn order to secure contracts for new projects, we typically face a long and variable selling cycle that requires significant resource commitments and requires a long lead time before we realize revenues.\nThe sales, design, and construction process for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects recently has been taking from 18 to 54 months on average, with sales to federal government and housing authority customers tending to require the longest sales processes. Our sales cycle has been further lengthened as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, cannot predict the timeline for our selling cycle in the current conditions. Our existing and potential customers generally follow extended budgeting and procurement processes, and sometimes must engage in regulatory approval processes related to our services. Our customers often use outside consultants and advisors, which contributes to a longer sales cycle. Most of our potential customers issue an RFP, as part of their consideration of alternatives for their proposed project. In preparation for responding to an RFP, we typically conduct a preliminary audit of the customer\u2019s needs and the opportunity to reduce its energy costs. For projects involving a renewable energy plant that is not located on a customer\u2019s site or that uses sources of energy not within the customer\u2019s control, the sales process also involves the identification of sites with attractive sources of renewable energy, such as a landfill or a favorable site for solar PV, and it may involve obtaining necessary rights and governmental permits to develop a project on that site. If we are awarded a project, we then perform a more detailed audit of the customer\u2019s facilities, which serves as the basis for the final specifications of the project. We then must negotiate and execute a contract with the customer. In addition, we or the customer typically need to obtain financing for the project.\nThis extended sales process requires the dedication of significant time by our sales and management personnel and our use of significant financial resources, with no certainty of success or recovery of our related expenses. A potential customer may go through the entire sales process and not accept our proposal. All of these factors can contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial performance and increase the likelihood that our operating results in a particular quarter will fall below investor expectations. These factors could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results due to increased spending by us that is not offset by increased revenues.\nWe may not recognize all revenues from our backlog or receive all payments anticipated under awarded projects and customer contracts.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had backlog of approximately $1,509.3 million and $895.7 million, respectively, in expected future revenues under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects, which we sometimes refer to as fully-contracted backlog; and we also had been awarded projects for which we do not yet have signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenues of an additional $1,542.8 million and $1,318.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had O&M backlog of approximately $1,131.7 million and $1,131.1 million, respectively. Our O&M backlog represents expected future revenues under signed multi-year customer contracts for the delivery of O&M services, primarily for energy efficiency and renewable energy construction projects completed by us for our customers.\nOur customers have the right under some circumstances to terminate contracts or defer the timing of our services and their payments to us. In addition, our government contracts are subject to the risks described below under \u201cProvisions in government contracts may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\u201d The payment estimates for projects that have been awarded to us but for which we have not yet signed contracts have been prepared by management and are based upon a number of assumptions, including that the size and scope of the awarded projects will not change prior to the signing of customer contracts, that we or our customers will be able to obtain any necessary third-party financing for the awarded projects, and that we and our customers will reach agreement on and execute contracts for the awarded projects. We are not always able to enter into a contract for an awarded project on the terms proposed. As a result, we may not receive all of the revenues that we include in the awarded projects component of our backlog or that we estimate we will receive under awarded projects. If we do not receive all of the\nrevenue we currently expect to receive, our future operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, a delay in the receipt of revenues, even if such revenues are eventually received, may cause our operating results for a particular quarter to fall below our expectations.\nWe may be unable to complete or operate our projects on a profitable basis or as we have committed to our customers.\nDevelopment, installation, and construction of our energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and operation of our renewable energy projects, entails many risks, including:\n\u2022failure to receive critical components and equipment that meet our design specifications and can be delivered on schedule,\n\u2022failure to obtain all necessary rights to land access and use,\n\u2022failure to receive quality and timely performance of third-party services,\n\u2022increases (including as a result of inflation) in the cost of labor, equipment, and commodities needed to construct or operate projects,\n\u2022permitting and other regulatory issues, license revocation, and changes in legal requirements,\n\u2022shortages of equipment or skilled labor,\n\u2022unforeseen engineering problems,\n\u2022failure of a customer to accept or pay for renewable energy that we supply,\n\u2022weather interferences, catastrophic events including fires, explosions, earthquakes, droughts, and acts of terrorism; and accidents involving personal injury or the loss of life,\n\u2022health or similar issues, a pandemic, or epidemic, such as COVID-19,\n\u2022labor disputes and work stoppages,\n\u2022mishandling of hazardous substances and waste, and other events outside of our control.\nAny of these factors could give rise to construction delays and construction and other costs in excess of our expectations. We have, for example, experienced disruptions in development, installation and construction as a result of COVID-19 and the related quarantines, facility closures, and supply chain, travel and logistics challenges, and we may continue to experience such disruptions. In addition, the impacts of climate change have caused us to experience more frequent and severe weather interferences, and this trend may continue. These factors and events could prevent us from completing construction of our projects, cause defaults under our financing agreements or under contracts that require completion of project construction by a certain time, cause projects to be unprofitable for us, or otherwise impair our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA significant decline in the fiscal health of federal, state, provincial, and local governments could reduce demand for our energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.\nHistorically, including for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, more than 67% of our revenues have been derived from sales to federal, state, provincial, or local governmental entities, including public housing authorities and public universities. We expect revenues from this market sector to continue to comprise a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. A significant decline in the fiscal health of these existing and potential customers may make it difficult for them to enter into contracts for our services or to obtain financing necessary to fund such contracts, or may cause them to seek to renegotiate or terminate existing agreements with us. In addition, if there is a partial or full shutdown of any federal, state, provincial or local governing body this may adversely impact our financial performance.\nProvisions in our government contracts may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA significant majority of our fully-contracted backlog and awarded projects is attributable to customers that are governmental entities. Our contracts with the federal government and its agencies, and with state, provincial, and local governments, customarily contain provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to:\n\u2022terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason,\n\u2022reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts,\n\u2022decline to award future contracts if actual or apparent organizational conflicts of interest are discovered, or to impose organizational conflict mitigation measures as a condition of eligibility for an award,\n\u2022suspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency, and\n\u2022pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act, and similar remedy provisions unique to government contracting.\nUnder general principles of government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to the\ntermination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. In most of our contracts with the federal government, the government has agreed to make a payment to us in the event that it terminates the agreement early. The termination payment is designed to compensate us for the cost of construction plus financing costs and profit on the work completed.\nIn ESPCs for governmental entities, the methodologies for computing energy savings may be less favorable than for non-governmental customers and may be modified during the contract period. We may be liable for price reductions if the projected savings cannot be substantiated. In addition to the right of the federal government to terminate its contracts with us, federal government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending to honor such contracts. Congress often appropriates funds for a program on a September 30 fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of many major Governmental programs, contracts often may not be fully funded, and additional monies are then committed to the contract only if, as and when appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Similar practices are likely to also affect the availability of funding for our contracts with Canadian, as well as state, provincial, and local government entities. If one or more of our government contracts were terminated or reduced, or if appropriations for the funding of one or more of our contracts is delayed or terminated, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe projects we undertake for our customers generally require significant capital, which our customers or we may finance through third parties, and such financing may not be available to our customers or to us on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur projects for customers are typically financed by third parties. For small-scale renewable energy plants that we own, as well as certain larger projects for customers, such as the battery storage project with SCE, we typically rely on a combination of our working capital and debt to finance construction costs. If we or our customers are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms when needed or if we do not have sufficient working capital or availability under our existing financing arrangements, we may be unable to secure customer contracts, the size of contracts we do obtain may be smaller or we could be required to delay the development and construction of projects, reduce the scope of those projects or otherwise restrict our operations. Delays in customer projects could also subject us to claims by customers. The terms of financing arrangements that we may enter into, including increases in interest rates as compared to historical rates, could impact the profitability of our projects. Furthermore, any inability by us or our customers to raise the funds necessary to finance our projects or construction costs could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe loss of Southern California Edison Company (\u201cSCE\u201d), which is one of our most significant customers, or our failure to perform on our contract with that customer in accordance with its terms could adversely affect us.\nWe expect that a material portion of our revenue for 2022 will be generated from our design and build of battery energy storage system facilities for SCE under our Turnkey Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Maintenance Agreement and the underlying purchase orders dated as of October 21, 2021 (the \u201cSCE Agreement\u201d) with SCE. The SCE Agreement and related purchase orders obligate us to achieve certain substantial completion milestone dates (as they may be extended) for the facilities no later than August 1, 2022, and for at least two years thereafter meet specified availability and capacity guarantees. The SCE Agreement also requires us to expend significant capital, and if we are unable to fund such capital needs on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, this could adversely impact the construction timeline under the agreement. If we fail to satisfy these milestone obligations or fail to meet the availability and capacity guarantees, we may be subject to liquidated damages and under certain circumstances SCE may have a right to terminate the agreement. The requirement to pay liquidated damages or the loss of business from SCE could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business or results of operations.\nProject development or construction activities may not be successful, and we may make significant investments without first obtaining project financing, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments.\nThe development and construction of small-scale renewable energy plants and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being built. In addition, we will often choose to bear the costs of such efforts prior to obtaining project financing, prior to getting final regulatory approval and prior to our final sale to a customer, if any.\nSuccessful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including: failures or delays in obtaining desired or necessary land rights, including ownership, leases and/or easements; failures or delays in obtaining necessary permits, licenses, or other governmental support or approvals, or in overcoming objections from members of the public or adjoining land owners; uncertainties relating to land costs for projects; unforeseen engineering problems; access to available transmission for electricity generated by our small-scale renewable energy plants; construction delays and contractor performance\nshortfalls; work stoppages or labor disruptions and compliance with labor regulations; cost over-runs; availability of products and components from suppliers; adverse weather conditions; environmental, archaeological and geological conditions; and availability of construction and permanent financing.\nIf we are unable to complete the development of a small-scale renewable energy plants or fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates, we may be subject to liquidated damages and/or penalties under the Engineering Procurement and Construction agreement or other agreements relating to the power plant or project, and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project. We expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects whether owned by us or by third parties. If we are unable to complete the development of a project, we may write-down or write-off some or all of these capitalized investments, which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers.\nMost of our revenues are derived under multi-year or long-term contracts with our customers, and our revenues are therefore dependent to a large extent on the creditworthiness of our customers. During periods of economic downturn, our exposure to credit risks from our customers\u2019 increases, and our efforts to monitor and mitigate the associated risks may not be effective in reducing our credit risks. Our reliance on one or a few customers for a material portion of our revenue further exacerbates this risk. In the event of non-payment by one or more of our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles, and these trends and cycles could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months, such as the northern United States and Canada, and climates that experience extreme weather events, such as wildfires, storms, or flooding, or at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied. In addition, government customers, many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours, typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Further, government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of, and delays in, the legislative process related to government programs and incentives that help drive demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. As a result, our revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarter are typically higher, and our revenues and operating income in the first quarter are typically lower, than in other quarters of the year. As a result of such fluctuations, we may occasionally experience declines in revenue or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.\nFailure of third parties to manufacture quality products or provide reliable services in a timely manner could cause delays in the delivery of our services and completion of our projects, which could damage our reputation, have a negative impact on our relationships with our customers and adversely affect our growth.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide services and complete projects in a timely manner, which in part depends on the ability of third parties to provide us with timely and reliable products and services. In providing our services and completing our projects, we rely on products that meet our design specifications and components manufactured and supplied by third parties, as well as on services performed by subcontractors. We also rely on subcontractors to perform substantially all of the construction and installation work related to our projects; and we often need to engage subcontractors with whom we have no experience for our projects. We, our subcontractors and other third parties have been impacted by the global supply chain delays as well as quarantine and other restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in and may continue to result in delays in our ability to provide our services and complete our projects in a timely manner. In addition, some of the third parties we engage for our design, construction and operation projects operate internationally and our reliance on their products and services may be impacted by economic, political, and labor conditions in those regions as well as the uncertainty caused by the evolving relations between the United States and these regions, including China.\nIf any of our subcontractors are unable to provide services that meet or exceed our customers\u2019 expectations or satisfy our contractual commitments, our reputation, business and operating results could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to avail ourselves of warranty and other contractual protections with providers of products and services, we may incur liability to our customers or additional costs related to the affected products and components, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, any delays, malfunctions, inefficiencies, or interruptions in these products or services could adversely affect the quality and performance of our solutions and require considerable expense to establish alternate sources for such products and services. This could cause us to experience difficulty retaining current customers and attracting new customers, and could harm our brand, reputation, and growth.\nWe may have liability to our customers under our ESPCs if our projects fail to deliver the energy use reductions to which we are committed under the contract.\nFor our energy efficiency projects, we typically enter into ESPCs under which we commit that the projects will satisfy agreed-upon performance standards appropriate to the project. These commitments are typically structured as guarantees of increased energy efficiency that are based on the design, capacity, efficiency, or operation of the specific equipment and systems we install. Our commitments generally fall into three categories: pre-agreed, equipment-level and whole building-level. Under a pre-agreed efficiency commitment, our customer reviews the project design in advance and agrees that, upon or shortly after completion of installation of the specified equipment comprising the project, the pre-agreed increase in energy efficiency will have been met. Under an equipment-level commitment, we commit to a level of increased energy efficiency based on the difference in use measured first with the existing equipment and then with the replacement equipment upon completion of installation. A whole building-level commitment requires future measurement and verification of increased energy efficiency for a whole building, often based on readings of the utility meter where usage is measured. Depending on the project, the measurement and verification may be required only once, upon installation, based on an analysis of one or more sample installations, or may be required to be repeated at agreed upon intervals generally over periods of up to 25 years.\nUnder our contracts, we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations. These factors include variations in energy prices and utility rates, weather, facility occupancy schedules, the amount of energy-using equipment in a facility, and failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly. We rely in part on warranties from our equipment suppliers and subcontractors to back-stop the warranties we provide to our customers and, where appropriate, pass on the warranties to our customers. However, the warranties we provide to our customers are sometimes broader in scope or longer in duration than the corresponding warranties we receive from our suppliers and subcontractors, and we bear the risk for any differences, as well as the risk of warranty default by our suppliers and subcontractors.\nTypically, our performance commitments apply to the aggregate overall performance of a project rather than to individual energy efficiency measures. Therefore, to the extent an individual measure underperforms, it may be offset by other measures that overperform during the same period. In the event that an energy efficiency project does not perform according to the agreed-upon specifications, our agreements typically allow us to satisfy our obligation by adjusting or modifying the installed equipment, installing additional measures to provide substitute energy savings, or paying the customer for lost energy savings based on the assumed conditions specified in the agreement. However, we may incur additional or increased liabilities or expenses under our ESPCs in the future. Such liabilities or expenses could be substantial, and they could materially harm our business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, any disputes with a customer over the extent to which we bear responsibility to improve performance or make payments to the customer may diminish our prospects for future business from that customer or damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe may assume responsibility under customer contracts for factors outside our control, including, in connection with some customer projects, the risk that fuel prices will increase.\nWe typically do not take responsibility under our contracts for a wide variety of factors outside our control. We have, however, in a limited number of contracts assumed some level of risk and responsibility for certain factors - sometimes only to the extent that variations exceed specified thresholds - and may also do so under certain contracts in the future, particularly in our contracts for renewable energy projects. For example, under a contract for the construction and operation of a cogeneration facility at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a subsidiary of ours is exposed to the risk that the price of the biomass that will be used to fuel the cogeneration facility may rise during the 19-year performance period of the contract. Several provisions in that contract mitigate the price risk. In addition, although we typically structure our contracts so that our obligation to supply a customer with biogas, electricity or steam, for example, does not exceed the quantity produced by the production facility, in some circumstances we may commit to supply a customer with specified minimum quantities based on our projections of the facility\u2019s production capacity. In such circumstances, if we are unable to meet such commitments, we may be required to incur additional costs or face penalties. Despite the steps we have taken to mitigate risks under these and other contracts, such steps may not be sufficient to avoid the need to incur increased costs to satisfy our commitments, and such costs could be material. Increased costs that we are unable to pass through to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business depends on experienced and skilled personnel and substantial specialty subcontractor resources, and if we lose key personnel or if we are unable to attract and integrate additional skilled personnel, it will be more difficult for us to manage our business and complete projects.\nThe success of our business and construction projects depends in large part on the skill of our personnel and on trade labor resources, including with certain specialty subcontractor skills. Competition for personnel, particularly those with expertise in the\nenergy services and renewable energy industries, is high. In the event we are unable to attract, hire and retain the requisite personnel and subcontractors, we may experience delays in completing projects in accordance with project schedules and budgets. Further, any increase in demand for personnel and specialty subcontractors may result in higher costs, causing us to exceed the budget on a project. Either of these circumstances may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results, harm our reputation among and relationships with our customers and cause us to curtail our pursuit of new projects.\nOur future success is particularly dependent on the vision, skills, experience, and effort of our senior management team, including our executive officers and our founder, principal stockholder, president, and chief executive officer, George P. Sakellaris. If we were to lose the services of any of our executive officers or key employees, our ability to effectively manage our operations and implement our strategy could be harmed and our business may suffer.\nIf we cannot obtain surety bonds and letters of credit, our ability to operate may be restricted.\nFederal and state laws require us to secure the performance of certain long-term obligations through surety bonds and letters of credit. In addition, we are occasionally required to provide bid bonds or performance bonds to secure our performance under energy efficiency contracts. In the future, we may have difficulty procuring or maintaining surety bonds or letters of credit, and obtaining them may become more expensive, require us to post cash collateral or otherwise involve unfavorable terms. Because we are sometimes required to have performance bonds or letters of credit in place before projects can commence or continue, our failure to obtain or maintain those bonds and letters of credit would adversely affect our ability to begin and complete projects, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than we do, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, growth rates, and market share.\nOur industry is highly competitive, with many companies of varying size and business models, many of which have their own proprietary technologies, competing for the same business as we do. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than us and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competitive advantage. Our competitors may also offer energy solutions at prices below cost, devote significant sales forces to competing with us or attempt to recruit our key personnel by increasing compensation, any of which could improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete, and reduce our market share and revenues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete against our current competitors or additional companies that may enter our markets. In addition, we may also face competition based on technological developments that reduce demand for electricity, increase power supplies through existing infrastructure or otherwise compete with our products and services. We also encounter competition in the form of potential customers electing to develop solutions or perform services internally rather than engaging an outside provider such as us.\nOur small-scale renewable energy plants may not generate expected levels of output.\nThe small-scale renewable energy plants that we construct and own are subject to various operating risks that may cause them to generate less than expected amounts of processed biogas, electricity, or thermal energy. These risks include a failure or degradation of our, our customers\u2019 or utilities\u2019 equipment; an inability to find suitable replacement equipment or parts; less than expected supply of the plant\u2019s source of renewable energy, such as biogas or biomass; or a faster than expected diminishment of such supply. Any extended interruption in the plant\u2019s operation, or failure of the plant for any reason to generate the expected amount of output, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we have in the past, and could in the future, incur material asset impairment charges if any of our renewable energy plants incur operational issues that indicate that our expected future cash flows from the plant are less than its carrying value. Any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the charge is recorded.\nWe have not entered into long-term offtake agreements for a portion of the output from our small-scale renewable energy plants and a portion of the related renewable identification numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d) are not subject to long term contracts.\nWe have not entered into long-term offtake agreements for a portion of the output from our small-scale renewable energy plants, particularly RNG and non-RNG plants, and we may sell portions of the processed RNG, medium-BTU gas or electricity produced by the facility at wholesale prices, which are exposed to market fluctuations and risks. Similarly, we have not entered into long-term agreements with respect to the RINs for which the production and sale of such biofuel may qualify. The failure to sell such processed RNG, medium-BTU gas, electricity, or the related RINs at a favorable price, or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe may not be able to replace expiring offtake agreements with contracts on similar terms. If we are unable to replace an expired offtake agreement with an acceptable new contract, we may be required to remove the small-scale renewable energy plant from the site or, alternatively, we may sell the assets to the customer.\nWe may not be able to replace an expiring offtake agreement with a contract on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. If we are unable to replace an expiring offtake agreement with an acceptable new revenue contract, the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations or we may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices which are exposed to market fluctuations and risks. In the case of a solar photovoltaic installation that ceases operations, the offtake agreement terms generally require that we remove the assets, including fixing or reimbursing the site owner for any damages caused by the assets or the removal of such assets. Alternatively, we may agree to sell the assets to the site owner, but the terms and conditions, including price, that we would receive in any sale, and the sale price may not be sufficient to replace the revenue previously generated by the small-scale renewable energy plant.\nWe plan to expand our business in part through future acquisitions and joint ventures, but we may not be able to identify or complete suitable acquisitions.\nHistorically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We plan to continue to use acquisitions of companies or assets and co-investments with third parties using joint ventures to expand our project skill-sets and capabilities, expand our geographic markets, add experienced management, increase our product and service offerings and add to our energy producing asset portfolio. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates or partners, reach agreement with targets on acceptable terms or arrange required financing for acquisitions or joint ventures on acceptable terms. In addition, the time and effort involved in identifying acquisition or joint venture candidates and consummate transactions may divert the attention and efforts of members of our management from the operations of our company.\nWe may be required to write-off or impair capitalized costs or intangible assets in the future, or we may incur restructuring costs or other charges, each of which could harm our earnings.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to our acquisitions, pending acquisitions, project development costs, interest costs related to project financing and certain energy assets. In addition, we have considerable unamortized assets. From time to time in future periods, we may be required to incur a charge against earnings in an amount equal to any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances, net of any portion thereof that we estimate will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise, relating to: (i) any operation or other asset that is being sold, permanently shut down, impaired or has not generated or is not expected to generate sufficient cash flow; (ii) any pending acquisition that is not consummated; (iii) any project that is not expected to be successfully completed; and (iv) any goodwill or other intangible assets that are determined to be impaired.\nIn response to such charges and costs and other market factors, we may be required to implement restructuring plans in an effort to reduce the size and cost of our operations and to better match our resources with our market opportunities. As a result of such actions, we would expect to incur restructuring expenses and accounting charges which may be material. Several factors could cause a restructuring to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These include potential disruption of our operations, the development of our small-scale renewable energy projects and other aspects of our business. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer and result in unintended employee attrition. Any restructuring would require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work. Moreover, we could encounter delays in executing any restructuring plans, which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense. See also Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 5, \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\u201d, to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Report.\nAny future acquisitions that we may make could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, financial condition or operating results, and our use of joint ventures could expose us to additional risks and liabilities.\nIf we are successful in consummating acquisitions, those acquisitions could subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022the purchase price we pay could significantly deplete our cash reserves or result in dilution to our existing stockholders,\n\u2022we may find that the acquired company or assets do not improve our customer offerings or market position as planned,\n\u2022we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company,\n\u2022key personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition,\n\u2022we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting,\n\u2022we may incur additional costs and expenses related to complying with additional laws, rules or regulations in new jurisdictions,\n\u2022we may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities (including for environmental-related costs) as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence or adequately adjust for in our acquisition arrangements,\n\u2022our ongoing business and management\u2019s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises,\n\u2022we may incur one-time write-offs or restructuring charges in connection with the acquisition,\n\u2022we may acquire goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to amortization or impairment tests, which could result in future charges to earnings, and\n\u2022we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated.\nFurthermore, the use of joint ventures can result in additional risks as a result of our holding non-controlling interests in or having shared responsibility for managing the affairs of the joint venture. For example, our joint venture partners may have economic and business interests that are inconsistent with ours, we may lack sole decision-making authority, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners could subject us to litigation and increased expenses. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nInternational expansion is one of our growth strategies, and international operations will expose us to additional risks that we do not face in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues from operations outside of the United States, mainly in Canada and the United Kingdom. International expansion is one of our growth strategies, and we expect our revenues and operations outside of the United States will expand in the future. These operations will be subject to a variety of risks that we do not face in the United States, and that we may face only to a limited degree in Canada and the United Kingdom, including:\n\u2022building and managing a highly experienced foreign workforce and overseeing and ensuring the performance of foreign subcontractors,\n\u2022increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations,\n\u2022additional withholding taxes or other taxes on our foreign income, and tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment,\n\u2022imposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements, many of which differ from those in the United States,\n\u2022increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk,\n\u2022longer payment cycles for sales in some foreign countries and potential difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable,\n\u2022difficulties in repatriating overseas earnings,\n\u2022international and regional economic, political and labor conditions in the countries in which we operate, including the uncertainty caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union (Brexit) on January 31, 2020 and the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom signed on December 30, 2020, and the uncertainty caused by the evolving relations between the United States and China; and\n\u2022political unrest, war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, or responses to such events, including fluctuations in the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions on business activity which may vary significantly by region.\nOur overall success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social, and political conditions. We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales, and increase our costs, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed.\nRisks related to Regulations or Governmental Actions\nOur business depends in part on federal, state, provincial and local government support for energy efficiency and renewable energy, and a decline in such support could harm our business.\nWe depend in part on legislation and government policies that support energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that enhance the economic feasibility of our energy efficiency services and small-scale renewable energy projects. This support includes legislation and regulations that authorize and regulate the manner in which certain governmental entities do business with us; encourage or subsidize governmental procurement of our services; encourage or in some cases require other customers to procure power from renewable or low-emission sources, to reduce their electricity use or otherwise to procure our services; and\nprovide us with tax and other incentives that reduce our costs or increase our revenues. Without this support, on which projects frequently rely for economic feasibility, our ability to complete projects for existing customers and obtain project commitments from new customers could be adversely affected. Due to the uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, we cannot determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our products and operations.\nA substantial portion of our earnings are derived from the sale of renewable energy certificates (\u201cRECs\u201d) and other environmental attributes, and our failure to be able to sell such attributes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nA substantial portion of our earnings are attributable to our sale of renewable energy certificates (\u201cRECs\u201d) and other environmental attributes generated by our energy assets. These attributes are used as compliance purposes for state-specific or U.S. federal policy.\nWe own and operate solar PV installations which derive a significant portion of their revenues from the sale of solar renewable energy certificates (\u201cSRECs\u201d), which are produced as a result of generating electricity. The value of these SRECs is determined by the supply and demand of SRECs in the states in which the solar PV installations are installed. Supply is driven by the amount of installations and demand is driven by state-specific laws relating to renewable portfolio standards.\nWe also own and operate renewable natural gas plants that may deliver biofuels into to the nation\u2019s natural gas pipeline grid. Such biofuel may qualify for certain environmental attribute mechanisms, such as RINs which are used for compliance purposes under the Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) program. The RFS is a U.S. federal policy that requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) administers the RFS program and may periodically undertake regulatory action involving the RFS, including annual volume standards for renewable fuel. Some of our biofuel may also qualify for various state incentives, such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\u201cLCFS\u201d), the pricing or availability of which may fluctuate.\nWe sometimes seek to sell forward a portion of our SRECs and other environmental attributes under contracts to fix the revenues from those attributes for financing purposes or hedge against future declines in prices of such environmental attributes. If our renewable energy facilities do not generate the amount of renewable energy attributes sold under such forward contracts or if for any reason the renewable energy we generate does not produce SRECs or other environmental attributes for a particular state, we may be required to make up the shortfall of SRECs or other environmental attributes under such forward contracts through purchases on the open market or make payments of liquidated damages. RECs are created through state law requirements for utilities to purchase a portion of their energy from renewable energy sources and changes in state laws or regulation relating to RECs may adversely affect the availability of RECs or other environmental attributes and the future prices for RECs or other environmental attributes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations, particularly changes in tax incentives in support of energy efficiency. For example, certain deductions relating to energy efficiency have expiration dates which could significantly alter the existing tax code, including the removal of these credits prior to their scheduled expiration. The 30% investment tax credit (\u201cITC\u201d) relating to the installation of solar power fell to 26% in 2020 which will be retained for solar projects that begin construction through the end of 2022. It will decrease to 22% in 2023 and 10% in 2024 and future years. We took advantage of the Safe Harbor commence-construction provisions contained in IRS Notice 2018-59 by pre-purchasing solar equipment in 2019 thereby preserving the ability to take 30% ITC for projects placed in service before 2024. If these or other deductions and credits expire without being extended, or otherwise are reduced or eliminated, our effective tax rate would increase, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur tax rate has historically been significantly impacted by the IRC Section 179D deduction. This deduction is related to energy efficient improvements we provide under government contracts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 made permanent the Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Building Deduction. That Act made changes to the way the deduction is calculated. If those changes result in lower levels of energy efficiency improvements, it could impact the deduction available and the tax rate.\nIn addition, like other companies, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities; our U.S. federal tax returns for 2018 through 2021 are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Though we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our net income.\nChanges in the laws and regulations governing the public procurement of ESPCs could have a material impact on our business.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from ESPCs with our government customers. While federal, state and local government rules governing such contracts vary, such rules may, for example, permit the funding of such projects through long-term financing arrangements; permit long-term payback periods from the savings realized through such contracts; allow units of government to exclude debt related to such projects from the calculation of their statutory debt limitation; allow for award of contracts on a \u201cbest value\u201d instead of \u201clowest cost\u201d basis; and allow for the use of sole source providers. To the extent these rules become more restrictive in the future, our business could be harmed.\nWe need governmental approvals and permits, and we typically must meet specified qualifications, in order to undertake our energy efficiency projects and construct, own and operate our small-scale renewable energy projects, and any failure to do so would harm our business.\nThe design, construction, and operation of our energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy projects require various governmental approvals and permits and may be subject to the imposition of related conditions that vary by jurisdiction. In some cases, these approvals and permits require periodic renewal. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether the conditions associated with the permits will be achievable. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of impractical conditions would impair our ability to develop the project. In addition, we cannot predict whether the permits will attract significant opposition or whether the permitting process will be lengthened due to complexities and appeals. Delay in the review and permitting process for a project can impair or delay our ability to develop that project or increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us. We have experienced delays in developing our projects due to delays in obtaining permits and may experience delays in the future. If we were to commence construction in anticipation of obtaining the final, non-appealable permits needed for that project, we would be subject to the risk of being unable to complete the project if all the permits were not obtained. If this were to occur, we would likely lose a significant portion of our investment in the project and could incur a loss as a result. Further, the continued operations of our projects require continuous compliance with permit conditions. This compliance may require capital improvements or result in reduced operations. Any failure to procure, maintain and comply with necessary permits would adversely affect ongoing development, construction and continuing operation of our projects.\nIn addition, the projects we perform for governmental agencies are governed by particular qualification and contracting regimes. Certain states require qualification with an appropriate state agency as a precondition to performing work or appearing as a qualified energy service provider for state, county, and local agencies within the state. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the states of Colorado and Washington pre-qualify energy service providers and provide contract documents that serve as the starting point for negotiations with potential governmental clients. Most of the work that we perform for the federal government is performed under IDIQ agreements between a government agency and us or a subsidiary. These IDIQ agreements allow us to contract with the relevant agencies to implement energy projects, but no work may be performed unless we and the agency agree on a task order or delivery order governing the provision of a specific project. The government agencies enter into contracts for specific projects on a competitive basis. We and our subsidiaries and affiliates are currently party to an IDIQ agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy expiring in 2026. We are also party to similar agreements with other federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. General Services Administration. If we are unable to maintain or renew our IDIQ qualification under the U.S. Department of Energy program for ESPCs, or similar federal or state qualification regimes, our business could be materially harmed.\nMany of our small-scale renewable energy projects are, and other future projects may be, subject to or affected by U.S. federal energy regulation or other regulations that govern the operation, ownership, and sale of the facility, or the sale of electricity from the facility.\nPUHCA and the FPA regulate public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries and place constraints on the conduct of their business. The FPA regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Under PURPA, all of our current small-scale renewable energy projects are small power \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (facilities meeting statutory size, fuel, and filing requirements) that are exempt from regulations under PUHCA, most provisions of the FPA and state rate and financial regulation. None of our renewable energy projects are currently subject to rate regulation for wholesale power sales by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) under the FPA, but certain of our projects that are under construction or development could become subject to such regulation in the future. Also, we may acquire interests in or develop generating projects that are not qualifying facilities. Non-qualifying facility projects would be fully subject to FERC corporate and rate regulation, and would be required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of energy, capacity, and ancillary services, which requires substantial disclosures to and discretionary approvals from FERC. FERC may revoke or revise an entity\u2019s authorization to make wholesale sales at negotiated, or market-based, rates if FERC determines that we can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions\nor market manipulation. In addition, many public utilities (including any non-qualifying facility generator in which we may invest) are subject to FERC reporting requirements that impose administrative burdens and that, if violated, can expose the company to civil penalties or other risks.\nAll of our wholesale electric power sales are subject to certain market behavior rules. These rules change from time to time, by virtue of FERC rulemaking proceedings and FERC-ordered amendments to utilities\u2019 or power pools\u2019 FERC tariffs. If we are deemed to have violated these rules, we will be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of our market-based rate authority, as well as potential criminal and civil penalties. If we were to lose market-based rate authority for any non-qualifying facility project we may acquire or develop in the future, we would be required to obtain FERC\u2019s acceptance of a cost-based rate schedule and could become subject to, among other things, the burdensome accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates we charge for power from our projects and our cost of regulatory compliance. Wholesale electric power sales are subject to increasing regulation. The terms and conditions for power sales, and the right to enter and remain in the wholesale electric sector, are subject to FERC oversight. Due to major regulatory restructuring initiatives at the federal and state levels, the U.S. electric industry has undergone substantial changes over the past decade. We cannot predict the future design of wholesale power markets, or the ultimate effect ongoing regulatory changes will have on our business. Other proposals to further regulate the sector may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the movement towards competitive markets.\nIf we become subject to additional regulation under PUHCA, FPA, or other regulatory frameworks, if existing regulatory requirements become more onerous, or if other material changes to the regulation of the electric power markets take place, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nChanges in utility regulation and tariffs could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is affected by regulations and tariffs that govern the activities and rates of utilities. For example, utility companies are commonly allowed by regulatory authorities to charge fees to some business customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. These fees could increase the cost to our customers of taking advantage of our services and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our current generating projects are all operated as qualifying facilities. FERC regulations under the FPA confer upon these facilities key rights to interconnection with local utilities and can entitle qualifying facilities to enter into power purchase agreements with local utilities, from which the qualifying facilities benefit. Changes to these federal laws and regulations could increase our regulatory burdens and costs and could reduce our revenues. State regulatory agencies could award renewable energy certificates or credits that our electric generation facilities produce to our power purchasers, thereby reducing the power sales revenues we otherwise would earn. In addition, modifications to the pricing policies of utilities could require renewable energy systems to charge lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid and may reduce the economic attractiveness of certain energy efficiency measures.\nSome of the demand-reduction services we provide for utilities and institutional clients are subject to regulatory tariffs imposed under federal and state utility laws. In addition, the operation of, and electrical interconnection for, our renewable energy projects are subject to federal, state, or provincial interconnection and federal reliability standards that are also set forth in utility tariffs. These tariffs specify rules, business practices, and economic terms to which we are subject. The tariffs are drafted by the utilities and approved by the utilities\u2019 state and federal regulatory commissions. These tariffs change frequently, and it is possible that future changes will increase our administrative burden or adversely affect the terms and conditions under which we render service to our customers.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s investigation into our revenue recognition and compensation practices in our software-as-a-service businesses could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, investment in remediation of our internal controls, sanctions, or penalties, distraction of our management, and litigation from third parties, each of which could adversely affect or cause variability in our financial results.\nWe are cooperating with requests by the staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for information with respect to revenue recognition for our software-as-a-service businesses during the period beginning January 1, 2014 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is overseeing a review by our outside counsel of our software-as-a-service revenue recognition, including review procedures with respect to the revenue recognized during the period from 2018 to September 30, 2020. Although, our review to date has not identified material misstatements of our financial results, the SEC\u2019s inquiry is not complete, and there can be no assurance that SEC will not reach a contrary conclusion. In that event, we may be required to restate previously filed financial statements and invest in remediation of our internal controls; the SEC or another regulator could make further inquiries or pursue further action that could result in significant costs, expenses, sanctions, and penalties; we may be subject to litigation from shareholders; and our management may be distracted by these circumstances.\nCompliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our operating results.\nCosts of compliance with federal, state, provincial, local and other foreign existing and future environmental regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. We are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in connection with energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. In addition, we may become subject to additional legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and we may incur significant additional costs to comply with existing and new requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, damages, and fines. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our projects, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations, including those intended to combat climate change, could occur. These factors may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our projects into compliance and impose additional expense on our operations. In addition, private lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal, state, provincial, and/or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs. Certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Such liability is not limited to the cleanup of contamination we actually caused. Although we seek to obtain indemnities against liabilities relating to historical contamination at the facilities we own or operate, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liability relating to the remediation of contamination, including contamination we did not cause. We may not be able to obtain or maintain, from time to time, all required environmental regulatory approvals. A delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or failure to obtain and comply with them could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur activities and operations are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations, and if we violate such regulations, we could face penalties and fines.\nWe are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals and implement health and safety programs and procedures to control risks associated with our projects. Compliance with those laws and regulations can require us to incur substantial costs. Moreover, if our compliance programs are not successful, we could be subject to penalties or to revocation of our permits, which may require us to curtail or cease operations of the affected projects. Violations of laws, regulations and permit requirements may also result in criminal sanctions or injunctions. Health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements may change or become more stringent. Any such changes could require us to incur materially higher costs than we currently have. Our costs of complying with current and future health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements, and any liabilities, fines or other sanctions resulting from violations of them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.\nOur privacy policy is posted on our website, and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal, state, or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. We may also incur substantial expenses and costs in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws. Globally, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in Europe and new and emerging state laws in the United States on privacy, data, and related technologies, have created new compliance obligations and significantly increases fines for noncompliance. Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers\u2019 personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our services, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur senior credit facility, project financing term loans and construction loans contain financial and operating restrictions that may limit our business activities and our access to credit and they may not be sufficient to fund our capital needs and growth.\nProvisions in our senior credit facility and term loan, project financing term loans and construction loans impose customary restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 business activities and uses of cash and other collateral. These agreements also contain other customary covenants, including covenants that require us to meet specified financial ratios and financial tests.\nWe have a $180 million revolving senior secured credit facility and $65 million term loan that mature June 2024 (collectively, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d), which are subject to the quarter end ratio covenant described below as well as certain other customary\noperational covenants. As of December 31, 2021, the balance of our Senior Credit Facilities were $97.8 million. These Senior Credit Facilities may not be sufficient to meet our needs as our business grows, and we may be unable to extend or replace them on acceptable terms, or at all. Under these facilities, we are required to maintain a maximum ratio of total funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1.0. We are also required to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the agreements) of at least 1.5 to 1.0. EBITDA for purposes of the facilities excludes the results of certain renewable energy projects that we own and for which financing from others remains outstanding.\nIn addition, our project financing term loans and construction loans require us to comply with a variety of financial and operational covenants. Although we do not consider it likely that we will fail to comply with any material covenants for the next twelve months, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default and cause us to be unable to borrow under our Senior Credit Facilities. In addition to preventing additional borrowings under these facilities, an event of default, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under it or the applicable project financing term loan, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. Certain of our debt agreements, including our Senior Credit Facilities, also contain subjective acceleration clauses based on a lender deeming that a \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d in our business has occurred. If these clauses are implicated, and the lender declares that an event of default has occurred, the outstanding indebtedness would likely be immediately due and owing. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIf our subsidiaries default on their obligations under their debt instruments, we may need to make payments to lenders to prevent foreclosure on the collateral securing the debt.\nWe typically set up subsidiaries to own and finance our renewable energy projects. These subsidiaries incur various types of debt which can be used to finance one or more projects. This debt is typically structured as non-recourse debt, which means it is repayable solely from the revenues from the projects financed by the debt and is secured by such projects\u2019 physical assets, major contracts and cash accounts and a pledge of our equity interests in the subsidiaries involved in the projects. Although our subsidiary debt is typically non-recourse to Ameresco, if a subsidiary of ours defaults on such obligations, or if one project out of several financed by a particular subsidiary\u2019s indebtedness encounters difficulties or is terminated, then we may from time to time determine to provide financial support to the subsidiary in order to maintain rights to the project or otherwise avoid the adverse consequences of a default. In the event a subsidiary defaults on its indebtedness, its creditors may foreclose on the collateral securing the indebtedness, which may result in our losing our ownership interest in some or all of the subsidiary\u2019s assets. The loss of our ownership interest in a subsidiary or some or all of a subsidiary\u2019s assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe LIBOR calculation method under certain of our financing arrangements may change as LIBOR is expected to be phased out by June 2023.\nOur senior credit facility and certain of our project financing term loans permit or require interest on the outstanding principal balance to be calculated based on LIBOR. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced in 2017 that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This date has been extended to June 30, 2023. As a result, actions by the FCA, other regulators, or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock is volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations, some of which are beyond our control. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our Class A common stock has traded at a low of $37.70 and a high of $101.86. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies. If the stock market in general experiences a significant decline, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or operating results. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your Class A common stock at or above the price you paid for it, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Additionally, although historically there has not been a large short position in our Class A common stock, securities of certain companies have recently experienced extreme and significant volatility as a result of a large aggregate short position driving up the stock price over a short period of time, which is known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d Furthermore, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class actions filed against them. If a suit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it would likely result\nin substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nHolders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to five votes per share. The lower voting power of our Class A common stock may negatively affect the attractiveness of our Class A common stock to investors and, as a result, its market value.\nWe have two classes of common stock: Class A common stock, which is listed on the NYSE and which is entitled to one vote per share, and Class B common stock, which is not listed on any security exchange and is entitled to five votes per share. The difference in the voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock could diminish the market value of our Class A common stock because of the superior voting rights of our Class B common stock and the power those rights confer.\nFor the foreseeable future, Mr. Sakellaris or his affiliates will be able to control the selection of all members of our board of directors, as well as virtually every other matter that requires stockholder approval, which will severely limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nExcept in certain limited circumstances required by applicable law, holders of Class A and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders. Mr. Sakellaris, our founder, principal stockholder, president, and chief executive officer, owns all of our Class B common stock, which, together with his Class A common stock, represents approximately 74% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, holders of shares of Class B common stock may generally transfer those shares to family members, including spouses and descendants or the spouses of such descendants, as well as to affiliated entities, without having the shares automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock. Therefore, Mr. Sakellaris, his affiliates, and his family members and descendants will, for the foreseeable future, be able to control the outcome of the voting on virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as an acquisition of our company, even if they come to own, in the aggregate, as little as 20% of the economic interest of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Moreover, these persons may take actions in their own interests that you or our other stockholders do not view as beneficial.\nThough we may repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, we are not obligated to do so and if we do, we may purchase only a limited number of shares of Class A common stock.\nIn May 2016, we announced a stock repurchase program under which the Company is currently authorized to repurchase, in the aggregate, up to $17.6 million of our outstanding Class A common stock. However, we are not obligated to acquire any shares of our Class A common stock, and holders of our Class A common stock should not rely on the share repurchase program to increase their liquidity. The amount and timing of any share repurchases will depend upon a variety of factors, including the trading price of our Class A common stock, liquidity, securities laws restrictions, other regulatory restrictions, potential alternative uses of capital, and market and economic conditions. We intend to purchase through open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulatory limitations. We may reduce or eliminate our share repurchase program in the future. The reduction or elimination of our share repurchase program, particularly if we do not repurchase the full number of shares authorized under the program, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA failure of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and data security infrastructure, or if we or our vendors experience cyber security incidents or have a vulnerability or other deficiency in cybersecurity, could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability, and security of our IT and data security infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning or a security breach of our IT systems, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. We receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and other similar disruptions, and we have experienced such incidents in the past. Any system failure, accident, or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information, or other confidential matter.\nWe have been subject to and may in the future experience cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on internet applications. Furthermore, some of the assets we own or operate constitute critical infrastructure which could become targets for cyberattacks. These threats could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems. In addition, cybersecurity incidents at our vendors, customers and partners may have similar negative impact on our business operations. For example, we engage third-party vendors who receive and store personal and sensitive information in connection with our operations, including our human resources functions such as background checks. We do not have control over or access to the IT infrastructure of these vendors. Our vendors have and may in the future experience network breaches, unauthorized access, hacking and other cyberattacks. In such instances, we are not be able to fully investigate the incidents and may not be able to implement measures to defend such attacks. Furthermore, third-party vendors may not notify us of such incidents timely or at all, making it more difficult for us to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Although we devote resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems, change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely.\nAs these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personal, proprietary or customer information, or inability for us to operate the assets we own or operate for our customers, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and employees, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and future public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe may face risks related to public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases. A widespread healthcare crisis, such as an outbreak of a communicable disease could adversely affect the global economy our ability to conduct business for an indefinite period of time. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has negatively impacted global economy, disrupted financial markets and international trade and significantly impacted global supply chains. In addition, Federal, state, and local governments have implemented various mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, border closings, and limitations on business. Some of these actions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the ability of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners to conduct business activities, and depending on development of the pandemic, could ultimately do so for an indefinite period of time. The COVID-19 impacts described above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In particular, the continued effects of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus:\n\u2022has lengthened and could continue to lengthen our sales cycles,\n\u2022could cause us to experience an increase in delayed payments from customers and uncollectible accounts,\n\u2022has caused and could continue to cause delays and disruptions in the completion of certain projects (including as a result of the global supply chain challenges),\n\u2022could impact availability of qualified personnel and general labor shortages, and\n\u2022could cause other unpredictable events.\nVaccines for COVID-19 continue to be administered in the United States and other countries around the world, but the extent and rate of vaccine adoption, the long-term efficacy of these vaccines, and other factors remain uncertain, and the potential for a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the United States and globally. Furthermore, current or future vaccine requirements (such as the executive order issued by President Biden in October 2021, which required us as an employer with federal government contracts to ensure that our U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors, that work on or in support of federal contracts, were fully vaccinated) may result in additional compliance cost and impact our ability to retain and recruit critically skilled workforce. Overall, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the extent to which it may impact our business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, the emergence and spread of more transmissible variants, travel restrictions, business, workforce disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease.", "PERMNO": 10158, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "AMRC"}
