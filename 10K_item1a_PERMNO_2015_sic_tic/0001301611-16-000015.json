{"cik": "1301611", "company": "LIFEPOINT HEALTH, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are several factors, some beyond our control, that could cause results to differ significantly from our expectations. Some of these factors are described below. Other factors, such as market, operational, liquidity, interest rate and other risks, are described elsewhere in this report (see, for example, Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Any factor described in this report could by itself, or together with one or more factors, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. There may be factors not described in this report that could also cause results to differ from our expectations.\nOur revenues will decline if federal or state programs reduce our Medicare or Medicaid payments or if managed care companies reduce reimbursement amounts. In addition, the financial condition of payors and healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit our revenues and profitability.\nIn 2015, we derived 45.2% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, collectively. Numerous factors could materially decrease, or delay timing of, Medicare and Medicaid payments to our facilities. These factors include statutory and regulatory payment reduction or other changes, administrative rulings and determinations concerning patient and provider eligibility, the method of calculating reimbursements and requirements for utilization review. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Pathway Act and PAMA, the Tax Relief Act and the ATRA provide for material scheduled reductions in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid program spending, including reductions in market basket updates and DSH funding.\nMedicaid programs, which are jointly funded by federal and state governments and are administered by states, provide healthcare benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. A number of states have adopted or are considering legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures, including enrolling Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals to help finance such states\u2019 Medicaid systems.\nIn addition, revenues from HMOs, PPOs, insurance companies, employers and other private payors are the result of negotiated rates. These rates may decline based on renegotiations and the respective bargaining power of the parties. In addition, the general trend towards further consolidation among private payors should increase their bargaining power over fee structures. As a result, payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk related to paying for care provided. This includes moving away from a percent of charge payment structure to a fixed payment, which typically reduces our reimbursement rate and limits our ability to raise prices going forward. The impact of these changes is magnified by the fact that many individuals and employers have moved to private payor plans. Low cost plans purchased through the healthcare exchanges are also increasingly using narrow and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices, restrict or exclude our facilities or impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier.\nEfforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and private payors will continue, thereby reducing the payments we receive for our services. As reimbursement from payors is reduced, if we are excluded from more payor networks or if the scope of services covered by payors is limited, there could be a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict with a great level of precision the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its ongoing implementation may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Affordable Care Act continues to alter the U.S. healthcare system by decreasing the number of uninsured Americans and through its attempts to reduce the overall cost of healthcare. The Affordable Care Act attempts to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, providing additional funding for Medicaid in states that choose to expand their programs, reducing Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments to providers, expanding the Medicare program\u2019s use of value-based purchasing programs, tying hospital payments to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria, bundling payments to hospitals and other providers, and instituting certain private health insurance reforms. The Affordable Care Act includes certain reductions in Medicare spending, such as negative adjustments to the hospital inpatient and outpatient prospective payment system market basket updates, the revision of annual inflation updates and other cost-containment measures, including planned payment reductions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBeginning in 2014, and primarily as a result of the expansion of state Medicaid programs, we experienced an increase in revenues from providing care to certain previously uninsured individuals. While we expect this trend to continue, the future impact and timing of such coverage expansion, and utilization of care by newly-insured individuals, remains difficult to predict and may not offset scheduled decreases in reimbursement. Only ten of the states in which we operate have decided to implement expansions to their Medicaid programs. Accordingly, some low-income persons in other states that are not expanding Medicaid will not have insurance coverage as intended by the Affordable Care Act.\nA number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that were originally scheduled to have already become effective, such as the employer mandate (for employers with 50 to 99 employees), the Small Business Health Option Program (for employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees), and the Cadillac Tax, were delayed until 2016 or later. Additional delays in the implementation of these or other provisions of the Affordable Care Act could be imposed in the future. We are unable to predict with a high level of precision how providers, payors, employers and other market participants will continue to respond to the various reform provisions because certain provisions are scheduled for implementation over the coming years. Furthermore, several bills have been and may continue to be introduced in Congress to delay, defund or repeal implementation of or amend all significant provisions of the Affordable Care Act, and there is ongoing litigation over the interpretation and implementation of certain provisions of the law. As a result of these factors and numerous other variables, including the law\u2019s complexity and the lack of complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, we are unable to predict with any certainty the future net effect of the Affordable Care Act on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations through joint ventures, which may expose us to risks and uncertainties.\nFor financial or strategic reasons, we conduct much of our business through joint ventures. By far the largest of our joint ventures is Duke LifePoint Healthcare, which is owned by the Company and a wholly-controlled affiliate of Duke, and which currently operates fourteen hospital campuses in four states, including recent acquisitions effective January 1, 2016. In recent years, most of our large acquisitions have been conducted through Duke LifePoint Healthcare.\nWhile we own a substantial majority of the equity in Duke LifePoint Healthcare, the long term success of Duke LifePoint Healthcare is dependent on ongoing collaboration and the alignment of our interests with those of Duke. In the event of a material disagreement with Duke or the breach of our joint venture agreement, Duke LifePoint Healthcare may be subject to dissolution, unwinding or purchase of either party\u2019s interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Even if Duke LifePoint Healthcare is not dissolved or unwound, our inability to involve Duke LifePoint Healthcare in our acquisitions and future operations could make it more difficult to source new targets or win competitive bidding processes, and our revenue or earnings growth may be hindered.\nWe may encounter difficulty operating, integrating and improving financial performance at acquired facilities. If we acquire facilities with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.\nWe may be unable to timely and effectively integrate facilities that we acquire with our ongoing operations and to achieve the anticipated financial results and synergies from such acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate. Many of the facilities we have acquired had, or future acquisitions may have, significantly lower operating margins than we do and/or operating losses prior to the time we acquired or will acquire them. In the past, we have occasionally experienced delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of our acquired facilities and we may experience such delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly or future acquired facilities. Integrating an acquired facility could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel.\nWe must integrate complex information, compliance, accounting and operational systems and internal controls over financial reporting of acquired facilities into our existing systems and internal controls. While we devote a significant amount of employee and management resources on these integrations, we also rely heavily on third parties for systems integration. Our efforts to integrate new facilities, including causing those third parties to convert our newly acquired facilities\u2019 systems, may fail or be significantly delayed. Failure to timely and effectively integrate or convert any of these systems could cause business interruption, affect physician and staff morale and our ability to accurately manage accounting, clinical, compliance and operational functions. As our acquisitions have become and may continue to become larger, any such failure could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBusinesses we have acquired, or businesses we acquire in the future, may have unknown or contingent liabilities for past activities, including liabilities for failure to comply with laws and regulations, retroactive payment adjustments or recoupments from payor audits, medical and general professional malpractice liabilities, worker\u2019s compensation or other employee-related liabilities, previous tax liabilities and unacceptable business or accounting practices. Although we endeavor to obtain contractual indemnification from sellers covering these matters, any indemnification obtained from sellers may be insufficient to cover material claims or liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses. In addition, the actions we take to resolve compliance or regulatory issues within acquired facilities may affect our revenue or results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChanges to Medicaid supplemental payment programs may materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nMedicaid supplemental payments (\u201cMSPs\u201d) are payments made to providers separate from and in addition to those made at a state\u2019s standard Medicaid payment rate. The two most prevalent forms of MSPs are DSH and Upper Payment Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) payments. Medicaid DSH payments are federally required to be made by the states to hospitals that serve significant numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients in recognition of the added costs incurred by hospitals in treating these patients. The total amount of Medicaid DSH payments a state may make and the total amount any one hospital may receive are both capped by federal law. Unlike Medicaid DSH payments, UPL payments are not required to be made by states under federal law. Rather, federal regulations establish an upper payment limit above which states may not receive federal matching dollars. UPL programs have expanded in recent years and related MSPs to our hospitals have similarly increased as states use UPL programs as a way to avoid or mitigate reimbursement cuts to providers.\nPursuant to the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Pathway Act, PAMA and MACRA, funding for Medicaid DSH programs is to be significantly reduced beginning in FFY 2018. Because many of the states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid programs as intended under the Affordable Care Act, the reduction in Medicaid DSH payments may take place without a coupled increase in the Medicaid eligible population, thus increasing the net amount of uncompensated care we provide.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent governmental regulations, and we may face allegations that we have failed to comply with such regulations, which could result in sanctions and even greater scrutiny that reduce our revenues and profitability.\nAll participants in the healthcare industry are required to comply with numerous overlapping laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations require that hospitals meet various requirements, including those relating to relationships with physicians and other referral sources, the adequacy and quality of medical care, inpatient admission criteria, privacy and security of health information, standards for equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, billing and cost reports, payment for services and supplies, maintenance of adequate records, compliance with building codes and environmental protection, among other matters. Many of the laws and regulations applicable to the healthcare industry are complex and may be violated inadvertently, and there are numerous enforcement authorities, including CMS, OIG, the Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and contracted auditors, as well as private plaintiffs. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act created potential False Claims Act liabilities for failing to report and repay identified overpayments within sixty (60) days of identifying the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later.\nThere are also heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry, including the hospital segment. Recent enforcement actions have focused on financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, billing for services without adequately documenting the medical necessity for such services and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such services. Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focal areas of the OIG and other governmental fraud and abuse programs, as described in the annual OIG Work Plan. Certain of our facilities have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental agencies regarding these matters, and we are also subject to various claims and lawsuits relating to these and other matters. For a further discussion of these inquiries, proceedings and claims, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3 of this Report.\nThe laws and regulations with which we must comply are constantly changing. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our business practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate our hospitals or loss of our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs.\nFinally, we are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. For example, our healthcare operations generate medical waste, such as pharmaceuticals, biological materials and disposable medical instruments that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Environmental regulations also may apply when we build new facilities or renovate existing hospitals, particularly older facilities. If we fail to comply with environmental regulations we may be liable for substantial investigation and clean-up costs or we may be subject to lawsuits by governmental authorities or private plaintiffs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be subjected to actions brought by the government under anti-fraud and abuse provisions or by individuals on the government\u2019s behalf under the False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false claims for payment to the federal government. The \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. We are required to provide information to our employees and certain contractors about state and federal false claims laws and whistleblower provisions and protections. Defendants found to be liable under the federal False Claims Act may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties ranging between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, subject to annual increases as set forth in the BBA.\nThere are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act, including reckless or intentional acts or omissions. In addition, the Affordable Care Act created False Claims Act liability for the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, and a number of states have adopted their own false claims and whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Although we intend and will endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, many of these laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied in ways that cannot be predicted. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will be free from government scrutiny or be found to be in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.\nWe may be subject to liabilities because of malpractice and related legal claims brought against our facilities or healthcare providers associated with, or employed by, our facilities or affiliated entities. If we become subject to these claims, we could be required to pay significant damages, which may not be covered by insurance.\nWe may be subject to medical malpractice lawsuits and other legal actions arising out of the operations of our owned and leased facilities and the activities of our employed or affiliated physicians. As a matter of policy, we typically notify patients of any potential harms they may have suffered at our facilities, regardless of whether such notifications are required by law and notwithstanding our uncertainty as to the severity of such harms or whether they even took place. This may lead to class actions or other multi-plaintiff lawsuits or whistleblower reports. These actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs and, if we or our facilities are found liable, any judgments against us may be material. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement whether or not we believe we are liable. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters also may be material.\nAlthough we maintain professional and general liability insurance with unrelated commercial insurance carriers, each individual plaintiff\u2019s claim is generally subject to the SIR, which for some periods has been as high as $10.0 million. Any successful claim against us that is within our SIR amounts could have an adverse effect on our results of results of operations or liquidity. Some of these claims could exceed the scope of the excess coverage in effect, or coverage of particular claims could be denied, and any amounts not covered by insurance could be material.\nInsurance coverage in the future may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable SIR level amounts. One or more of our insurance carriers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill its obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due. In addition, physicians using our facilities may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms, which could result in these physicians not being able to meet the minimum insurance requirements in the applicable medical staff bylaws or necessitate a reduction in the level of insurance required to be carried under such bylaws.\nAs a result of reviews of claims to Medicare and Medicaid for our services, we may experience delayed payments or incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare for payment for our services. These post-payment reviews may increase as a result of government cost-containment initiatives, including enhanced medical necessity reviews for Medicare patients admitted as inpatients to general acute care hospitals for certain procedures (e.g., cardiovascular procedures) and audits of Medicare claims under the RAC programs. RACs utilize a post-payment targeted review process employing data analysis techniques in order to identify those Medicare claims most likely to contain overpayments, such as incorrectly coded services, short stays, incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services and duplicate payments. The claims review strategies used by the RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large majority of the total amounts recovered by RACs has come from hospitals.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded the RAC program\u2019s scope to include managed Medicare and to include Medicaid claims, and all states are now required to establish programs to contract with RACs. In addition, CMS employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (\u201cMICs\u201d) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have also increased their review activities. Third party audits or investigations of Medicare or Medicaid claims could result in increases or decreases in operating revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related services were performed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFactors related to our employment of physicians could affect our financial performance.\nWe have significantly increased the number of physicians we employ. We believe that physician employment by acute care hospitals is consistent with industry trends and has become more common as a result of actual and potential reductions in payment amounts for physician services and increasing costs to physicians, such as EHR implementation and professional liability insurance expenses. Employed physicians generally present more direct risks to us than those presented by independent members of our hospitals\u2019 medical staffs, as well as require us to incur additional expenses. The potential liabilities and increased expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if current trends continue.\nControls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues.\nOver the last several years, payors have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit the use of inpatient services. Controls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization review,\u201d have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with outsourcing functions to third parties.\nTo improve operating margins, productivity and efficiency, we outsource selected nonclinical business functions to third parties. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of independent third parties to whom the Company delegates selected functions, including revenue cycle management, patient access, billing, cash collections, payment compliance and support services, project implementation, supply chain management and payroll services.\nArrangements with third party service providers may make our operations vulnerable if vendors fail to satisfy their obligations to us as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition, or other matters outside of our control. We may also face legal, financial or reputational harm for the actions or omissions of such providers, and we may not have effective recourse against the providers for those harms. Effective management, development and implementation of our outsourcing strategies are important to our business and strategy. If there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or our third party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not fully realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of the outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with key vendors, which could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs and a risk of operational delays, potential errors and possible control issues as a result of the termination or during the transition phase.\nDeterioration in the collectability of \u201cpatient due\u201d accounts could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe primary collection risks associated with our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and co-payments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. While we have experienced a reduction in uninsured patients, the risk of collection from insured patients, and the amounts due, have increased, and will likely continue to increase, as more individuals are enrolled in insurance plans with high deductibles or high co-payments, including those purchased on insurance exchanges. Additionally, plans purchased through the Exchanges are increasingly using narrow and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices. If we provide services when not a participating provider in the network, it can result in higher patient responsibility amounts that a patient may not have the ability to pay or may choose not to pay.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe amount of our provision for doubtful accounts is based on our assessments of historical collection trends, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health coverage and other collection indicators. If the recent decrease in the uninsured population as a result of the Affordable Care Act does not continue, the proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could adversely affect our collections of accounts receivable, results of operations and revenues. In addition, even after full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we may continue to experience bad debts and be required to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for patients that choose not to purchase coverage, undocumented immigrants who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government healthcare programs and in states that do not expand their Medicaid programs.\nThe industry emphasis on value-based purchasing may negatively affect our revenues.\nThere is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payors currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. CMS has previously announced its goal that 90% of Medicare fee-for-service payments be within value-based purchasing categories by the end of 2018, with 50% of Medicare payments being tied to quality or value through the use of alternative payment models, and many large private payors and state Medicaid programs have declared similar goals. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively affect our revenues.\nWe may have difficulty acquiring hospitals on favorable terms.\nA significant element of our business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals, especially those around which a system of hospitals and other healthcare services can be created. We face significant competition to acquire attractive hospitals, and we may not find suitable acquisitions on favorable terms. Our primary competitors for acquisitions have included for-profit and tax-exempt hospitals and hospital systems and privately capitalized start-up companies. Buyers with a strategic desire for any particular hospital - for example, a hospital located near existing hospitals or those who will realize economic synergies - have demonstrated an ability and willingness to pay premium prices for hospitals. Strategic buyers, as a result, can present a competitive barrier to our acquisition efforts.\nThe cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospital\u2019s results of operations, allocation of purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limitations on rate increases.\nEven if we are able to identify an attractive target, we may need to obtain financing for acquisitions, joint ventures or required capital improvements. Such financing may not be available, or we may incur or assume additional indebtedness as a result. Any financing arrangements we enter into may not be on terms favorable to us, and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or stock price.\nIn recent years, the legislatures and attorneys general of several states have become more interested in approving the sales of hospitals by tax-exempt entities. This heightened scrutiny may increase the cost and difficulty, or prevent the completion, of transactions with tax-exempt organizations in the future. Our failure to acquire hospitals consistent with our growth plans could prevent us from increasing our revenues.\nIf we do not effectively attract, recruit and retain qualified physicians, our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently will be adversely affected.\nThe success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals. The success of our efforts to recruit and retain quality physicians depends on several factors, including the actual and perceived quality of services provided by our hospitals, our ability to meet demands for new technology, our ability to identify and communicate with physicians who want to practice in our communities. Our ability to attract and retain physicians is increasingly dependent on the ability of our hospitals to offer and sustain employment arrangements. In particular, we face intense competition in the recruitment and retention of specialists and primary care physicians. We may not be able to recruit all of the physicians we target. In addition, we will incur increased malpractice, compensation, compliance and insurance expenses as the number of employed physicians continues to grow.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdditionally, our ability to recruit and employ physicians is closely regulated. For example, the types, amount and duration of compensation and assistance we can provide to recruited physicians are limited by the Stark law, the Anti-kickback Statute, state anti-kickback statutes, and related regulations. All arrangements with physicians must also be fair market value and commercially reasonable.\nIn addition to these legal requirements, there is competition from other communities and facilities for these physicians, and this competition continues after the physician is practicing in one of our communities. For example, integrated accountable care organizations and other kinds of \u201cnarrow\u201d provider networks or organizations may exclude our physicians from their plans\u2019 networks of healthcare providers. These contracting networks often organize hospitals, physicians and ancillary healthcare providers into exclusive networks involving a fewer number of healthcare providers. If our affiliated providers are excluded from such networks, we may have difficulty recruiting new providers or retaining existing providers.\nGenerally, a small number of attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions. The loss of one or more of these physicians - even if temporary - could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians.\nOur hospitals face competition for management and other non-physician staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability.\nIn addition to our physicians, the operations of our hospitals are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and staff personnel responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other non-physician healthcare professionals. In some markets, the scarce availability of nurses and other medical support personnel presents a significant operating issue and the competition for experienced and talented hospital management personnel is intense. This may result in employee turnover, require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain management, nurses and other medical support personnel, recruit personnel from foreign countries, and hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Because a significant percentage of our revenue consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or results of operations.\nIf access to our information systems is interrupted or restricted, or if we are unable to make changes to our information systems, our operations could suffer.\nOur business depends heavily on effective information systems to process clinical, operational and financial information. Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology. We rely on multiple third party providers of financial, clinical, patient accounting and network information services and, as a result, we face operational challenges in maintaining multiple provider platforms and facilitating the interface of such systems with one another. The third party providers may not have appropriate controls to protect confidential information. We do not control the information systems of third party providers, and in some cases we may have difficulty accessing information archived on third party systems, which could subject us to liability for failure to respond to legal or payor information requests. If these systems fail or are interrupted, if our access to these systems is limited in the future or if providers develop systems more appropriate for the urban healthcare market and not suited for our hospitals, our operations could suffer.\nIn addition, as new information systems are developed in the future, we will need to integrate them into our existing systems. Evolving industry and regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and EHR meaningful use regulations, may require changes to our information systems in the future. System conversions are costly, time consuming and disruptive for physicians, staff and, in some cases, patients. Some of our hospitals have recently converted or are currently converting from their existing system to another third party information system. If such conversions occurred on a large scale or if conversions at our larger facilities experience difficulties, the costs and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record and coding systems, our operations could be adversely affected.\nAs required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d), the HHS has developed and implemented an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals that adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. HHS uses the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (\u201cPECOS\u201d) to verify Medicare enrollment prior to making EHR incentive program payments. If our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, including having an enrollment record in PECOS, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems. Further, beginning in FFY 2015, eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare. Even if we do meet such requirements, the incentive payments we have received in prior years for EHR implementation are scheduled to be materially reduced over the coming years and to end entirely in 2017. EHR incentive payments that we have previously recognized are subject to audit and potential recoupment if it is determined that we did not meet the applicable meaningful use standards required in connection with such incentive payments.\nWe are in the process of converting certain of our clinical and patient accounting information system applications to newer versions of existing applications or all together new applications at several of our facilities. In connection with our implementations and conversions, we have incurred significant capitalized costs and additional training and implementation expenses. System conversions to comply with EHR could be time consuming and disruptive for physicians and employees. Failure to implement EHR systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHealth plans and providers, including our hospitals, were required to transition to the new ICD-10 coding system by October 1, 2015, which greatly expands the number and detail of billing codes used for inpatient claims. As a result of our implementation of ICD-10, we have made additional investments in technology and training. Although we believe we have made all of the modifications necessary to ensure full compliance with the changes prescribed by ICD-10, we may still be affected by third party implementation difficulties, and experience delays in reimbursement, underpayment for services or possible denials of payments from payors. Further, the transition to the more detailed ICD-10 coding system could cause decreased reimbursement if conditions are reclassified to MS-DRGs or commercial payment groupings with lower levels of reimbursement than the assignments under the previous system. At this early stage of transition, we are not able to predict the overall financial impact that ICD-10 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to potential legal and reputational risk as a result of our access to personal information of our patients and employees. A cybersecurity attack or security breach could subject us to legal claims and liabilities, reputational harm and business disruption.\nThere are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing employee, patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access to or theft of personal information. In the ordinary course of our business, we, and vendors acting on our behalf, collect and store sensitive data, including individual health data and other personally identifiable information of our patients and employees and such information is often targeted by criminal organizations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with HIPAA and other privacy and information security laws. The HHS Office for Civil Rights has imposed civil monetary penalties and corrective action plans on covered entities for violating HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security rules. In addition, state attorneys general and private plaintiffs have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages in response to violations of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security rules. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may not be able to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective protective measures, and we may be required to expand significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen our security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our information systems and infrastructure, or invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. Our networks and technology systems are also subject to disruption due to events such as a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event. If, in spite of our security and compliance efforts we or any of our business associates were to experience a breach, loss, or other compromise of such personal health information or other personally identifiable information, such event could disrupt our operations, result in increased data protection costs, damage our reputation, or result in regulatory penalties, legal claims and liability under HIPAA and other state and federal laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOther hospitals and outpatient facilities provide services similar to those which we offer. In addition, physicians provide services in their offices that could be provided in our hospitals. These factors increase the level of competition we face and may therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nCompetition among hospitals and other healthcare service providers, including outpatient facilities, has intensified in recent years. We compete with other hospitals, including larger tertiary care centers located in metropolitan areas. Although the hospitals with which we compete may be a significant distance away from our facilities, patients in our markets may migrate on their own to, may be referred by local physicians to, or may be required by their health plan to travel to these hospitals. Furthermore, some of the hospitals with which we compete may offer more or different services than those available at our hospitals, may have more advanced equipment or technology or may have a medical staff that is perceived to be better qualified. Also, most of the hospitals that compete with our facilities are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals, in most instances, are also exempt from paying sales, property and income taxes.\nQuality of care and value-based purchasing have also become significant trends and competitive factors in the healthcare industry. CMS makes public the performance data relating to multiple quality measures that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. If the publicly-available performance data become a primary factor in where patients choose to receive care, and if competing hospitals have better results than our hospitals on those measures, our revenues and/or patient volumes could decline.\nWe also face significant and increasing competition from services offered by physicians (including physicians on our medical staffs) in their offices and from other specialized care providers, including outpatient surgery, oncology, physical therapy and diagnostic centers (including many in which physicians may have an ownership interest). Some of our hospitals have and will seek to develop outpatient facilities where necessary to compete effectively. However, to the extent that other providers are successful in developing outpatient facilities or physicians are able to offer additional, advanced services in their offices, our market share for these services will likely decrease in the future.\nMany of the non-urban communities in which we operate continue to face challenging economic conditions and the closure of a small number of large employers in our markets can have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.\nWhile the U.S. economy as a whole is expanding, many of the non-urban communities in which we operate continue to face challenging economic conditions, including high levels of unemployment. The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers, especially manufacturing or similar facilities. These employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals for care. The failure of one or more large employers, or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or similar facilities located in or near many of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. When patients are experiencing personal financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions, they may choose to:\n\u2022defer or forego elective surgeries and other non-emergent procedures, which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals; or\n\u2022purchase a high-deductible insurance plan or no insurance at all, which increases a hospital\u2019s dependence on self-pay revenue. Moreover, a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms.\nThe occurrence of these events may impede our business strategies intended to generate organic growth and improve operating results at our hospitals.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur revenues are especially concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate the majority of our revenues including Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee and New Mexico. The following table contains our revenues and revenues as a percentage of our total revenues by state for each of these states for the years presented (dollars in millions):\nAccordingly, any changes in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions, or to Medicaid programs, in the above-mentioned states could have an adverse effect on our revenues or results of operations. Our concentration of revenues in these states also make it more likely that hurricanes, floods, persistent drought, power grid interruption or other factors beyond our control in these states could adversely affect our revenues or results of operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in the future which could affect our ability to finance operations and capital expenditures, pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully operate our business in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, discount and premium, was $2,691.0 million. We also have the ability to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness, subject to the conditions imposed by the terms of the agreements and indentures governing our existing indebtedness or any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future.\nAlthough we believe that our future operating cash flow, together with available financing arrangements, will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements, our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nUnder our debt agreements, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and tests. Failure to comply with these obligations may cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately. Moreover, if debt repayment is accelerated, we will be subject to higher interest rates on our debt obligations as a result of these covenants, and our credit ratings may be adversely impacted.\n\u00b7\nWe may be vulnerable in the event of downturns and adverse changes in the general economy or our industry.\n\u00b7\nWe may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.\n\u00b7\nWe will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.\n\u00b7\nAny borrowings we incur at variable interest rates generally expose us to increases in interest rates.\n\u00b7\nA breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements could cause a cross-default under other debt agreements. We may be required to pay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the debt agreements. It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. If any senior debt is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness and our other indebtedness.\n\u00b7\nIn the event of a default, we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that sufficient funds could be obtained to make these accelerated payments.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCovenant restrictions under certain of our debt agreements and indentures impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to operate our business and to make payments on the notes and other outstanding indebtedness.\nAgreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our other debt obligations. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock or certain other debt;\n\u00b7\nmake other restricted payments, including investments;\n\u00b7\ndispose of assets;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u00b7\neffect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, lease all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nrepay our existing outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow through operations or successfully access other capital resources to fund all of our capital expenditure commitments in connection with acquired facilities.\nAs part of our on-going acquisition strategy, we often commit to making significant capital improvements at acquired facilities over a number of years. At December 31, 2015, we estimated our total remaining unfulfilled capital expenditure commitments to be approximately $1,702.6 million. Please see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d for more information about the general timing and impact of these contractual obligations.\nWe may experience delays or impediments in satisfying the schedule for capital expenditure commitments because of a variety of factors beyond our control, such as zoning, environmental, licensing and certificate of need regulations and restrictions. Additionally, our cash flows and available capital resources may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditure commitment obligations, and we may be forced to reduce or delay required capital expenditures.\nThe failure to satisfy our capital expenditure commitment obligations could damage our reputation within our communities, expose us to potential claims from former owners of acquired facilities or other governing or regulatory agencies, and adversely impact our ability to negotiate and complete future acquisitions.\nCertificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses, ownership and operation may impair our future expansion in some states. In states without certificate of need laws, competing providers of healthcare services are able to expand and construct facilities without the need for significant regulatory approval.\nSome states require prior approval for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities, based on the state\u2019s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. In addition, certain states in which we operate hospitals require a certificate of need for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or services, and for certain other planned activities. We may not be able to obtain certificates of need required for expansion activities in the future. In addition, all of the states in which we operate facilities require hospitals and most healthcare providers to maintain one or more licenses. If we fail to obtain any required certificate of need or license, our ability to operate or expand operations in those states could be impaired.\nSome states in which we operate do not require certificates of need for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services. Additionally, from time to time, states with existing requirements may repeal or limit the scope of their certificate of need programs. Our competing healthcare providers face lower barriers to entry and expansion in such states. If these competing providers of healthcare services are able to purchase, construct or expand healthcare facilities without the need for regulatory approval, we may face decreased market share and revenues in those markets.", "PERMNO": 86899, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "LPNT"}
