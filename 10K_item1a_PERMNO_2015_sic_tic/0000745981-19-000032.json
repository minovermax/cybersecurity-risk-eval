Investors should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information in this Report and the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision. The realization of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur industry and business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally and in our market areas.\nIn recent years, we have faced periods of challenging and uncertain economic conditions, including a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry in our market areas. A return of recessionary conditions similar to 2008-2009 and/or a deterioration of national or local economic conditions could adversely affect the financial condition and operating performance of financial institutions. Specifically, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increased unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in levels of non-performing and classified assets and a decline in demand for products and services offered by financial institutions. While general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, as well as in the U.S. and worldwide, continued to improve during 2018, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business\n- 18 -\nspending, borrowing and savings habits, which could cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur market areas are heavily dependent on, and we have significant credit exposure to, the oil and gas industry.\nThe economy in a large portion of our market areas is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. Many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities. We define an energy loan as any loan where the borrower's ability to repay is disproportionately impacted by a prolonged downturn in energy prices. Under this definition, the Bank includes direct Commercial and Industrial (\"C&I\") loans to energy borrowers, as well as Commercial Real Estate loans, Residential Real Estate loans and loans to energy-related borrowers where the loan's primary collateral is cash and marketable securities. Although this definition has resulted in a lack of comparability with some other energy-related banks, management believes it to be the prudent approach to monitoring and managing the Bank's energy exposure. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $112.6 million in loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry, as defined above, representing approximately 12.5% of our total loans outstanding as of that date. The average loan size is approximately $377,000, and the average loan size per relationship is roughly $500,000. The oil and gas industry, especially in Louisiana and Texas, has been subject to significant volatility, including the \u201coil bust\u201d of the 1980s that severely impacted the economies of many of our market areas and, more recently, volatility in oil and gas prices and volatility in the level of drilling and production activity in Texas, Louisiana and other areas of the U.S. Decisions by certain members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain higher crude oil production levels have led to increased global oil supplies, which, when coupled with the continued exporting restrictions on the U.S. oil and gas industry and weaker global demand, has resulted in sustained low domestic market oil prices. Sustained low market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S.-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. These adverse developments in the oil and gas industry have had negative effects on the economies of our market areas in general, including adverse effects on commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. If oil prices remain at these low levels for an extended period, the Bank could experience weaker oil and gas related loan demand and increased losses within its oil and gas loan portfolio. Furthermore, a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Louisiana and Texas. Accordingly, if there is further deterioration in the oil and gas industry it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of our allowance for loan losses.\nWe have experienced increases in the levels of our non-performing assets and loan charge-offs in recent periods. Our total non-performing assets amounted to $30.5 million, or 1.75% of our total assets, at December 31, 2018, and we had $26.2 million of net loan charge-offs and a $16.7 million provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the ratios of our ALLL to non-performing loans and to total loans outstanding were 195.40% and 1.94%, respectively. Additional increases in our non-performing assets or loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we still may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ALLL. We create an ALLL in our accounting records, based on, among other considerations, the following:\n\u2022\nindustry historical losses as reported by the FDIC;\n\u2022\nhistorical experience with our loans;\n\u2022\nevaluation of economic conditions;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of the quality mix, including our distribution of loans by risk grade within our portfolio, and size of our overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of delinquencies; and\n\u2022\nthe quality of the collateral underlying our loans.\nAlthough we maintain an ALLL at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio, changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including conditions which are beyond our control such as a sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates, may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates. Additions\n- 19 -\nto the ALLL could result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow. Further, if our actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d referred to as \"CECL\" (current expected credit loss), which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets not recorded at fair value based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company intends to adopt ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020, and adoption of this ASU could materially affect its allowance for loan losses methodology, financial condition, capital levels and results of operations, including expenses the Company may incur in implementing this ASU.\nThe Company and the Bank have both been placed in troubled condition by their respective federal banking regulators, which subjects us to significant restrictions and will require us to designate a significant amount of resources to comply. A failure to comply with restrictions imposed on financial institutions in troubled condition or with the terms of the written agreement to which the Bank is subject within the required timeframes could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs discussed above in Item 1 under the heading \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation,\u201d the Company and the Bank are both in \u201ctroubled condition\u201d and the Bank has entered into a written agreement with the OCC. Because the Company is in troubled condition, the Company (1) must notify the Federal Reserve prior to adding or replacing a member of its board of directors or employing, or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer, and (2) may not, except under certain circumstances, enter into any agreements to make severance or indemnification payments or make any such payments to \u201cinstitution-affiliated parties\u201d as defined in the regulations. The Bank is subject to similar restrictions due to its troubled condition status. Under the written agreement, the Bank is also required to take certain immediate and continuing actions related to problem assets and lending practices, among other remedial actions.\nIf the Company or the Bank is not successful in complying with their respective regulatory restrictions, or the Bank does not comply with the written agreement within the required time frames, we could become subject to additional enforcement actions, sanctions or restrictions on our business activities. While subject to regulatory actions and restrictions, we expect that our management and Board of Directors will be required to focus considerable time and attention on taking corrective actions. We have also hired third party consultants and advisors to assist us, which will increase our non-interest expense and reduce our earnings. The Bank has appointed a committee to monitor compliance with the written agreement and is working to promptly address the requirements of the written agreement. There is no guarantee, however, that the Bank will successfully address the OCC\u2019s concerns in the written agreement or that we will be able to comply with it. If we do not comply with the written agreement, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties, further regulatory sanctions and/or other enforcement actions.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has issued a Consent Order with respect to our Bank Secrecy Act compliance. Failure to comply with the Consent Order could result in additional regulatory action.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program (\u201cBSA/AML Program\u201d) and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. On October 25, 2018, the Bank entered into a Stipulation to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the OCC, consenting to the issuance of a Consent Order relating to weaknesses in the Bank\u2019s BSA/AML Program. The Consent Order is expected to result in additional compliance expenses for the Bank. Issuance of the Consent Order does not preclude further enforcement actions with respect to the Bank\u2019s BSA/AML Program, including the possible imposition of fines, sanctions, and/or restrictions on the activities of the Bank. Failure to comply with the Consent Order could subject us to additional expense and result in these additional regulatory enforcement actions or enforcement of the Consent Order through court proceedings. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to additional enforcement actions that could have a material negative effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations or the value of our common stock.\nFederal and state regulators have the ability to impose substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on our banking subsidiaries if they determine, upon examination or otherwise, violations of laws, rules or regulations with which we or our subsidiaries must comply, or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, consent orders, written agreements, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closures. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital level of the institution. In particular, institutions that are not sufficiently capitalized in accordance with regulatory standards may also face capital directives or prompt corrective action. Enforcement actions may impose restrictions\n- 20 -\non the payment of dividends or severance payments, require certain corrective steps (including staff additions or changes), impose limits on activities (such as lending, deposit taking, ability to accept brokered-deposits or branching), prescribe lending parameters (such as loan types, volumes and terms), require the disposition of certain assets and liabilities, require additional capital to be raised or expenses to be incurred or prevent us from conducting any expansionary activities, including acquisitions. The imposition of any additional enforcement actions or regulatory sanctions or monetary penalties could have a material negative effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations or the value of our common stock.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, or Item 9A, two material weaknesses were identified in our internal control over financial reporting for the creation of tax entries and the preparation of the ALL. The specific issues leading to these conclusions are described in Item 9A in \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\u201d A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses identified in Item 9A did not result in any misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for any period presented. We have begun efforts to remediate the material weaknesses. However, our remedial measures to address the material weaknesses may be insufficient and we may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from errors, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement and manage our recently announced strategic initiatives, which could result in the failure to achieve the anticipated cost savings and materially impair our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have begun the implementation of a number of strategic initiatives to address the regulatory concerns and market challenges and to improve the overall profitability and financial condition of the Company and the Bank. There can be no assurances that these strategic initiatives will be successful in addressing these concerns and challenges, and if we are not successful in implementing and managing these strategic initiatives our profitability and financial condition could be materially impaired in future periods. We may also incur expenses in connection with these strategic initiatives beyond our current estimates, which may result in additional losses to us and the costs of these strategic initiatives outweighing any benefits resulting therefrom. Furthermore, if these strategic initiatives do not adequately address regulatory concerns, we could become subject to additional regulatory actions, including enforcement actions as described in the preceding risk factors.\nLoss of key officers or employees, or failure to successfully transition our management, could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nAs a community bank, our business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships. In addition, our success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by the ability to retain senior management and, with expansion, to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management. In May 2017, we replaced our President and Chief Executive Officer and have also recently appointed other new executive officers. Our future success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our new management team to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. We must successfully manage issues that may result from the transition of the new members of our executive management. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationships with our key personnel are good, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization. Loss of such key personnel, should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors, could result in the loss of some of our customers.\n- 21 -\nWe cannot predict the effect of recent or future legislative and regulatory initiatives.\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of substantial legislative and regulatory changes and may be the subject of further legislation or regulation in the future, including: (i) changes in banking, securities and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators, including pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and following the passage of the EGRRCPA as discussed above in Item 1 under the heading \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d; and (ii) changes in the scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverage, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations may cause our results of operations to differ materially from those we currently anticipate. In addition, the cost and burden of compliance with applicable laws and regulations have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our borrowers, and therefore on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements is uncertain.\nEffective as of January 1, 2019, the fully phased in Basel III Capital Rules apply to the Company and the Bank. These rules have substantially changed the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and modify the capital and asset definitions for purposes of calculating those ratios. Starting in January 1, 2015, the Basel III Capital Rules established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%, a higher minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 6.0% and a higher total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provided, to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized,\u201d a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement of 6.5% and a higher Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8.0%. Moreover, the Basel III Capital Rules limit a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of an additional 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the 4.5% minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement and the other amounts necessary to the minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe Company and the Bank currently satisfy the fully phased in Basel III Capital Rules. However, the application of these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in additional regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements in the future. Furthermore, Basel III\u2019s liquidity requirements could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. The continued implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could also result in us modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to pay dividends.\nWe have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. Given the size of these loan relationships relative to capital levels and earnings, a significant loss on any one of these loans could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. Our largest exposure to one borrowing relationship as of December 31, 2018, was approximately $11.9 million, which is 5.4% of our total capital. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the aggregate exposure to the ten largest borrowing relationships was approximately $96.8 million, which was 10.8% of loans and 43.6% of total capital. As a result of this concentration, a change in the financial condition of one or more of these borrowers could result in significant loan losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant percentage of our deposits are attributable to a relatively small number of customers. The loss of all or some of these customers or a significant decline in their deposit balances may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our 20 largest depositors accounted for approximately 12.9% of total deposits, of which our top five depositors accounted for approximately 6.6% of total deposits. The ability to attract these types of deposits has a positive effect on our net interest margin as they provide a relatively low cost of funds to the Bank. While we believe we have strong, long-term relationships with each of these customers, the loss of one or more of our 20 largest deposit customers, or a significant decline in the deposit balances would adversely affect our liquidity and require us to attract new deposits, purchase federal funds or borrow funds on a short-term basis to replace such deposits, possibly at interest rates higher than those currently paid on such deposits. This could increase our total cost of funds and could result in a decrease in our net interest income and net earnings. If we were unable to develop alternative funding sources, we may have difficulty funding loans or meeting other deposit withdrawal requirements.\n- 22 -\nWe occasionally purchase non-recourse loan participations from other banks based in part on information provided by the selling bank.\nFrom time to time, we purchase loan participations from other banks in the ordinary course of business, usually without recourse to the selling bank. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $34.9 million in purchased loan participations, or approximately 3.9% of our total loan portfolio. When we purchase loan participations, we apply the same underwriting standards as we would to loans that we directly originate and seek to purchase only loans that would satisfy these standards. However, we are not as familiar with the borrower and may rely on information provided to us by the selling bank and typically must rely on the selling bank\u2019s administration of the loan relationship. We therefore have less control over, and may incur more risk with respect to, loan participations that we purchase from selling banks as compared to loans that we originate.\nOur focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nMost of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate negatively impact this important customer sector, our results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio includes a substantial percentage of commercial and industrial loans, which may be subject to greater risks than those related to residential loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes a substantial percentage of commercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and historically have involved a greater degree of financial and credit risks than residential first mortgage loans. Repayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. At December 31, 2018, commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately 29.7% of our total loan portfolio. Adverse changes in local economic conditions impacting our business borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate, and an adverse change in the real estate market could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate. At December 31, 2018, approximately 65.4%% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment if the borrower defaults and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. An adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate in our primary markets could significantly impair the value of real estate collateral and the ability to sell real estate collateral upon foreclosure. Furthermore, it is likely that we would be required to increase the provision for loan losses. A related risk in connection with loans secured by real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination, which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as collateral. If we were required to liquidate real estate collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase the allowance for loan losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Bank\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 23 -\nOur future earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash charges for goodwill impairment, if a future test of goodwill indicates that goodwill has been impaired.\nAs prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. We conduct an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. After our most recent annual review in the fourth quarter of 2018, we concluded there was no goodwill impairment as of such date. As of December 31, 2018, we had $42.2 million in goodwill. Future goodwill impairment tests may result in future non-cash charges, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.\nChanges in the fair value of our securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2018, $437.8 million of our securities (at fair value) were classified as available-for-sale. At such date, the aggregate net unrealized loss on our available-for-sale securities was $6.2 million. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity securities which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nWe monitor the fair value of our entire securities portfolio as part of our ongoing other than temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges related to securities in the future. In addition, as a condition to membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (\u201cFHLB-Dallas\u201d), we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB-Dallas stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB-Dallas. At December 31, 2018, we had stock in the FHLB-Dallas totaling approximately $3.5 million. The FHLB-Dallas stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB-Dallas stock holdings. There can be no assurance, however, that future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB-Dallas may not require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Bank.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer to consumers covered financial products and services. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The concept of what may be considered to be an \u201cabusive\u201d practice is new under the law. While the Bank will not be supervised by the CFPB, it will still be subject to the regulations and policies promulgated by the CFPB and may be examined by the OCC for compliance therewith. The costs and limitations related to complying with any new regulations established by the CFPB have yet to be fully determined and could be material. Further, the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Bank with respect to its consumer product offerings and services may also produce significant, material effects on the Bank\u2019s (and our) profitability.\nA natural disaster, especially one affecting one of our market areas, could adversely affect us.\nSince most of our business is conducted in Louisiana and Texas, most of our credit exposure is in those states. Historically, Louisiana and Texas have been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio, as uninsured or underinsured losses, including losses from business disruption, may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters in our market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 24 -\nOur profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations.\nOur profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Conversely, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Furthermore, some of our variable interest rate loans have minimum fixed interest rates (\u201cfloors\u201d) that are currently above the contractual variable interest rate. If interest rates rise, the interest income from our variable interest rate loans with floors may not increase as quickly as interest expense on our liabilities, which would negatively impact our net interest income.\nThe banking industry has experienced a prolonged period of unusually low interest rates. The Federal Reserve began raising rates in late 2015 and their benchmark rate and market rates increased during 2016, 2017, and 2018. Although financial markets anticipate that the Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark rate multiple times during 2019, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the pace and extent to which interest rates may increase in 2019 and future periods and what the future effects of any such increases will be. There is no assurance that recent forecasts regarding interest rate increases will be realized.\nIn periods of increasing interest rates, loan originations may decline, depending on the performance of the overall economy, which may adversely affect income from lending activities and rates paid on deposits and borrowings may reprice before rates earned on loans or investment securities. Also, increases in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of fixed income assets. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest and principal on their obligations.\nUncertainty about the future of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and its accepted alternatives, may adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, the Company and the Bank hold certain financial instruments or engage in transactions that have an interest rate indexed to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based financial instruments given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally.\nUncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and interest rates indexed to LIBOR, as well as other interest rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to any alternative reference rates, and the effect of any changes or reforms to LIBOR or discontinuation of LIBOR on new or existing financial instruments to which we have exposure. If LIBOR ceases to exist, or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on financial instruments whose value is tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected. The manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, investment and trading securities portfolios, and business, is uncertain and may be materially adverse to our profitability.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing assets adversely affect our net earnings in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on non-performing loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our earnings, and increasing our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increase in the level of non-performing assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets, including taking actions required by the Bank's written agreement with the OCC, requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. We may also hire third party consultants and advisors to assist us, which would increase our non-interest expense and reduce our earnings. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in non-performing assets.\n- 25 -\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate within a highly regulated environment and our business and results are affected by the regulations to which we are subject.\nWe operate within a highly regulated environment. The regulations to which we are subject will continue to have an impact on our operations and the degree to which we can grow and be profitable. Certain regulators, to which we are subject, have significant power in reviewing our operations and approving our business practices. In recent years the Bank, as well as other financial institutions, has experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny, often requiring additional resources. In addition, investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other results adverse to us. There is no assurance that any change to the regulatory requirements to which we are subject, or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced, will not have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and use of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We are subject to complex laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of such personally identifiable information. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) require that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal laws and regulations impose data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase costs.\nIn addition, we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. We have invested in accepted technologies, and continually review processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers, and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, our computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged, or disclosed. A breach in security or other failure could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, increased expenses, loss of customers and business partners, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, as cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to expend significant additional financial and operational resources to modify or enhance its protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any identified information security vulnerabilities.\nWe rely heavily on technology and computer systems. The negative effects of computer system failures and unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruption of service could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits.\nOur ability to compete depends on our ability to continue to adapt and deliver technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet customers\u2019 demands for financial services. We provide our customers the ability to bank online and many customers now remotely submit deposits to us through remote-capture systems. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of these services. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses,\n- 26 -\nphishing schemes and other security problems. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nCybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.\nAs cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal banking agencies have proposed, but not finalized, enhanced cyber risk management standards, which could apply to a wide range of financial institutions and third-party service providers, including the Company and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals in certain circumstances. In addition, we may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may become subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results. For more information about cybersecurity and privacy regulations, please see the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 27 -\nRisks Relating to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur future ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock is subject to restrictions and we may be unable to pay future dividends even if we desire to do so.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Since we are a holding company, we have no material source of income other than dividends received from the Bank. Although we had $44.8 million of cash at December 31, 2018, historically, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders has depended on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us. Moreover, banks and bank holding companies are both subject to certain federal and state regulatory restrictions on cash dividends. We are also restricted from paying dividends if we have deferred payments of the interest on, or an event of default has occurred with respect to, our trust preferred securities, Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock. Additionally, terms and conditions of our outstanding shares of preferred stock place certain restrictions and limitations on our common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\nThe holders of our preferred stock and trust preferred securities have rights that are senior to those of stockholders and that may impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and net income available to our common stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $22.2 million of trust preferred securities. These securities are senior to shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on our trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock. Moreover, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, the obligations outstanding with respect to our trust preferred securities must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our stockholders. While we have the right to defer dividends on the trust preferred securities for a period of up to five years, if any such election is made, no dividends may be paid to our common or preferred stockholders during that time.\nIn addition, with respect to the $32.0 million in Series B Preferred Stock outstanding that was issued to the Treasury in the Small Business Lending Fund \"SBLF\" transaction, we are required to pay cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at an annual rate. The dividend rate was set at 1.00% beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to attaining the target 10% growth rate in qualified small business loans during the second quarter of 2013. Beginning February 25, 2016, the dividend rate increased to 9% per annum. The $9.0 million in Series C Preferred Stock currently outstanding that was originally issued in connection with the PSB acquisition calls for the non-cumulative payment of dividends at an annual rate of 4.0%. Dividends paid on our Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock will also reduce the net income available to our common stockholders and our earnings per common share. We may not declare or pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock without first having paid all accrued preferred dividends that are due.\nShare ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future.\nOur stock incentive plan provides for the granting of stock incentives to directors, officers, and employees. As of December 31, 2018, there were 75,826 shares issued under options. Likewise, approximately 522,156 shares may be issued in the future to directors, officers, and employees under our existing equity incentive plans. In addition, in 2009, as part of our participation in the Treasury\u2019s Capital Purchase Program (\u201cCPP\u201d), we issued a stock purchase warrant that currently entitles the holder to purchase 104,384 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $14.37 per share. It is probable that options and/or warrants will be exercised during their respective terms if the stock price exceeds the exercise price of the particular option or warrant. The incentive plan also provides that all issued options automatically and fully vest upon a change in control. If the options are exercised, share ownership will be diluted.\nAdditionally, share ownership of our common stock will be diluted from shares issued upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock issued in the PSB acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, there were 89,721 shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. Holders may convert the Series C Preferred Stock at any time into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion price of $18.00 per share, subject to customary antidilution adjustments. In addition, the Company currently has the option to require conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock if the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days, exceeds 130% of the conversion price.\nIn addition, our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 30,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, but do not provide for preemptive rights to the stockholders; therefore, stockholders will not automatically have the right to subscribe for additional shares. As a result, if we issue additional shares to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes, you may be unable to maintain your pro rata ownership in the Company.\n- 28 -\nOnly a limited trading market exists for our common stock, which could lead to price volatility.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE under the trading symbol \u201cMSL,\u201d but there is low trading volume in our common stock. The limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which might occur in a more active trading market of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, even if a more active market in our common stock develops, we cannot assure you that such a market will continue.\nOur directors and executive management own a significant number of shares of stock, allowing further control over business and corporate affairs.\nOur directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 1.1 million shares, or 6.7%, of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. As a result, in addition to their day-to-day management roles, they will be able to exercise significant influence on our business as stockholders, including influence over election of the Board and the authorization of other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval. In deciding on how to vote on certain proposals, our stockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, Louisiana law, and state and federal banking regulations could delay or prevent a takeover by a third party.\nOur articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay, defer, or prevent a third party takeover, despite possible benefit to the stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our governing documents:\n\u2022\npermit directors to be removed by stockholders only for cause and only upon an 80% vote;\n\u2022\nrequire 80% of the voting power for stockholders to amend the by-laws, call a special meeting, or amend the articles of incorporation, in each case if the proposed action was not approved by the Board;\n\u2022\nauthorize a class of preferred stock that may be issued in series with terms, including voting rights, established by the Board without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nauthorize approximately 30 million shares of common stock and 5 million shares of preferred stock that may be issued by the Board without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nclassify our Board with staggered three year terms, preventing a change in a majority of the Board at any annual meeting;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice of proposed nominations for election to the Board and business to be conducted at a shareholder meeting; and\n\u2022\nrequire 80% of the voting power for stockholders to approve business combinations not approved by the Board.\nThese provisions would likely preclude a third party from removing incumbent directors and simultaneously gaining control of the Board by filling the vacancies thus created with its own nominees. Under the classified Board provisions, it would take at least two elections of directors for any individual or group to gain control of the Board. Accordingly, these provisions could discourage a third party from initiating a proxy contest, making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control. These provisions may have the effect of delaying consideration of a shareholder proposal until the next annual meeting unless a special meeting is called by the Board or the chairman of the Board. Moreover, even in the absence of an attempted takeover, the provisions make it difficult for stockholders dissatisfied with the Board to effect a change in the Board\u2019s composition, even at annual meetings.\nA shareholder\u2019s investment is not an insured deposit.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Your investment in our common stock will be subject to investment risk and you may lose all or part of your investment.", "PERMNO": 79131, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MSL"}
