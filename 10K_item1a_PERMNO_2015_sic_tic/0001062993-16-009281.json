{"cik": "1383097", "company": "NAKED BRAND GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our company or future operations.\nWe are still in the initial stages of our business plan. As a result, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to operate the business successfully. For the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues were $1,389,414 and $557,212, respectively. Naked commenced operations in 2010 and, since beginning operations, we have generated limited total revenues. As a relatively new company, we are subject to many risks associated with the initial organization, financing, expenditures and impediments inherent in a new business and there is limited history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful.\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow that may continue into the foreseeable future. If we fail to execute our strategy to achieve and maintain profitability in the future, investors could lose confidence in the value of our common stock, which could cause our stock price to decline and adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Investors should evaluate an investment in our company in light of the obstacles that may be encountered by a start-up company in a competitive market.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.\nThe operation of our business and our growth efforts will require significant cash outlays. We are largely dependent on outside capital to implement our business plan and support our operations. We anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our growth efforts, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely, in which case, you may lose all your investment. Financings, including future equity investments, if obtained, may be on terms that are dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price at which you purchase your shares. Furthermore, the terms of securities issued in a financing, if obtained, may be more favorable for new investors.\nInvestors should be aware that the value of an investment in our company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment in our company will fully reflect its underlying value.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to pay our outstanding secured debt.\nWe currently have outstanding secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $600,000 that are accruing interest at a rate of 6% per annum. These notes are due on October 1, 2016. The principal amounts, and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are convertible into common stock at any time at the option of the lenders at a conversion price of $10.00 per share. We currently intend to repay these notes on or before their maturity date. However, our ability to repay these notes depends on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate cash flows from our business to repay the notes, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of such indebtedness, sell assets or obtain additional financing in order to repay these notes. In the event that we do not have sufficient funds available to repay the notes at maturity or if we fail to agree upon an alternative arrangement with the lenders, we will be in default on the notes and the lenders may pursue their rights to enforce their security interest in the assets of the Company. Such an event would likely have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and the market value of our shares. Further, there has been no independent valuation of the collateral, and we make no representations as to the amount of such value, and if the collateral were liquidated, whether it would satisfy this indebtedness.\nOur auditors\u2019 report on our January 31, 2016 consolidated financial statements included an explanatory paragraph regarding there being substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $19,063,399. We anticipate generating losses for at least the next 12 months. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue operations in the future as a going concern, as highlighted by our auditors with respect to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2016. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in our company.\nWe have a concentration of sales to key customers and any substantial reduction in sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2016, sales were heavily concentrated with Nordstrom, which accounted for 41% of our net sales. In fiscal 2015, Nordstrom accounted for 28% of our sales. Nordstrom is currently of key importance to our business and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if this relationship ceased. Although we have diversified our customers and continue to receive increasing sales orders from existing customers, Nordstrom does not have any ongoing purchase commitment agreement with us; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the volume of sales will remain consistent going forward. Any substantial change in purchasing decisions by Nordstrom, whether due to actions by our competitors, industry factors or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenue and profitability.\nThe market for innerwear products is highly competitive. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or lost market share or a failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers of innerwear products, including large, diversified companies with substantial market share and strong worldwide brand recognition, such as Calvin Klein, Polo Ralph Lauren, 2(x)ist, Hugo Boss, Tommy John, Saxx Giorgio Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, DKNY, Natori, Free People, Hanky Panky, Commando, Cosabella, MeUndies, Bread&Boxers, Frigo and others. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. Many of our competitors promote their brands through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity endorsements, and have greater and substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we can by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as catalog sales or an extensive franchise network, as opposed to distribution through retail stores, wholesale or internet, and many of our competitors have substantial resources to devote toward increasing sales in such ways.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. We may be unable to introduce new products in a timely manner. Our customers may not accept our new products including our recently launched women\u2019s products, or our competitors may introduce similar products in a more timely fashion. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. Our failure to effectively introduce new products that are accepted by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain our endorsements by professional athletes and celebrities, our ability to market and sell our products may be harmed.\nAn important element of our marketing strategy may be to obtain endorsements from prominent athletes and celebrities, which contribute to the image of our brands. To date, we have entered into one celebrity endorsement agreement with Dwyane Wade, an NBA basketball player. We believe that this strategy will be an effective means of gaining brand exposure worldwide and creating broad appeal for our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with Dwyane Wade and other individuals in the future or that we will be able to attract new athletes and celebrities to endorse our products. We also are subject to risks related to the selection of athletes and celebrities whom we choose to endorse our products. We may select athletes who are unable to perform at expected levels or who are not sufficiently marketable. In addition, negative publicity concerning any of our athletes and celebrities could harm our brand and adversely impact our business. If we are unable in the future to secure prominent athletes and celebrities and arrange endorsements of our products on terms we deem to be reasonable, we may be required to modify our marketing platform and to rely more heavily on other forms of marketing and promotion, which may not prove to be effective. In any event, our inability to obtain endorsements from professional athletes and celebrities could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products, resulting in loss of revenues and a loss of profitability.\nAn economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nMany of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, particularly those in the United States, and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability of consumer credit, levels of unemployment, tax rates and the cost of consumer credit. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. The current volatility in the United States economy in particular has resulted in an overall slowing in growth in the retail sector because of decreased consumer spending, which may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. These unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchase of our products. Consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets, or may decline, when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets, particularly in North America. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur sales and profitability may decline as a result of increasing product costs and decreasing selling prices.\nOur business is subject to significant pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including intense competition, constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressure, pressure from consumers to reduce the prices we charge for our products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to experience increased costs, reduce our sales prices to consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions, operating results and cash flows.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products of our competitors, our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products, product introductions by competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale in our stores or for delivery to customers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could impair the strength and exclusivity of our brand. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in damage to our reputation and customer relationships.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over them and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.\nWe do not manufacture our products or the raw materials for them and rely instead on third-party suppliers. Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed and manufactured by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a very limited number of sources. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional suppliers of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from other participants in our supply chain. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term. We have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards. In that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenue resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. If defects in the manufacture of our products are not discovered until after our customers purchase such products, our customers could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products and our results of operations could suffer and our business could be harmed.\nThe fluctuating cost of raw materials could increase our cost of goods sold and cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nThe fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers include synthetic fabrics whose raw materials include petroleum-based products. Our products also include natural fibers, including cotton. Our costs for raw materials are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Increases in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur ability to source our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome.\nThe United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels. Countries impose, modify and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenue from operations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant seasonal variations in our net revenue from operations. Seasonal variations in our net revenue are primarily related to increased sales of our products during our fiscal fourth quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, net revenue and profits contributed by new retailers; increases or decreases in comparable sales; changes in our product mix; and the timing of new advertising and new product introductions.\nAs a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nWe began selling our products in Canada in January 2010. Our limited operating history and nature as a developing company make it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business or whether or not our business is susceptible to cyclical fluctuations in the economy in the markets in which we operate. Likewise, our growth may have obscured the effect of any seasonal or cyclical factors on our business to date. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our business may become more pronounced over time and may harm our results of operations in the future.\nAny future seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. Disappointing quarterly results could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Seasonal or quarterly factors in our business and results of operations may also make it more difficult for market analysts and investors to assess the longer-term strength of our business at any particular point, which could lead to increased volatility in our stock price. Increased volatility could cause our stock price to suffer in comparison to less volatile investments.\nIf we are unable to adequately demonstrate that our independent manufacturers use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nOur core values, which include developing the highest quality products while operating with integrity, are an important component of our brand image, which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility, fair wage practices, and compliance with child labor laws, among others, and we, along with a third party that we retain for this purpose, monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations. Violation of labor or other laws by our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, Canada or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our merchandise if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. Other apparel manufacturers have encountered significant problems in this regard, and these problems have resulted in organized boycotts of their products and significant adverse publicity. If we, or other manufacturers in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, stock price and results of operations.\nOur limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new international markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nOur future growth depends, to an extent, on our international expansion efforts. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any new market. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into new international markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products by customers in these new international markets. Our failure to develop new international markets or disappointing growth outside of existing markets will harm our business and results of operations.\nOur current operations in international markets and our efforts to expand into additional international markets, and any earnings in those markets, may be affected by legal and regulatory risks.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-corruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate and manufacture our products. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of the Naked brand. The Naked name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. We rely on social media as one of our marketing strategies to have a positive impact on both our brand value and reputation. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers or manufacturers could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers or manufacturing sources. Additionally, while we devote considerable efforts and resources to protecting our intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAny material disruption of our information systems could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe rely on information systems to operate our e-commerce website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, system failures, viruses, cyber-attack or other causes, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. If changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or become obsolete, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems, and we could endure delays in our operations.\nIf we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information, including personal information about our customers, and process payment transactions through our information systems. Although we endeavor to protect confidential information and payment information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our customers, employees and other third parties. Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our customers, employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as well as increased costs such as organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach. We are not aware of that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors.\nThe intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is therefore limited and we currently own no patents or exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics or processes underlying our products. As a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics, fabrics and styling similar to our products. Because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenue and profitability could suffer.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe currently rely on trademarks, as well as confidentiality procedures, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States, Canada or the European Union, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Carole Hochman. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to retain existing personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to our customer and employee relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nBecause a portion of our sales may be generated in foreign countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the US dollar. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue in foreign countries, and changes in exchange rates between the currencies for those countries and the US dollar may have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the currencies for those countries. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock and Public Reporting Requirements\nWhile we believe we have taken the steps necessary to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to successfully address or prevent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure and other requirements may be adversely affected.\nOur management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 related to inadequate security and restricted access to computer systems, including insufficient disaster recovery plans (see \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d in this Form 10-K). As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that, as of January 31, 2016, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe can give no assurances that the measures we take to remediate material weaknesses that we identified will be successful, or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future.\nAny material weakness or other deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis and to comply with disclosure obligations or cause our consolidated financial statements to contain material misstatements, which could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Investors relying upon our consolidated financial statements may make a misinformed investment decision.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution in the future.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 11,250,000 shares of common stock, of which 6,069,982 shares are issued and outstanding as of April 28, 2016. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Previously, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB marketplace operated by the OTC Markets Group. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on stock exchanges like the NASDAQ Capital Market. Although we believe that the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market will improve the liquidity of our common stock, our trading volume may not improve, our volatility may not be reduced and our share price may not stabilize. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling shares of our common stock.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and such other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nThe exercise of outstanding options and warrants, as well as the conversion of convertible debt instruments, may have a dilutive effect on the price of our common stock.\nTo the extent that outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised and convertible debt instruments are converted into shares of our common stock, dilution to our stockholders will occur. Moreover, the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected, since the holders of the outstanding options, warrants and convertible debt instruments can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than the exercise terms provided by the outstanding options, warrants or convertible debt instruments. At April 28, 2016, the total dilutive securities outstanding, including options, warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments was 3,898,972 shares of common stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.\nWe are a former \u201cshell company\u201d and as such are subject to certain limitations not applicable to other public companies generally.\nPrior to our acquisition of Naked Inc. in June 2012, we were a public reporting \u201cshell company,\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Although we are no longer a \u201cshell company,\u201d we are subject to certain restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the resale of securities issued by issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. Specifically, the Rule 144 safe harbor available for the resale of our restricted securities is only available to our stockholders if we have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding twelve months, other than current reports on Form 8-K, at the time of the proposed sale, regardless of whether the restricted securities were initially issued at the time we were a shell company or subsequent to termination of such status. Accordingly, holders of our \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 will be subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 144 with respect to our company. Other reporting companies that are not former shell companies and have been reporting for more than twelve months are not subject to this same reporting threshold for non-affiliate reliance on Rule 144.\nAccordingly, any restricted securities we have sold or sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, may not be resold unless such securities are registered with the SEC or the requirements of Rule 144 have been satisfied. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our employees and consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it may be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our prior status as a \u201cshell company\u201d could prevent us in the future from raising additional funds, engaging employees and consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions, which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.\nFurther, as current and former shell companies and reverse acquisition transactions have been, and remain to some degree, subject to additional scrutiny by the SEC, FINRA and the national securities exchanges, our prior shell company status and the reverse acquisition transaction that terminated it may result in delays in the completion of any offering and our attempt to qualify for and list on a national securities exchange. Specifically, as a former shell company and subject of a reverse acquisition transaction, we may need to demonstrate the ability to maintain a threshold per share market price for an extended trading period in order to qualify for listing on a national securities exchange.\nWe will incur significantly-increased costs as a result of and devote substantial management time to operating as a newly-listed company on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAs a newly-listed company on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur before when our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace. For example, we will be subject to the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the NASDAQ Capital Market, including changes in corporate governance practices. These requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will render some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these listing requirements.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part upon the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15905, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "NAKD.1"}
