{"cik": "1220754", "company": "PROVIDENCE SERVICE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that our contracts will survive until the end of their stated terms, or that upon their expiration will be renewed or extended on satisfactory terms, if at all. Disruptions to, the early expiration of, or the failure to renew our contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur NET Services contracts are subject to frequent renewal. For example, many of our state Medicaid contracts, which represented 48.7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, have terms ranging from three to five years and are typically subject to a competitive bidding process near the end of the term. We also contract with MCOs, which represented 51.3% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. MCO contracts typically continue until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice in accordance with the terms of the contract. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent we will be successful in renewing our state Medicaid contracts or retaining our MCO contracts. As of December 31, 2019, 20.8% of our revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that are subject to renewal within the next 12 months. Renewed contracts represented 12.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, with respect to many of our state contracts, the payor may terminate the contract without cause, or for convenience, at will and without penalty to the payor, either immediately or upon the expiration of a short notice period in the event that, among other reasons, government appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated.\nWe cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a payor might terminate its contract with us prior to its expiration, or fail to renew or extend a contract with us. If we are unable to retain or renew our contracts, or replace lost contracts, on satisfactory terms our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. While we pursue new contract awards and also undertake efficiency measures, there can be no assurance that such measures will fully offset the impact of contracts that are not renewed or are canceled on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our business through responses to government requests for proposals and we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future, or contracts we are awarded may not be profitable.\nWe obtain, and will continue to seek to obtain, a significant portion of our business from state government entities, which generally entails responding to a government request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d). To propose effectively, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and submit the most attractive proposal with respect to both technical and price specifications. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables. Our ability to respond successfully to an RFP will greatly affect our business. If we misinterpret bid requirements as to performance criteria or do not accurately estimate performance costs in a binding bid for an RFP, we will seek to correct such mistakes in the final contract. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to modify the proposed contract and we may be required to perform under a contract that is not profitable.\nIf we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, we could be liable for damages and financial penalties, which may place existing pledged performance and payment bonds at risk as well as harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts and future bonds.\nOur failure to comply with our contractual obligations could, in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause, negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain current contracts or obtain new contracts. The termination of a contract for cause could, for instance, subject us to liabilities for excess costs incurred by a payor in obtaining similar services from another source. In addition, our contracts require us to indemnify payors for our failure to meet standards of care, and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties if we breach these contracts, which amounts could be material. For example, we have a minimum volume commitment under one of our transportation-related contracts. To the\nextent our actual use is less than the minimum commitment for a specified period, we may be subject to significant expense, without the benefit of corresponding revenue. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum penalty we would incur if we do not meet our minimum volume commitment over the remaining term of the agreement is $6.0 million. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential financial damages.\nAny acquisition or integration that we undertake could disrupt our business, not generate anticipated results, dilute stockholder value or have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur growth strategy involves the evaluation of potential entry into complementary markets and service lines through acquisition, particularly with opportunities that may leverage the advantages inherent in our large-scale technology-enabled operations and networks. We have made acquisitions and anticipate that we will continue to consider and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities the success of which depends in part on our ability to integrate an acquired company into our business operations. For example, we completed the acquisition of Circulation in September 2018 and as a result, we terminated the development of our legacy LCAD NextGen technology (\u201cNextGen\u201d), resulting in an impairment charge of $14.2 million in 2018. Integration of any acquired company will place significant demands on our management, systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. This could require us to incur significant expense for, among other things, hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. The nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find. Our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that the companies we acquire will generate income or incur expenses at the historical or projected levels on which we based our acquisition decisions, that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies\u2019 contracts, that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe expect to continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services, expand our markets or otherwise offer prospects for growth. In connection with our acquisition strategy, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or we could incur or assume substantial debt or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 challenges and unanticipated costs assimilating the acquired operations;\n\u2022 known and unknown legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers;\n\u2022 entering markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations;\n\u2022 incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition;\n\u2022 failure to maintain and renew contracts and other revenue streams of the acquired business;\n\u2022 costs associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u2022 unanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition; and\n\u2022 dilution to our earnings per share.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition or integration and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of any strategic initiatives that are adopted by the Company.\nFrom time to time we may launch strategic initiatives designed to enhance shareholder value. Such strategic initiatives may require considerable time and resources; however, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these strategic initiatives, including the current initiative to expand our Circulation technology platform.\nOur investments in any joint ventures and unconsolidated entities could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our joint venture partner's financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partner and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partner.\nWe currently hold a non-controlling interest in Matrix, which constitutes 21.9% of our consolidated assets. We do not\nhave unilateral power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such business\u2019 economic performance. Our future growth may depend, in part, on future similar arrangements, any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. These arrangements involve risks not present with respect to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations or make the arrangements less successful than anticipated, including the following:\n\u2022we may be unable to take actions that we believe are appropriate but are opposed by our joint venture partner under arrangements that require us to cede or share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the business or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the business;\n\u2022our joint venture partner may take actions that we oppose;\n\u2022we may be unable to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party if we fail to obtain the prior consent of our joint venture partner;\n\u2022our joint venture partner may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which could adversely impact the joint venture or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture;\n\u2022our joint venture partner may have business interests or goals with respect to a business that conflict with our business interests and goals, including with respect to the timing, terms and strategies for investment, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the business;\n\u2022disagreements with our joint venture partner could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors, and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the business, including the delay of important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and\n\u2022we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partner with respect to our joint venture investment.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few payors, which puts our financial condition and results of operations at risk. Any changes in the funding, financial viability or our relationships with these payors could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate a significant amount of our revenue from a few payors under a small number of contracts. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we generated 47.6%, 51.4%, and 52.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue from ten payors. Additionally, the top five payors represented, in the aggregate, 32.4%, 34.0%, and 36.1%, respectively, of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Furthermore, a single payor related to Matrix represented 29.2%, 31.5%, and 30.9% of Matrix revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of, reduction in amounts generated by, or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services under these contracts could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. In addition, any consolidation of any of our private payors could increase the impact that any such risks would have on our revenue, financial position, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts, we may experience reduced or negative margins.\nDuring 2019, 2018 and 2017, 84.6%, 79.2%, and 77.9% of our revenue, respectively, was generated under capitated contracts with the remainder generated through FFS and flat fee contracts. Under most of our capitated contracts, we assume the responsibility of managing the needs of a specific geographic population by contracting out transportation services to local transportation companies on a per ride or per mile basis. We use \u201cpricing models\u201d to determine applicable contract rates, which take into account factors such as estimated utilization, state specific data, previous experience in the state or with similar services, the medically covered programs outlined in the contract, identified populations to be serviced, estimated volume, estimated transportation provider rates and availability of mass transit. The amount of the fixed per-member, monthly fee is determined in the bidding process, but is predicated on actual historical transportation data for the subject geographic region as provided by the payor, actuarial work performed in-house as well as by third party actuarial firms and actuarial analysis provided by the payor. If the utilization of our services is more than we estimated, the contract may be less profitable than anticipated, or may not be profitable at all. Under our FFS contracts, we receive fees based on our interactions with government-sponsored clients. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services. Our risk relating to these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs, such as rent and overhead. Our FFS contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore, if we fail to estimate our costs accurately, we may experience reduced margins or losses on these contracts. Revenue under certain contracts may be adjusted prospectively if client volumes are below expectations. If we are unable to adjust our costs accordingly, our profitability may be negatively affected. In addition, certain contracts with state Medicaid agencies are renewable or extended at the state\u2019s option without an adjustment to pricing terms. If such renewed contracts require us to incur higher costs, including inflation or regulatory changes, than originally anticipated, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur costs before receiving related revenues, which affect our liquidity.\nWhen we are awarded a contract to provide services, we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments. These expenses include leasing office space, purchasing office equipment, instituting information technology systems, development of supply chains and hiring personnel. As a result, in certain contracts where the payor does not fund program start-up costs, we may be required to make significant investments before receiving any related contract payments or payments sufficient to cover start-up costs. In addition, payments due to us from payors may be delayed due to billing cycles, which may adversely affect our liquidity. Moreover, any resulting mismatch in expenses and revenue could be exacerbated if we fail either to invoice the payor correctly or to collect our fee in a timely manner. Such amounts may exceed our available cash, and any resulting liquidity shortages may require additional financing, which may not be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. This could have a material adverse impact on our ongoing operations and our financial position.\nOur business is subject to risks of litigation.\nThe services we provide are subject to lawsuits and claims. A substantial award payable by us could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows, and could adversely affect our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance. We can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct, in addition to professional liability type claims, by an employee or a third party we engage to assist with the provision of services, including but not limited to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions, CHAs performed by Matrix, and various claims that could result from employees or contracted third parties driving to or from interactions with clients or while providing direct client services. We can be subject to employee-related claims such as wrongful discharge, discrimination or a violation of equal employment laws and permitting issues. While we attempt to insure against these types of claims, damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage, such as a claim for fraud, certain wage and hour violations or punitive damages, could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if the drivers we engage as independent contractors were instead classified as employees.\nWe believe that the drivers we engage to provide rider benefits are properly classified as independent contractors and that these drivers are not our employees. Changes to federal, state or local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial or administrative challenges to our classification of these drivers as independent contractors, could affect the status of these drivers as independent contractors. A change in the classification of these drivers from independent contractors to employees could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to attracting and retaining qualified employees and labor relations.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to identify, attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high-quality services to our clients, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is a significant consideration when we evaluate the education, experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff. A portion of our staff is professionals with requisite educational backgrounds and professional certifications. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, our ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition and a larger number of clients and payors than we do, which may prove more attractive to employment candidates. The inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe performance of our business also depends on the talents and efforts of our highly skilled information technology professionals. Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate these individuals.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior\nmanagement knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management, our ability to execute short and long-term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.\nWe may have difficulty successfully completing divestitures or exiting businesses\nAs demonstrated most recently with the WD Services sale in 2018 and various other transactions involving WD Services, as well as the sale of a controlling interest in Matrix in 2016, we may dispose of all or a portion of our investments or exit businesses based on a variety of factors, including availability of alternative opportunities to deploy capital or otherwise maximize shareholder value as well as other strategic considerations. A divestiture or business termination could result in difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees and customers. A divestiture or business termination may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the disposition or business termination, whether or not the disposition or business termination has been publicly announced. A divestiture or business termination may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, including continuing obligations to employees, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our financial position and results of operations. Further, such divestitures may result in proceeds to us in an amount less than we expect or less than our assessment of the value of those assets. Any sale of our assets could result in a loss on divestiture. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold companies may result in liabilities.\nWe rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. However, the liability of the former owners is limited under the relevant acquisition agreements, and certain sellers may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our divested operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have provided certain indemnifications in connection with the WD Services sale in 2018, the Matrix Transaction in 2016 and the Human Services Sale in 2015. To the extent we choose to divest other operations of our businesses in the future, we expect to provide certain indemnifications in connection with these divestitures. We may face liabilities in connection with these current or future indemnification obligations that may adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.\nWe compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services. Many organizations of varying sizes compete with us, including local not-for-profit organizations and community-based organizations, larger companies, organizations that currently provide or may begin to provide similar NET management services (including transportation network companies such as Uber and Lyft) and CHA providers. Some of these companies may have greater financial, technical, political, marketing, name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients or payors than we do. In addition, some of these companies offer more services than we do. To remain competitive, we must provide superior services and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers.\nThe market in which we operate is influenced by technological developments that affect cost-efficiency and quality of services, and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services that address these changing needs and to provide technology needed to deliver these services on a cost-effective basis. Our competitors may better utilize technology to change the way services in our industry are designed and delivered and they may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities than we can provide, including better contract terms, technical qualifications, price and availability of qualified professional personnel. In addition, new or disruptive technologies and methodologies by our competitors may make our services uncompetitive.\nIn conjunction with our ongoing efforts to improve cost-efficiency and the customer experience, in September 2018, we completed our acquisition of Circulation. We incurred costs associated with such acquisition and will also incur costs as we\ncontinue to implement the Circulation Select technology across LogistiCare\u2019s existing operations, but there is no guarantee that this will ultimately serve our business purposes or result in lower costs or improved customer experience.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into the markets in which we operate. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of or failure to gain clients or payors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our business may also be adversely affected by the consolidation of competitors, which may result in increased pricing pressure or negotiating leverage with payors, or by the provision of our services by payors or clients directly, including through the acquisition of competitors.\nWe may be adversely affected by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations and we must implement and maintain appropriate and sufficient infrastructure and systems to support growth and business processes. We provide services to individuals, including services that require us to collect, process and maintain sensitive and personal client information, including information relating to their health, identification numbers and other personal data. As a result, we are subject to complex and evolving U.S. privacy laws and regulations, including those pertaining to the handling of personal data, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"). Government authorities around the world are considering, or are in the process of implementing, new data protection regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. For example, the CCPA recently went into effect on January 1, 2020, and affords California residents and households expanded privacy protections. The recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, while we are using internal and external resources to monitor compliance with and to continue to modify our data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. In addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data. Improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could adversely affect our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all other functions, including our marketing, sales, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. Further, our systems include interfaces to third-party stakeholders, often connected via the Internet. In addition, certain of our services or information related to our services are carried out or hosted within our customers\u2019 IT systems, and any failure or weaknesses in their IT systems may negatively impact our ability to deliver the services, for which we may not receive relief from contractual performance obligations or compensation for services provided. As a result of the data we maintain and third-party access, we are subject to increasing cybersecurity risks. The nature of our business, where services are often performed outside of locations where network security can be assured, adds additional risk.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, computer hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks and our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, employee or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures sufficient to prevent a breach of our systems and protect sensitive data. Any breach of our data security could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. A failure to prevent, detect and respond in a timely manner to a major breach of our data security or to other cybersecurity threats could result in system disruption, business continuity issues or compromised data integrity. These events or any other failure to safeguard personal data could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach. If we are unable to prevent material failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs, a requirement not to operate our business until defects are remedied or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations, any of which could\ndetrimentally affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to protect our client\u2019s privacy and confidential information could lead to legal liability, adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe retain confidential information in our computer systems, including personal information about our end users, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, identification numbers and payment account information. Malicious cyber- attacks to gain access to personal information affect many companies across various industries, including ours. Pursuant to federal and state laws, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, most states have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. An increasing number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Any compromise of the security of our systems that results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer or employee information or inadvertent disclosure of any clients\u2019 personal information could damage our reputation, deter people from using our services, expose us to litigation, increase regulatory scrutiny and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses. In addition, data breaches impacting other companies, such as our vendors, may allow cybercriminals to obtain personally identifiable information about our customers. Cybercriminals may then use this information to, among other things, attempt to gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to maintain or to develop further reliable, efficient and secure information technology systems would be disruptive to our operations and diminish our ability to compete and grow our business successfully.\nWe are highly dependent on efficient and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and business systems. These systems quote, process and service our business, and perform financial functions necessary for pricing and service delivery. These systems must also be able to undergo periodic modifications and improvements without interruptions or untimely delays in service. Additionally, our ability to integrate our systems with those of our clients is critical to our success. Our information systems rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources to maintain and enhance existing systems as well as develop and create new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory requirements. However, we still rely on manual processes and procedures, including accounting, reporting and consolidation processes that may result in errors and may not scale proportionately with our business growth.\nA failure or delay to achieve improvements in our information technology platforms could interrupt certain processes or degrade business operations and could place us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to implement appropriate systems, procedures and controls, we may not be able to successfully offer our services and grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations will continue to fluctuate due to seasonality.\nOur operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business. Due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter months, we normally experience lower operating margins in the summer and higher operating margins in the winter.\nOur reported financial results could suffer if there is an impairment of long-lived assets.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to review the carrying value of long-lived assets to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may be impaired. Factors that may necessitate an impairment assessment include, among others, significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, significant adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or significant declines in the observable market value of an asset. Where the presence or occurrence of those events indicates that an asset may be impaired, we assess its recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the asset. If such testing indicates the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. If the fair value of those assets is less than carrying value, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our intangible assets may result in different values for those assets, which could\nresult in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. For example, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $14.2 million in 2018 related to NextGen.\nIn addition, goodwill may be impaired if the estimated fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. As a result of our growth, in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. For example, goodwill generated in relation to the acquisition of Circulation in 2018 was $40.0 million. We perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis. Interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value, including goodwill, of our reporting unit below the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value. Such circumstances could include but are not limited to: (1) loss of significant contracts, (2) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business, (3) unanticipated competition, (4) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or (5) a significant decline in our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill, intangibles and property and equipment, net was $135.2 million, $19.9 million and $23.2 million, respectively. We continue to monitor the carrying value of these long-lived assets. If future conditions are different from management\u2019s estimates at the time of an acquisition or market conditions change subsequently, we may incur future charges for impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets, or property and equipment which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur use of a reinsurance program and insurance programs to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business.\nWe reinsured a substantial portion of our automobile, general liability, professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies through May 15, 2017. Upon renewal of the policies, we made the decision to no longer reinsure these risks, although we continue to resolve claims under the historical policy years. Through February 15, 2011, one of our subsidiaries also insured certain general liability, automobile liability, and automobile physical damage coverage for independent third-party transportation providers. In the event that actual reinsured losses increase unexpectedly and substantially exceed actuarially determined estimated reinsured losses under the program, the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, under our current insurance policies, we are subject to deductibles, and thus retain exposure within these limits. In the event that actual losses within our deductible limits increase unexpectedly and substantially exceed our expected losses, the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nAs the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in cost, we will continue to evaluate the levels and types of insurance coverage we include in our reinsurance and self-insurance programs, as well as the deductible limits within our traditional insurance programs. Any increase to these reinsurance and self-insurance programs or increases in deductible limits increases our risk exposure and therefore increases the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nInaccurate, misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to maintain or procure contracts.\nThere is sometimes media coverage regarding services that we or our competitors provide or contracts that we or our competitors are a party to. Inaccurate, misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and, accordingly, our ability to maintain our existing contracts or procure new contracts.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated healthcare industry. Compliance with existing laws is costly, and changes in laws or violations of laws may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state laws relating to, among other things:\n\u2022professional licensure;\n\u2022conduct of operations;\n\u2022addition of facilities, equipment and services, including certificates of need;\n\u2022coding and billing related to our services; and\n\u2022payment for services.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have increased coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts related to the healthcare industry. Regulations related to the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of those laws. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as the attempts to invalidate all or portions of those laws in ongoing legislation, has also introduced some degree of regulatory uncertainty as the industry does not know how the changes it introduced or changes to it will affect many aspects of the industry.\nMedicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse laws prohibit certain business practices and relationships related to items and services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce or arrange for referral of patients or recommendation for the provision of items or services covered by Medicare or Medicaid or any other federal or state healthcare program (referred to as \u201cthe Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil Monetary Penalty Rules Regarding Beneficiary Inducements\u201d). Federal and state laws also prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims, including claims to obtain reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid (referred to as \u201cthe False Claims Act\u201d). We have implemented compliance policies to help assure our compliance with these regulations as they become effective; however, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations in the future could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services or the manner in which we conduct our business.\nChanges in budgetary priorities of the government entities that fund the services we provide could result in the loss of contracts or a decrease in amounts payable to us under our contracts.\nOur revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies. All of these contracts are subject to legislative appropriations and state and/or national budget approval, as well as changes to potential eligibility for services. The availability of funding under our contracts with state governments is dependent in part upon federal funding to states. Changes in Medicaid provider reimbursement and federal matching funds methodologies may further reduce the availability of federal funds to states in which we provide services. CMS has repeatedly invited states to submit requests for waivers to CMS that would allow states to reduce or eliminate the NET benefit for some populations. In response, several states have asked for and received temporary waivers of NET requirements for the Medicaid expansion or non-disabled adult population. In addition, in late 2018, the Office of Management and Budget published in the Unified Agenda DHHS's intention to revise the current regulations under which states are required to provide NET services for all Medicaid beneficiaries. The stated goal of this proposed rule is to provide states with greater flexibility as part of the administration\u2019s reform initiatives. It is possible that revised regulations could be issued in 2020 making it optional for the states to provide NET services to some or all Medicaid beneficiaries. Such changes, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our operations although the extent of such impact is unknowable and will depend on the decisions of each state and, in some circumstances, each Medicaid managed care organization.\nCurrently, many of the U.S. states in which our segments operate are facing budgetary shortfalls or changes in budgetary priorities. While many of these states are dealing with budgetary concerns by shifting costs from institutional care to home and community based care such as we provide, there is no assurance that this trend will continue. In addition, because funding under our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding, such funding changes could have a significant effect upon such segments\u2019 businesses\nConsequently, a significant decline in government expenditures or the number of program beneficiaries, a shift of expenditures or funding away from programs that call for the types of services that we provide, or change in government contracting or funding policies could cause payors to terminate their contracts with us or reduce their expenditures under those contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our financial position and operating results.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to privacy and security of patient and service user information. Failure to comply with privacy and security regulations could result in a material adverse impact on our segments\u2019 operating results.\nThere are numerous federal and state regulations addressing patient information privacy and security concerns. In particular, the federal regulations issued under HIPAA contain provisions that:\n\u2022protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of patient information;\n\u2022require the implementation of security safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form; and\n\u2022prescribe specific transaction formats and data code sets for certain electronic healthcare transactions.\nWe invest considerable time and resources in ensuring compliance with state and federal privacy laws and regulations. These investments could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. Further, the HIPAA regulations and state privacy laws expose us to increased regulatory risk, as the penalties associated with a failure to comply or with information security breaches, even if unintentional, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to actions for false claims or recoupment of funds pursuant to certain audits for non-compliance with government coding and billing rules, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state documentation, coding and billing rules, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties, loss of licenses and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. In billing for our services to third-party clients, we must follow complex documentation, coding and billing rules. These rules are based on federal and state laws, rules and regulations, various government pronouncements, including guidance and notices, and industry practice. Failure to follow these rules could result in potential criminal or civil liability under the federal False Claims Act, under which extensive financial penalties can be imposed or under various state statutes which prohibit the submission of false claims for services covered. Compliance failure could further result in criminal liability under various federal and state criminal or civil statutes. We may be subject to audits conducted by our clients or their proxies, including the Unified Program Integrity Contractors, regional federal program integrity contractors for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, that may result in recoupment of funds. In addition, our clients may be subject to certain audits that may result in recoupment of funds from our clients that may, in turn, implicate us. We could be adversely affected in the event such an audit results in negative findings and recoupment from or penalties to our customers.\nOur contracts are subject to stringent claims and invoice processing regimes which vary depending on the customer and nature of the payment mechanism. Government entities may take the position that if a transport cannot be matched to a medically necessary healthcare event, or is conducted inconsistently with contractual, regulatory or even policy requirements, payment for such transport may be recouped by such customer.\nWhile we carefully and regularly review documentation, and coding and billing practices, the rules are frequently vague and confusing and they cannot ensure that governmental investigators, private insurers or private whistleblowers will not challenge our practices. Such a challenge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to civil penalties and loss of business if we fail to comply with applicable bribery, corruption and other regulations governing business with public organizations.\nWe are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by a federally funded healthcare program. Any of our financial relationships with healthcare providers will be potentially implicated by this statute to the extent Medicare or Medicaid referrals are implicated. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation, imprisonment of up to ten years, civil penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law of up to $100,000 per violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the False Claims Act of up to $22,363 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Any such penalties could have a significant negative effect on our operations. Furthermore, the exclusion could result in significant reductions in our revenues, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute with similar penalties. On October 9, 2019, DHHS published a proposed rule to amend the local transportation safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil Monetary Penalty Rules Regarding Beneficiary Inducements, which, when finalized, may change our compliance requirements. Based on the contents of the proposed rule, our compliance risk will either be reduced or remain unchanged in comparison to current requirements\nChanges to the regulatory landscape applicable to Matrix could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe CHA services industry is primarily regulated by federal and state healthcare laws and the requirements of participation and reimbursement of the MA Program established by CMS. From time to time, CMS considers changes to regulatory guidelines with respect to prospective CHAs or the risk adjusted payment system applicable to Matrix\u2019s MA plan customers. CMS could adopt new requirements or guidelines that may, for example, increase the costs associated with CHAs,\nlimit the opportunities and settings available to administer CHAs, or otherwise change the risk adjusted payment system in a way that would adversely impact our business. Further, changes in or adoption of new state laws governing the scope of practice of mid-level practitioners, or more restrictive interpretations of such laws, may restrict Matrix\u2019s ability to provide services using nurse practitioners. Any such implementation of additional regulations on the CHA industry by CMS or other regulatory bodies or further regulation of mid-level practitioners could have a material adverse impact on Matrix\u2019s revenues and margins, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nAs government contractors, our segments are subject to an increased risk of litigation and other legal actions and liabilities.\nAs government contractors, our segments are subject to an increased risk of investigation, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities that are not as frequently experienced by companies that do not provide government sponsored services. Companies providing government sponsored services can also become involved in public inquiries which can lead to negative media speculation or potential cancellation or termination of contracts. Further, government contract awards are frequently challenged by the losing bidders leading to delays in contract start dates, rebids, or even loss of a previously awarded contract.\nOur business is subject to licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions, including provisions governing surveys and audits. Changes to, or violations of, these regulations could negatively impact us.\nIn many of the locations where we operate, we are required by local laws to obtain and maintain licenses. The applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide, the credentials of staff, record keeping, treatment planning, client monitoring and supervision of staff. The failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on us and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction. Our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payors or clients. We are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations. Such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payors and clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contracts are subject to audit and modification by the payors with whom we contract, at their sole discretion.\nOur businesses depend on our ability to successfully perform under various government funded contracts. Under the terms of these contracts, payors, government agencies or their proxy contractors can review our compliance or performance, as well as our records and general business practices at any time, and may, in their discretion:\n\u2022suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022terminate or modify our existing contracts;\n\u2022reduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts; or\n\u2022audit and object to our contract related fees.\nAny increase in the number or scope of audits could increase our expenses, and the audit process may disrupt the day-to-day operations of our business and distract management. If payors have significant audit findings, or if they make material modifications to our contracts, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.\nWe are subject to income taxation in both the U.S. and, due to our ownership of international entities prior to the WD Services sale, 10 foreign countries, including specific states or provinces where we operate. Our total income tax provision is a function of applicable local tax rates and the geographic mix of our income from continuing and discontinued operations before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix, or foreign exchange rates could reduce our after-tax income.\nOur total income tax provision is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions and related matters. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. In addition, we make judgments regarding the applicability of tax treaties and the appropriate application of transfer pricing regulations. In the event one taxing jurisdiction disagrees with another taxing jurisdiction with respect to the amount or applicability of a particular type of tax, or the amount or availability of a particular type of tax refund or credit, we could experience temporary or permanent double taxation and increased professional fees to resolve such taxation matters.\nOur determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities, and we have been audited by various jurisdictions in prior years. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service as a result of the large refund received from the loss on the WD Services sale. In addition, we are being examined by various states and by the Saudi Arabian tax authorities. Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree. The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from the estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nRestrictive covenants in our Credit Agreement may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe terms contained in the agreements that govern certain of our indebtedness, including our Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, supplemented, or modified, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), and the agreements that govern any future indebtedness of ours, may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our best interest. These agreements, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022make loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022make distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022make acquisitions; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable agreements that govern our indebtedness. Such default may preclude us from drawing from our senior secured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) or allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that we may incur to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nExpiration of existing Credit Facility, loss of available financing or an inability to renew, or refinance our debt could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had no balance outstanding and our available credit under the Credit Facility was $186.5 million. However, the Credit Facility matures on August 2, 2020 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend our current Credit Facility or enter into a new one on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our cash on hand is insufficient, or we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to cover our cash flow and liquidity needs and service our debt, we may be required to seek additional sources of funds, including extending or replacing our maturing Credit Facility, refinancing all or a portion of our existing or future debt, incurring additional debt to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our ongoing operating needs and fund anticipated expenditures. There can be no assurance that any new financing or refinancing will be possible or obtained on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain needed financing, we may (i) be unable to satisfy our ongoing obligations, (ii) be unable to pursue future business opportunities or fund acquisitions, (iii) find it more difficult to fund future operating costs, tax payments or general corporate expenditures and (iv) become vulnerable to adverse general economic, capital markets and industry conditions. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could impair our financial condition.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund activities including but not limited to share repurchases, acquisitions, cash dividends and business expansion. Any existing and future indebtedness increases the risk that\nwe may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of such indebtedness. Future substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022make it more difficult to renew or enter into new contracts with existing and potential future clients;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions;\n\u2022restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as in government regulation and to our business; and\n\u2022expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates.\nOur ability to satisfy and manage our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow and on overall financial market conditions. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on our debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell or curtail assets or operations, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell or curtail our assets or operations, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nOur annual operating results and stock price may be volatile or may decline significantly regardless of our operating performance.\nOur annual operating results and the market price for our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022changes in rates or coverage for services by payors;\n\u2022changes in Medicaid, Medicare or other U.S. federal or state rules, regulations or policies;\n\u2022market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole; including, without limitation, increases in the minimum wage in various jurisdictions in which we operate, and fluctuations in the size of the Medicare member population as well as overall health of its members;\n\u2022increased competition, including through insourcing of services by our clients and new entrants to the market;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events;\n\u2022changes in tax law; and\n\u2022changes in accounting principles.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular, NASDAQ, have experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we become involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nThe Company depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments, if any.\nOur operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet any debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. We do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future; however, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our Common Stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, the agreement governing our Credit Agreement significantly restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict\nour ability to pay dividends to holders of our Common Stock. We do, however, pay cash dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. As of February 24, 2020, we had 13,025,727 outstanding shares of Common Stock which are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless held by or purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Shares of our Common Stock held by or purchased by our affiliates are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but will be eligible for resale subject to applicable volume, means of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAs of December 31, 2019, shares of our Preferred Stock were convertible into 2,002,979 shares of Common Stock. On September 9, 2019, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to (i) 3,145,102 shares of Common Stock, consisting of 1,224,557 shares of Common Stock and 1,920,545 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of shares of Preferred Stock and (ii) 765,916 shares of Preferred Stock, for the sale by Coliseum Capital Co-Invest, L.P., Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P., Coliseum Capital Partners II, L.P. and Blackwell Partners, LLC - Series A (collectively, the \u201cColiseum Stockholders\u201d) of such securities, which was declared effective on September 18, 2019.\nIn August 2016, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to register additional shares of Common Stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of stock options granted under our plans will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates. As of December 31, 2019, there were stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 639,412 shares of our Common Stock and there were 90,189 shares of our Common Stock subject to restricted stock awards. In addition, 1,306,243 shares of our Common Stock are reserved for future issuances under the plan.\nThe terms of our Preferred Stock contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to conduct business and we may not be able to maintain compliance with the obligations under our outstanding Preferred Stock which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position, and our stock price.\nOn February 11, 2015 and March 12, 2015, we issued $65.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of Preferred Stock. The terms of the Preferred Stock require us to pay mandatory quarterly dividends, either in cash or through an increase in the stated principal value of such stock. Our ability to satisfy and manage our obligations under our outstanding Preferred Stock depends, in part, on our ability to generate cash flow and on overall financial market conditions. Additionally, the terms of our Preferred Stock contain operating and financial covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters. Among other things, these covenants, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, restrict our ability to incur additional debt, sell or otherwise dispose of our assets, make acquisitions, and merge or consolidate with other entities. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position, and our stock price.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities that would rank senior to our Common Stock, may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our Common Stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Common Stock and may result in dilution to owners of our Common Stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot\npredict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our Common Stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Common Stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position, and our stock price.\nWe are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements, under the listing standards of NASDAQ and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), that apply to issuers of listed equity, which impose certain significant compliance costs and obligations upon us. Being a publicly listed company requires a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight resulting in increased operating costs. These requirements also place additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. Additionally, as a public company, we are required, among other things, to define and expand the roles and the duties of our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and its committees and institute more comprehensive compliance and investor relations functions.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. Preparing our consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and require significant management judgment. One or more of these elements may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. If a material misstatement occurs in the future, we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations. For example, we may fail to file periodic reports in a timely manner or may need to restate our financial results, either of which may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf the accounting estimates we make, and the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may be adversely affected.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about, among other things, taxes, revenue recognition, contingent obligations, transportation expense, recoverability of long-lived assets and doubtful accounts. These estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. If our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct, we may need to accrue additional charges or reduce the value of assets that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, leading to a loss in investor confidence in our ability to manage our business and our stock price could decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, including provisions governing when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, in the event of certain change of control transactions, holders of Preferred Stock may be entitled under the governing certificate of designations to be paid both (i) the liquidation preference per share then in effect plus certain unpaid dividends and (ii) a pro rata portion of the transaction consideration on an as-converted basis. As a result of these provisions, holders of our Common Stock may not receive the full benefit of any premium to the market price of our Common Stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context.\nEven in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.\nWe currently do not expect to declare and pay dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, invest in our technology, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your Common Stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our Common Stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our Common Stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 89824, "SIC": 4100, "TIC": "PRSC"}
