RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\nCertain statements contained in, or incorporated by reference in, this report are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d and similar words or expressions. The Company\u2019s forward-looking statements include certain information relating to general business strategy, growth strategies, financial results, liquidity, product development, the introduction of new products, the enhancement of existing products, the potential markets and uses for the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s regulatory filings with the FDA, acquisitions, the development of joint venture opportunities, intellectual property and patent protection and infringement, the loss of revenue due to the expiration on termination of certain agreements, the effect of competition on the structure of the markets in which the Company competes, increased legal, accounting and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, the Company's ability to continue to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, defending the Company in litigation matters and the Company\u2019s cost-saving initiatives. The reader must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by assumptions that fail to materialize as anticipated. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may vary materially. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors affecting the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements, and the reader therefore should not consider the following list of risk factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions.\nThe Company cautions the reader to consider carefully these factors as well as the specific factors discussed with each specific forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K annual report and in the Company\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). In some cases, these factors have impacted, and in the future (together with other unknown factors) could impact, the Company\u2019s ability to implement the Company\u2019s business strategy and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Any expectation, estimate or projection contained in a forward-looking statement may not be achieved.\nThe Company also cautions the reader that forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, but investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by the Company on this subject in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Although it is not possible to create a comprehensive list of all factors that may cause actual results to differ from the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements, the material factors include, without limitation, the following:\nDue to the Company\u2019s history of operating losses, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is uncertain that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The report of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm issued in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph indicating that certain matters (see footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company cannot guarantee that it can generate net income, increase revenues or successfully expand its operations in the future, and if it cannot do so, the Company may not be able to survive and any investment in the Company may be lost.\nThe Company has implemented an austerity plan to stem the recurring losses. If the Company is unable to achieve improvement in this area in the near term, it is not likely that the Company\u2019s existing cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund activities throughout the next six to 12 months without curtailing certain business activities or selling certain assets. The Company\u2019s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of other factors, including the factors discussed in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThis going concern disclosure could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future or to obtain any additional financing if needed. If the Company seeks to raise funds in the future, it may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements at prices or other terms that may not be as favorable as they would absent such qualification. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.\nAny acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures that the Company effects, if any, could result in financial results that differ from market expectations.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company engages in discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. As a result of any such transactions, of which the Company cannot assure that any will occur, the Company\u2019s financial results may differ from the investment community\u2019s expectations in a given quarter. In addition, acquisitions and alliances may require the Company to integrate a different company culture, management team, business infrastructure, accounting systems and financial reporting systems. The Company may not be able to effect any such acquisitions or alliances. The Company may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired business in a way that enhances the performance of the Company\u2019s combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from any expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, the Company\u2019s successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including the retention of key employees and the management of facilities and employees in separate geographical areas. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert the Company\u2019s attention from other business operations. Also, the Company\u2019s results may be adversely impacted because of acquisition-related costs, amortization costs for certain intangible assets and impairment losses related to goodwill in connection with such transactions. Finally, acquisitions or alliances by the Company may not occur, which could impair the Company\u2019s growth.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Escalon Medical Corp. (\u201cEscalon\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and is hampered by the transition to new products which involved the discounting of our older product inventory and a material exchange rate reduction between the Euro and the US Dollar.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The 2016 consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent on its future profitability and on the on-going support of its shareholders, affiliates and creditors. In order to mitigate the going concern issues, the Company is actively pursuing business partnerships, managing our continuing operations, and seeking to sell certain assets. The Company may not be successful in any of these efforts.\nThe Company\u2019s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. If the Company raises funds in the future, the Company may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements at prices and other terms that my not be as favorable as they would without such qualification. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nThe Company has experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates continued fluctuations in the future. A number of factors contribute to these fluctuations:\n\u2022\nThe timing and expense of new product introductions by the Company or its competitors, although the Company might not successfully develop new products and any such new products may not gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nThe cancellation or delays in the purchase of the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in customer demand for the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nChanges in domestic and foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nThe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nChanges in the mix of products sold by the Company;\n\u2022\nCompetitive pressures on prices at which the Company can sell its products;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of new strategic relationships by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nLitigation costs and settlements; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions and other external factors such as energy costs.\nThe Company sets its spending levels in advance of each quarter based, in part, on the Company\u2019s expectations of product orders and shipments during that quarter. A shortfall in revenue, therefore, in any particular quarter as compared to the Company\u2019s plan could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Also, the Company\u2019s quarterly results could fluctuate due to general market conditions in the healthcare industry or global economy generally, or market volatility unrelated to the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nFailure of the market to accept the Company\u2019s products could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial condition will depend in part upon the market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products. The Company\u2019s products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance. Market acceptance depends on a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nThe price of the products;\n\u2022\nThe continued receipt of regulatory approvals for multiple indications;\n\u2022\nThe establishment and demonstration of the clinical safety and efficacy of the Company\u2019s products; and\n\u2022\nThe advantages of the Company\u2019s products over those marketed by the Company\u2019s competitors.\nAny failure to achieve or maintain significant market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products will have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nOn February 19, 2016 the Company received a delisting letter from Nasdaq concerning the Company's equity being approximately $2,453,000 as of December 31, 2015 which is approximately $47,000 below the NASDAQ Minimum Equity Listing Requirement. The Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq outling how it plans to regain compliance. The Company's plan was accepted by Nasdaq and the Company was given until August 17, 2016 to implement its plan and regain compliance.\nNASDAQ Delisting Notice\nOn March 2, 2016, NASDAQ notified the Escalon Medical Corp. (the \"Company\") that the bid price of its listed security had closed at less than $1 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days, and, as a result, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Rule\"). In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided 180 calendar days, or until August 29, 2016, to regain compliance with the Rule. The Company received a letter from NASDAQ dated August 30, 2016 stating that the NASDAQ staff determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. The Company had previously requested an appeal of the staff's determination of the Company's failure to comply with the minimum $2,500,000 stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing.\nTherefore, both issues will be addressed at the requested hearing with the Hearings Panel. The Company is continuing its plan for compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing standards. The Company's appeal of the NASDAQ\u2019s determination to the Panel, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series will stay the suspension of the Company\u2019s securities pending the Panel\u2019s decision.\nThe Company\u2019s products are subject to stringent ongoing regulation by the FDA and similar domestic and foreign health care regulatory authorities, and if the regulatory approvals or clearances of the Company\u2019s products are\nrestricted or revoked, the Company could face delays that would impair the Company\u2019s ability to generate funds from operations.\nThe FDA and similar health care regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively regulate the Company\u2019s activities. The Company must obtain either 510(K) clearances or pre-market approvals and new drug application approvals prior to marketing any products in the United States. Foreign regulation also requires that the Company obtain other approvals from foreign government agencies prior to the sale of products in those countries. Also, the Company may be required to obtain FDA approval before exporting a product or device that has not received FDA marketing clearance or approval.\nThe Company has received the necessary FDA approvals for all products that the Company currently markets in the United States. Any restrictions on or revocation of the FDA approvals and clearances that the Company has obtained, however, would prevent the continued marketing of the impacted products and other devices. The restrictions or revocations could result from the discovery of previously unknown problems with the product. Consequently, FDA revocation would impair the Company\u2019s ability to generate funds from operations.\nThe FDA and comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical and medical device equipment and related disposables, including the obligation to adhere to the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Compliance with these regulations requires time-consuming detailed validation of manufacturing and quality control processes, FDA periodic inspections and other procedures. If the FDA finds any deficiencies in the validation processes, for example, the FDA may impose restrictions on marketing the specific products until such deficiencies are corrected.\nThe Company has received CE approval on several of the Company\u2019s products that allows the Company to sell the products in the countries comprising the European Community. In addition to the CE mark, however, some foreign countries may require separate individual foreign regulatory clearances. The Company may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances for other products in the United States or foreign markets.\nThe process for obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals underlying clinical studies for any new products or devices and for multiple indications for existing products is lengthy and will require substantial commitments of Company\u2019s financial resources and Company\u2019s management\u2019s time and effort. Any delay in obtaining clearances or approvals or any changes in existing regulatory requirements would materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with the applicable regulations would subject the Company to fines, delays or suspensions of approvals or clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of products with which the Company\u2019s products compete could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company faces intense competition in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets, which are characterized by rapidly changing technology, short product life cycles, cyclical oversupply and rapid price erosion. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources. The Company\u2019s strategy is to compete primarily on the basis of technological innovation, reliability, quality and price of the Company\u2019s products. Without timely introductions of new products and enhancements, the Company\u2019s products will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results would suffer. The success of the Company\u2019s new product offerings will depend on several factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nProperly identify customer needs;\n\u2022\nInnovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\n\u2022\nEstablish adequate product distribution coverage;\n\u2022\nObtain and maintain required regulatory approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nProtect the Company\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u2022\nSuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nManufacture and deliver the Company\u2019s products in sufficient volumes on time;\n\u2022\nDifferentiate the Company\u2019s offerings from the offerings of the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022\nPrice the Company\u2019s products competitively;\n\u2022\nAnticipate competitors\u2019 announcements of new products, services or technological innovations; and\n\u2022\nAnticipate general market and economic conditions.\nThe Company may not be able to compete effectively in the competitive environments in which the Company operates.\nThe Company\u2019s products employ proprietary technology, and this technology may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe Company holds several United States and foreign patents for the Company\u2019s products. Other parties, however, hold patents relating to similar products and technologies. If patents held by others were adjudged valid and interpreted broadly in an adversarial proceeding, the court or agency could deem them to cover one or more aspects of the Company\u2019s products or procedures. Any claims for patent infringements or claims by the Company for patent enforcement would consume time, result in costly litigation, divert technical and management personnel or require the Company to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. The Company may become subject to one or more claims for patent infringement. The Company may not prevail in any such action, and the Company\u2019s patents may not afford protection against competitors with similar technology.\nIf a court determines that any of the Company\u2019s products infringes, directly or indirectly, on a patent in a particular market, the court may enjoin the Company from making, using or selling the product. Furthermore, the Company may be required to pay damages or obtain a royalty-bearing license, if available, on acceptable terms.\nLack of availability of key system components could result in delays, increased costs or costly redesign of the Company\u2019s products.\nAlthough some of the parts and components used to manufacture the Company\u2019s products are available from multiple sources, the Company currently purchases most of the Company\u2019s components and outsourced finished goods from single sources in an effort to obtain volume discounts. Lack of availability of any of these parts, components and finished goods could result in production delays, increased costs or costly redesign of the Company\u2019s products. Any loss of availability of an essential component or finished good could result in a material adverse change to the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of the Company\u2019s suppliers are subject to the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Failure of these suppliers to comply with those regulations could result in the delay or limitation of the supply of parts or components to the Company, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to market or sell the Company\u2019s products may be adversely impacted by limitations on reimbursements by government programs, private insurance plans and other third party payers.\nThe Company\u2019s customers bill various third party payers, including government programs and private insurance plans, for the health care services provided to their patients. Third party payers may reimburse the customer, usually at a fixed rate based on the procedure performed, or may deny reimbursement if they determine that the use of the Company\u2019s products was elective, unnecessary, inappropriate, not cost-effective, experimental or used for a non-approved indication. Third party payers may deny reimbursement notwithstanding FDA approval or clearance of a product and may challenge the prices charged for the medical products and services. The Company\u2019s ability to sell the Company\u2019s products on a profitable basis may be adversely impacted by denials of reimbursement or limitations on reimbursement, compared with reimbursement available for competitive products and procedures. New legislation that further reduces reimbursements under the capital cost pass-through system utilized in connection with the Medicare program could also adversely impact the marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company may become involved in product liability litigation, which may subject the Company to liability and divert management attention.\nThe testing and marketing of the Company\u2019s products entails an inherent risk of product liability, resulting in claims based upon injuries or alleged injuries or a failure to diagnose associated with a product defect. Some of these injuries may not become evident for a number of years. Although the Company is not currently involved in any product liability litigation, the Company may be party to litigation in the future as a result of an alleged claim. Litigation, regardless of the merits of the claim or outcome, could consume a great deal of the Company\u2019s time and attention away from the Company\u2019s core businesses. The Company maintains limited product liability insurance coverage of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, with umbrella policy coverage of $5,000,000 in excess of such amounts. A successful product liability claim in excess of any insurance coverage may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s product liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available to the Company in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws or policies of foreign governmental agencies and social and economic conditions in the countries in which the Company operates.\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenue from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of governmental agencies, as well as social and economic conditions, in the countries in which the Company operates could impact the Company\u2019s business in these countries and the Company\u2019s results of operations. Also, economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and competitive factors such as price competition, business combinations of competitors or a decline in industry sales from continued economic weakness, both in the United States and other countries in which the Company conducts business, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its management and key personnel to succeed.\nThe Company\u2019s principal executive officers and technical personnel have extensive experience with the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s research and development efforts, the development of marketing and sales programs and the necessary support services to be provided to the Company\u2019s customers. Also, the Company competes with other companies, universities, research entities and other organizations to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company\u2019s executive officers or other technical personnel, or the Company\u2019s failure to attract and retain other skilled and experienced personnel, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or expand businesses.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s stock has historically been volatile, and the Company has not paid cash dividends.\nThe volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock imposes a greater risk of capital losses on shareholders as compared to less volatile stocks. In addition, such volatility makes it difficult to ascribe a stable valuation to a shareholder\u2019s holdings of the Company\u2019s common stock. The following factors have and may continue to have a significant impact on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock:\n\u2022\nAcquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures that the Company effects, if any;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of technological innovations;\n\u2022\nChanges in marketing, product pricing and sales strategies or new products by the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u2022\nChanges in domestic or foreign governmental regulations or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nDevelopments or disputes relating to patent or proprietary rights and public concern as to the safety and efficacy of the procedures for which the Company\u2019s products are used.\nMoreover, the possibility exists that the stock market, and in particular the securities of technology companies such as the Company, could experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated to operating performance.\nThe Company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIf the Company raises funds in the future, the Company may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements at prices and other terms that may not be favorable. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe impact of terrorism or acts of war could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nTerrorist acts or acts of war, whether in the United States or abroad, could cause damage or disruption to the Company\u2019s operations, its suppliers, channels to market or customers, or could cause costs to increase, or create political or economic instability, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s charter documents and Pennsylvania law may inhibit a takeover.\nCertain provisions of Pennsylvania law and the Company\u2019s Bylaws could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. These provisions could limit the share price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with directors in each class elected for three-year terms. The Bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors may issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval on such terms and conditions, and having such rights, privileges and preferences, as the Board may determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely impacted by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The Company has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and operating results.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports the Company files with the SEC are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and inventories and related valuation allowances, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the recoverability of the Company\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets, pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued authoritative guidance. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges. Any resulting expense or impairment loss would be recorded as a charge against our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and operating results.\nOn an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among others, those relating to:\n\u2022\nsales returns;\n\u2022\nallowances for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022\ninventories and related valuation allowances;\n\u2022\nintangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022\nincome and other tax accruals;\n\u2022\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowances;\n\u2022\nsales discounts;\n\u2022\nwarranty obligations; and\n\u2022\naccrued lease termination costs\n\u2022\ncontingencies and litigation.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company\u2019s assumptions and estimates may, however, prove to have been incorrect and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates it makes are reasonable, any changes to the Company\u2019s assumptions or estimates, or any actual results which differ from the Company\u2019s assumptions or estimates, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and operating results.\nHealthcare policy changes, including pending proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system and implementation of the Affordable Healthcare Act, may have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep these costs down. Certain proposals, if passed, would impose limitations on the prices the Company will be able to charge for the Company\u2019s products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for its products from governmental agencies or third-party payers. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in the healthcare industry in the U.S. and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products as well as the way in which the Company conducts the Company\u2019s business. On March 23, 2010, health reform legislation was approved by Congress and has been signed into law. The healthcare reform act provides that most individuals must have health insurance, establishes new regulations on health plans, and creates insurance pooling mechanisms and other expanded public health care measures.\nThe Company anticipates that out of the reform legislation will come a reduction in Medicare spending on services provided by hospitals and other providers and a form of sales or excise tax on the medical device manufacturing sector. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. The Company cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on the\nCompany. However, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for the Company\u2019s products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, possibly materially.\nFuture legislation or changes in government programs may adversely impact the market for the Company\u2019s products.\nFrom time to time, the federal government and Congress have made proposals to change aspects of the delivery and financing of health care services. The Company cannot predict what form any future legislation or regulation may take or its impact on the Company\u2019s business. Legislation that sets price limits and utilization controls adversely impact the rate of growth of the markets in which the Company participates. If any future health care legislation or regulations were to adversely impact those markets, the Company\u2019s product marketing could also suffer, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 77892, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ESMC"}
