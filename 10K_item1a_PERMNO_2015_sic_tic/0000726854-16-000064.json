{"cik": "726854", "company": "CITY HOLDING CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. If any of the following risks occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic Conditions in the Company's Market Areas Could Negatively Impact the Company's Business and Financial Condition\nThe Company\u2019s business is concentrated in West Virginia, Virginia, southeastern Ohio and Kentucky. As a result, the Company\u2019s results of operation, cash flows and financial condition are affected by local and regional economic conditions. A downturn in the economies within the Company\u2019s market area, or in any one of them, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition. Some examples of economic deterioration include declines in economic growth, declines in consumer and business confidence, increases in inflation, increases in the cost of capital and credit, and limitations in the availability of credit. The Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and the ability of its customers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans to City National, is highly dependent on the strength of the economic and business environment in the market areas where the Company operates and in the United States as a whole. Additionally, the value of collateral securing loans made and held by City National is impacted by the strength of the economy. Deteriorating economic conditions in the Company\u2019s market areas could cause declines in the overall quality of the loan portfolio requiring charge-off of a greater percentage of loans and/or an increase in the allowance for loan losses, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the economic and business environment in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky have shown improvement since the recession of 2007 to 2009, there can be no assurance that such improvement will continue or that the economies in the Company\u2019s market areas, or the United States as a whole, will not slip into recession. Such a lack of continued economic improvement or slippage into recession could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe oil, natural gas and coal industries, and businesses ancillary thereto, play an important role in the economies of West Virginia, Virginia, southeastern Ohio and Kentucky. The significant and rapid decline in oil and gas prices over the past year have negatively impacted oil and gas and other businesses in the Company\u2019s market areas. Additionally, the coal industry continues to be in decline as a result of increased environmental and safety regulatory burden and a decline in demand for coal. Prolonged low oil and gas prices, and continued decline in the coal industry, could result in downward pressure on businesses in the Company\u2019s market area which could negatively affect City National\u2019s customers (both individuals and businesses). As a result the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nThe Value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock Fluctuates\nThe market for the Company\u2019s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results, changes in expectations of future financial performance, changes in estimates by securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, banking industry reform measures, customer relationship developments and other factors, many of which will be beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for financial institutions in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nThe Trading Volume In The Company\u2019s Common Stock Is Less Than That Of Other Larger Financial Services Companies\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Company\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to fall.\nFuture Sales of Shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock Could Negatively Affect its Market Price\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock in the open market. We make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nShares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock Are Not FDIC Insured\nNeither the FDIC nor any other governmental agency insures the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Therefore, the value of your shares in the Company will be based on their market value and may decline.\nThe Company\u2019s Ability To Pay Dividends Is Limited\nAlthough the Board of Directors has declared cash dividends in the past, the current ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from City National. Federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of City National to pay dividends. Holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to dividends if, and when, they are declared by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Additional restrictions are placed upon the Company by the policies of federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s November 14, 1985 policy statement, which provides that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of the past year\u2019s net income, and then only if their prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with their capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In general, future dividend policy is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s and City National\u2019s future earnings, capital requirements, regulatory constraints and financial condition.\nAn Economic Slowdown in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio Could Hurt the Company's Business\nBecause the Company focuses its business in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio, an economic slowdown in these states, or any one of them could hurt the Company's business. Many of our markets rely heavily on the coal industry and negative impacts to the coal industry can have broader economic impacts. An economic slowdown could have the following consequences:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nDemand for the products and services of City National may decline; and\n\u2022\nCollateral (including real estate) for loans made by City National may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and making existing loans less secure.\nOur exposure to coal industry specific loans as of December 31, 2015 is less than $10 million.\nThe Value of Real Estate Collateral May Fluctuate Significantly Resulting in an Under-Collateralized Loan Portfolio.\nThe market value of real estate, particularly real estate held for investment, can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. If the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the Company's loan portfolio were to decline materially, a significant part of the Company's loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then, in the event of foreclosure, we may not be able to realize the amount of collateral that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's provision for loan losses and the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company and City National are Extensively Regulated\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters including but not limited to (i) ownership and control of the Company's shares, (ii) acquisition of other companies and businesses, (iii) permissible activities to engage in, (iv) maintenance of adequate capital levels\nand (v) other operational aspects. The bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the bank and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of, and government intervention in, the financial services sector. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to reduced revenues, additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProposals to change the laws and regulations governing financial institutions are frequently raised in Congress and before bank regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially affect the Company\u2019s business, and the likelihood of any major changes in the future and their effects are impossible to determine. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the ultimate form any proposed legislation might take or how it might affect the Company.\nThe Company Is Subject To Lending Risk\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company\u2019s lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Company operates. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company.\nThe Company is Subject to Interest Rate Risk\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings also could be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned \u201cRisk Management\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s management of interest rate risk.\nThe Company May Be Adversely Affected By The Soundness Of Other Financial Institutions\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be\nrealized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Allowance for Loan Losses May Not Be Sufficient\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses in the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to provide for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly, which includes testing certain individual loans as well as collective pools of loans for impairment. This evaluation includes an assessment of actual loss experience within each category of the portfolio, individual commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit credit weakness; current economic events, including employment statistics, trends in bankruptcy filings, and other pertinent factors; industry or geographic concentrations, and regulatory guidance. See the section captioned \u201cAllowance and Provision for Loan Losses\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nCustomers May Default On the Repayment of Loans\nCity National\u2019s customers may default on the repayment of loans, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings due to loss of principal and interest income. Increased operating expenses may result from the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. Collection efforts may or may not be successful causing the Company to write off the loan or repossess the collateral securing the loan, which may or may not exceed the balance of the loan.\nDue To Increased Competition, the Company May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Banking Customers At Current Levels\nThe Company faces competition from the following:\n\u2022\nlocal, regional and national banks;\n\u2022\nsavings and loans;\n\u2022\nInternet banks;\n\u2022\ncredit unions;\n\u2022\nfinance companies; and\n\u2022\nbrokerage firms serving the Company\u2019s market areas.\nIn particular, City National\u2019s competitors include several major national financial and banking companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions may have products and services not offered by the Company, which may cause current and potential customers to choose those institutions. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits and range and quality of services provided. If the Company is unable to attract new and retain current customers, loan and deposit growth could decrease causing the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition to be negatively impacted.\nThe Company May Be Required To Write Down Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets, Causing Its Financial Condition And Results To Be Negatively Affected\nWhen the Company acquires a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31,\n2015, the Company\u2019s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $80 million. Under current accounting standards, if the Company determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, it would be required to write down the value of these assets. The Company conducts an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired. The Company recently completed such an impairment analysis and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company cannot provide assurance whether it will be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on its shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and may cause a decline in the Company's stock price.\nAcquisition Opportunities May Present Challenges\nAny future acquisitions may result in unforeseen difficulties, which could require significant time and attention from the Company's management that would otherwise be directed at developing its existing business. In addition, the Company could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions for which it may become responsible. Further, the benefits that the Company anticipates from these acquisitions may not develop.\nSystem Failure or Cybersecurity Breaches of the Company's Network Security Could Subject the Company to Increased Operating Costs, as Well as Litigation and Other Potential Losses.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure that the Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft.\u201d The Company's operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in the Company's operations could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company's operations are dependent upon its ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by the Company, including our Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the Company's computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to the Company, damage its reputation and inhibit current and potential customers from its using Internet banking services.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor will we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other Internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nA successful attack to our system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidences in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company's Risk Management Practices May Prove to be Inadequate or Not Fully Effective\nThe Company's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. The Company has established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk which it is subject to, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Although the Company has devoted significant resources to develop its risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as its risk management techniques, may not be fully effective. In addition, as regulations and markets in which the Company operates continue to evolve, its risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If the Company's risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate its risks, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. Management of the Company's risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models the Company uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate, it may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that the Company has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated.\nThe Company\u2019s Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented\nAny failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.\nSignificant Legal Actions Could Result in Substantial Liabilities\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to claims related to its operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by its regulators, could involve large monetary claims and cause the Company to incur significant defense claims. As a result, the Company may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could negatively affect its shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results.\nThe Company Relies Heavily on Its Management Team, and the Unexpected Loss of Key Management May Adversely Affect Its Operations\nThe Company's success to date has been strongly influenced by its ability to attract and to retain senior management experienced in banking in the markets it serves. The Company's ability to retain executive officers and the current management teams will continue to be important to the successful implementation of its strategies. The Company has employment agreements with these key employees in the event of a change of control, as well as confidential information, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements related to its stock options. No other employment agreements exist with key employees. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial results.", "PERMNO": 11442, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CHCO"}
