{"cik": "842518", "company": "EVANS BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following factors identified by the Company's management represent significant potential risks that the Company faces in its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Business May Be Adversely Affected by Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in Western New York and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, declines in housing and real estate valuations, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nEconomic conditions in the United States continued to improve in 2015, which included national and local unemployment rates dropping from 5.6% and 5.8%, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 to 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. Although conditions in Western New York and the United States have improved, a slowdown of the economic conditions in other parts of the world, particularly Europe and China, may begin to affect the United States economically. Such conditions could materially adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans, and therefore, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCommercial Real Estate and Commercial Business Loans Expose the Company to Increased Credit Risks\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company's portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $461 million, or 60% of total loans outstanding, and the Company's portfolio of commercial and industrial (\u201cC&I\u201d) loans totaled $144 million, or 19% of total loans outstanding. The Company plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans as they generally earn a higher rate of interest than other loan products offered by the Bank. Commercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of commercial real estate and C&I loans often depends on the successful operations and the income stream of the borrowers. Commercial mortgages are collateralized by real property while C&I loans are typically secured by business assets such as equipment and accounts receivable. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of the Company's commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or C&I loan outstanding with the Company. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to four-family residential mortgage loan. Commercial real estate loans in non-accrual status at December 31, 2015 were $7.8 million, compared with $3.2 million at December 31, 2014. C&I loans in non-accrual status at December 31, 2015 were $5.3 million, compared with $5.5 million at December 31, 2014. Increases in the delinquency levels of commercial real estate and C&I loans could result in an increase in non-performing loans and the provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuing Concentration of Loans in the Company's Primary Market Area May Increase the Company's Risk\nUnlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers located primarily in western New York State (\u201cWNY\u201d). Therefore, the Company's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in WNY. The Company's business lending and marketing strategies focus on loans to small and medium-sized businesses in this geographic region. Moreover, the Company's assets are heavily concentrated in mortgages on properties located in WNY. Accordingly, the Company's business and operations are vulnerable to downturns in the economy of WNY. The concentration of the Company's loans in this geographic region subjects the Company to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in this region could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, which would more greatly affect the Company than if the Company's lending were more geographically diversified. In addition, the Company may suffer losses if there is a decline in the value of properties underlying the Company's mortgage loans which would have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations.\nIn the Event the Company's Allowance for Loan Losses is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, the Company's Earnings Could Decrease\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses in order to capture the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. There is a risk that the Company may experience significant loan losses which could exceed the allowance for loan losses. In determining the amount of the Company's recorded allowance, the Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers, the effect of changes in the local economy on the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans, the effects on the Company's loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, and the Company's loan quality reviews. The emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and C&I loans is a significant factor in evaluating an allowance for loan losses. As the Company continues to increase the amount of these loans in the portfolio, additional or increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary and would adversely affect the results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review the Company's loan portfolio and credit underwriting procedures, as well as its allowance for loan losses, and may require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a gross loan portfolio of approximately $774 million and the allowance for loan losses was approximately $12.9 million, which represented 1.66% of the total amount of gross loans. If the Company's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect or bank regulators require the Company to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, the Company may have to increase its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurances that the Company's allowance for loan losses will be adequate to protect the Company against loan losses that it may incur.\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect the Company's Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe Company's results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Company's results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities. Because the Company's interest-bearing liabilities generally re-price or mature more quickly than its interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in its net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of the Company's interest-earning assets, and in particular, the Company's securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2015, the Company's securities available for sale totaled $96 million. Net unrealized gains on securities available for sale, net of tax, amounted to $0.8 million and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale, therefore, could have an adverse effect on stockholders' equity or earnings.\nThe Company also is subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, the Company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nConsistent with its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (the \u201cFed\u201d) had practiced policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities throughout 2012 and 2013. During 2014, the Fed discontinued its purchase of agency mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) based on improvement in the labor market. The target overnight rate had been between 0.00% and 0.25% since the end of 2008 until the Fed raised its target rate to between 0.25% and 0.50% in December 2015. The impact of this Fed decision to raise its targeted overnight rate late in 2015 had minimal impact on the Company\u2019s 2015 results.\nEasy monetary policy by the Fed may increase the interest rate risk for the Company by lowering interest rates over the near term, but also by inadvertently causing inflation to rise at a rapid pace once the economy more fully rebounds from the recession. High inflation rates are usually accompanied by an increase in interest rates.\nThe Fed\u2019s accommodative stance has resulted in extraordinarily low interest rates during the past five years and played a part in compressing the Company\u2019s net interest margin. Further margin compression could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company May Be Adversely Affected by the Soundness of Other Financial Institutions\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of counterparty relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and impact our business. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be relied upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe most important counterparty for the Company, in terms of liquidity, is the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (\u201cFHLBNY\u201d). The Company uses FHLBNY as its primary source of borrowed overnight funds and also has several long-term advances with FHLBNY. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of $10 million in borrowed funds with FHLBNY. The Company has placed sufficient collateral in the form of commercial and residential real estate loans at FHLBNY. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Bank is required to hold stock in FHLBNY. The Bank held FHLBNY stock with a fair value of $1.3 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThere are 12 branches of the FHLB, including New York. If a member were at risk of breaching risk-based capital requirements, it could suspend dividends, cut dividend payments, and/or not buy back excess FHLB stock that members hold. FHLBNY has stated that they expect to be able to continue to pay dividends, redeem excess capital stock, and provide competitively priced advances in the future. Nonetheless, the 12 FHLB branches are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB branch cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system\u2019s debt; other FHLB branches can be called upon to make the payment.\nSystemic weakness in the FHLB could result in higher costs of FHLB borrowings, reduced value of FHLB stock, and increased demand for alternative sources of liquidity that are more expensive, such as brokered time deposits, the discount window at the Federal Reserve, or lines of credit with correspondent banks First Tennessee Bank and M&T Bank.\nStrong Competition Within the Company's Market Area May Limit the Company\u2019s Growth and Profitability\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. The Company competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally within the Company's market area and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company does, and may offer certain services that the Company does not or cannot provide. The Company's profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in this market area.\nExpansion of the Company\u2019s Branch Network May Adversely Affect its Financial Results\nThe Company cannot assure that the opening of new branches will be accretive to earnings or that it will be accretive to earnings within a reasonable period of time. Numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new branch, such as suitable location, qualified personnel, and an effective marketing strategy. Additionally, it takes time for a new branch to gather sufficient loans and deposits to generate income sufficient to cover its operating expenses. Difficulties the Company experiences in opening new branches may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company Operates in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected By Changes in Laws and Regulations\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, FRB, and by the FDIC, as insurer of its deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may\nengage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors. Regulatory requirements affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the imposition of deposit insurance premiums and other assessments, the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a bank's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, particularly through the new rules and regulations expected to be established by the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank, the Company and its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLack of System Integrity or Credit Quality Related to Funds Settlement could Result in a Financial Loss\nThe Bank settles funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receives funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by the Bank include debit card, credit card and electronic bill payment transactions, supporting consumers, financial institutions and other businesses. These payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties and the facilitation of the payment. If the continuity of operations or integrity of processing were compromised this could result in a financial loss to the Bank, and therefore the Company, due to a failure in payment facilitation. In addition, the Bank may issue credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement. A default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to the Bank, and therefore to the Company.\nThe Bank\u2019s Planned Core Bank Processing System Conversion Exposes the Company to Operating and Financial Risks\nThe Company expects the Bank to complete a transition to a new core processing system during 2016. If the Bank is not able to complete the transition as planned, or unanticipated events occur during the transition, the Company\u2019s operations, net income, and reputation could be adversely affected. The Bank\u2019s core processing system is used to maintain customer and account records, reflect account transactions and activity, and support the Bank\u2019s customer relationship management systems for substantially all of the Bank\u2019s deposit and loan customers. Core systems conversions involve extensive planning and operational changes that affect bank account records, customer service delivery, internal procedures, technology risk management, and other significant operating activities. The conversion to a new vendor involves conversion costs and creates the risk of contract and performance disputes, the possible disruption of service to customers, and the uncertainty of dealing with new systems and new vendors. The Bank has worked closely with third parties to manage the related operating and financial risks. Potential problems with new systems could involve regulatory compliance risk, potentially resulting in higher operating costs or limitations on operating activities. If the Bank is not able to complete the transition to the new core processing system as expected in accordance with the work plan, or if unanticipated events occur during or following the transition, the Bank may not be able to timely process transactions for its customers, those customers may not be able to complete transactions in or affecting their accounts that are maintained on the core processing system, or the Bank may not be able to perform contractual and other obligations to its customers or other parties, such as payment networks in which the Bank participates. If any of these consequences occur, the Bank may incur additional expense in its financial and regulatory reporting and in processing or re-processing transactions. In addition, the Bank may not be able to meet customer expectations for transaction processing and customer service, customers may lose confidence in the Bank and close their accounts with the Bank, and the Bank may incur liability under contractual or other arrangements with customers or other parties. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of the Bank\u2019s core processing system could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations, net income, reputation or the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and could expose the Company and the Bank to civil liability or regulatory sanctions.\nFinancial Services Companies Depend on the Accuracy and Completeness of Information about Customers and Counterparties\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. The Company may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. While management generally engages only third parties that it knows or believes to be reputable, reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause the Company to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of Key Employees May Disrupt Relationships with Certain Customers\nThe Company\u2019s business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of the Company\u2019s key employees have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While management believes that the Company\u2019s relationships with its key business producers are good, the Company cannot guarantee that all of its key personnel will remain with the organization. Loss of such key personnel, particularly if they enter into an employment relationship with one of the Company\u2019s competitors, could result in the loss of some of the Company\u2019s customers. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture FDIC Insurance Premium Increases May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Earnings\nThe Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or other similar occurrences, the FDIC may again increase the premiums assessed upon insured institutions. Such increases and any future increases or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is a Financial Holding Company and Depends on Its Subsidiaries for Dividends, Distributions and Other Payments\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to the Company\u2019s stockholders and principal and interest on its outstanding debt, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank, as well as the payment of dividends by the Company to its stockholders. Regulations of the OCC affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions and to make loans to the Company. If the Bank is unable to make dividend payments and sufficient capital is not otherwise available, the Company may not be able to make dividend payments to its common stockholders or principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt.\nBecause the Nature of the Financial Services Business Involves a High Volume of Transactions, the Company Faces Significant Operational Risks\nThe Company operates in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s Information Systems may Experience an Interruption or Breach in Security\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s\ncustomer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. If personal, nonpublic, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in the Company\u2019s possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the Company\u2019s systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Potential for Business Interruption Exists Throughout the Company\u2019s Organization\nIntegral to the Company\u2019s performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in the Company\u2019s day-to-day and ongoing operations. Failure by any or all of these resources subjects the Company to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope. This includes, but is not limited to, operational or technical failures, pandemics, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected, as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly. Although management has established policies and procedures to address such failures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental Factors May Create Liability\nIn the course of its business, the Bank has acquired and may acquire in the future, property securing loans that are in default. There is a risk that the Bank could be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties after acquisition by the Bank in a foreclosure action, and that the Bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with such contamination. In addition, the owner or former owners of contaminated sites may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such property. To date, the Bank has not been required to perform any investigation or clean-up activities, nor has it been subject to any environmental claims. There can be no assurance, however, that this will remain the case in the future.\nAnti-takeover Laws and Certain Agreements and Charter Provisions May Adversely Affect Share Value\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company without approval of the Company\u2019s board of directors. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the FRB before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company, including shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquiror \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including the Bank. There also are provisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquiror and thus could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nDamage to our Reputation Could Adversely Impact our Business\nOur business reputation is important to our success. Our ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors may depend upon external perceptions of our Company. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the misconduct of employees,\nadvisors and counterparties. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees and advisors. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations. If any of these developments has a material effect on our reputation, our business could suffer.", "PERMNO": 89038, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EVBN"}
