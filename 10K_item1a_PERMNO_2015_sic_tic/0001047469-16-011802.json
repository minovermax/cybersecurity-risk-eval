{"cik": "1354513", "company": "CTC Media, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe and our operating businesses face numerous risks. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nCTC Media holds only a 25% interest in the operating businesses of the CTC group, and therefore has no control and limited influence over these businesses.\nPrior to the UTH sale in December 2015, we owned 100% of CTC Investments, which directly and indirectly owns all of the operations of the CTC group. Following the UTH sale, we retain only a 25% interest in CTC Investments, which could be diluted to 20% pursuant to the further issuance of interests in CTC Investments to UTH that we have authorized. Given our minority position in this company, we have no ability to control its operations and limited influence over its decisions. In addition, we have no right to cause CTC Investments to pay dividends or other distributions to our company. As a consequence, we have only the limited rights afforded to a minority shareholder under Russian company law, which may provide limited protections.\nFollowing the UTH sale, CTC Media holds a significant amount of cash pending completion of the proposed merger transaction.\nWe hold a significant amount of cash following the UTH sale in December 2015. The proceeds of the sale received as at December 31, 2015 were $150.5 million, with an additional $42.5 million received on February 12, 2016. We will continue to hold this cash, together with available cash on hand, pending completion of the proposed merger transaction. Although we expect the merger to complete in the second quarter of 2016, we cannot predict with certainty when this will take place.\nThere are risks surrounding our continued holding of a significant amount of cash, including fluctuations in the world economy, changes to the stability or liquidity of international banking markets and the effect of international sanctions. See \"-The current geopolitical situation over Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and will require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts.\" Although these risks have not to date affected our cash holdings, these or other developments that affect international banking markets could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nThe per share consideration in the proposed merger will be based upon the amount of our cash available as of the merger, which is dependent upon the timing of the merger and the cash requirements of our company at that time.\nAs previously announced, based on the final purchase price received in the UTH sale, we currently anticipate that the per share merger consideration will be at the lower end of the top half of the range approved by stockholders, which was $1.77 to $2.19. The actual amount of such consideration will depend on the timing of the merger and the anticipated cash reserves that will be appropriate in light of potential liabilities at the time of closing. In addition, we have received confirmation from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that we are due a tax refund in respect of the 2011 tax year, which will form part of the consideration available to stockholders in the merger. We expect to receive such refund imminently, but have no control over the timing of such receipt, and therefore are unable to predict with certainty the timing of the merger.\nEven if the merger is not consummated, our common stock may cease to be traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and we may decide to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act, which could result in risks for our stockholders.\nUpon consummation of the merger, it is our intention to delist and deregister our common stock. As previously announced, Nasdaq notified us on January 13, 2016 that it had determined to initiate procedures to delist our securities as a result of our failure to hold a 2015 annual meeting of stockholders by December 31, 2015. As a result of such failure, we do not comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) with respect to the annual meeting requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. We have appealed this determination and Nasdaq has agreed to continue our listing until at least April 15, 2016 to allow us time to complete the proposed merger transaction. If the merger is not completed by that date we intend to seek a further extension of our listing but there can be no assurance that any such extension would be granted.\nIn the event that our common stock is voluntarily or involuntarily delisted prior to consummation of the merger, we may also elect to deregister our common stock under the Exchange Act, assuming we meet the other requirements for deregistration. As a result, our stockholders would be subject to the risks of an investment in a private rather than a public company, because the duty to file periodic reports (including annual, quarterly and current reports) with the SEC would be suspended. As such, public information regarding our company may not be readily available.\nOur stockholders also could be adversely affected by the minimal \"public float,\" that is, the number of shares owned by outside shareholders and available for trading, following any delisting. The suspension of our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act may reduce or eliminate any trading market for our shares and may result in further declines in the price of our shares and reduced liquidity in any trading market for our shares.\nGeopolitical and macroeconomic events have adversely affected and created uncertainty and instability in the Russian economy and have adversely affected television advertising.\nIn 2014 and 2015, Russia experienced economic instability characterized by substantial depreciation of its currency, sharp fluctuations of interest rates, a decline in the gross domestic product in 2015 and a steep decline in the value of shares traded on its stock exchanges. Additionally, because Russia produces and exports large amounts of oil, its economy is particularly vulnerable to the price of oil on the world market and recent substantial decreases in international oil prices have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect its economy.\nThe CTC group derives almost all of its revenues from the sale of advertising, which is sensitive to broader economic conditions. The group's revenues may substantially decrease if the economic environment deteriorates in Russia or other CIS countries in which it operates, which would materially adversely affect the operating results of the CTC group.\nDecreases in the value of the Russian ruble as compared to the US dollar have negatively impacted our reported revenues and operating results. If the exchange rate between the ruble and the US dollar remains at its current level, or if the ruble depreciates further, our financial results as reported in US dollars may continue to be negatively affected.\nAlthough our reporting currency is the US dollar, CTC Investments generates almost all of its revenues through the sale of advertising, which in Russia is sold primarily in rubles. The ruble is also the functional currency of CTC Investments and its principal operating subsidiaries. As a result, our reported revenues and results of discontinued operations are impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Russian ruble.\nThe current geopolitical situation over Ukraine and related international economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and will require us to employ significant time and resources to ongoing compliance efforts.\nSignificant uncertainty exists surrounding the current geopolitical situation over Ukraine. Both the United States and the European Union, as well as other countries, have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian government officials, other individuals and certain Russian companies in connection with recent developments in Ukraine and Crimea, as well as \"sectoral\" sanctions affecting specified types of transactions with named participants in certain industries, including named Russian financial institutions, and sanctions that prohibit most commercial activities by U.S. and E.U. persons in Crimea. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent or timing of any potential further economic or trade sanctions, or the ultimate outcome of the Ukrainian crisis.\nNeither we, nor CTC Investments or any of its Russian subsidiaries or other operations or assets, are a target of current sanctions and we do not appear on the United States, European Union or other lists of sanctioned parties. The shares of our common stock held by Telcrest, however, are blocked property for U.S. sanctions purposes until such time as OFAC authorizes their unblocking. The blocked status of these shares created significant complexity in structuring the UTH sale and subsequent merger transaction, and continues to create operational complexity for our company.\nApplicable sanctions may also adversely affect our relationships with international banks, advisors and commercial counterparties. We have to date encountered several international banks that have declined to transact business with us, including processing routine payments from us to third parties, as a result of internal compliance policies that are significantly more restrictive than what is required by applicable law. Although these actions have not to date materially adversely affected our operations, if international banks or other international counterparties decline to do business with us because of real or perceived compliance concerns, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial position.\nA reduction in the CTC group's audience shares and ratings would likely result in a reduction in its advertising revenues.\nThe level of advertising revenues that the CTC group receives is directly tied to its audience shares and ratings. If audience shares or ratings were to fall as a result, for example, of competitive pressures, underperformance of key programs, failure to renew licenses, or a change in the method of measuring television audiences, this would likely result in a decrease in advertising revenues, which could be material.\nAny US or other foreign judgments that may be obtained against us may be difficult to enforce against us in Russia.\nAlthough CTC Media is a Delaware corporation, subject to suit in US federal and other courts, our equity investee company CTC Investments is located in Russia, and all of our directors and their assets are located outside the United States. Although arbitration awards are generally enforceable in Russia, judgments obtained in the United States or in other foreign courts, including those with respect to US federal securities law claims, may not be enforceable in Russia. There is no mutual recognition treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation, and no Russian federal law provides for the recognition and enforcement of foreign court judgments. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce any US or other foreign court judgment obtained against our company, CTC Investments or any of our directors in Russia.", "PERMNO": 91350, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CTCM"}
