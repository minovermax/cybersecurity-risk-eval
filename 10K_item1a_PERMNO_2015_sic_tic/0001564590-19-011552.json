{"cik": "1606180", "company": "AAC Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur actual operating results may differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, those described below. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenue, profitability and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to operate certain key treatment facilities, our corporate office or our laboratory facilities.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from four treatment facilities located in California, Florida, Nevada and Texas. It is likely that a small number of facilities will continue to contribute a significant portion of our total revenue in any given year for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we have a centralized corporate office that houses our accounting, billing and collections, information technology, and admissions center departments, centralized marketing offices and a high complexity laboratory that conducts quantitative drug testing and other laboratory services. If any event occurs that results in a complete or partial shutdown of any of these facilities, our centralized corporate office, our centralized marketing offices or laboratory, including, without limitation, any material changes in legislative, regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes or floods or prolonged airline disruptions due to a natural disaster or for any reason, such event could lead to decreased revenue and/or higher operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nWe rely on our multi-faceted sales and marketing program to continuously attract and enroll clients in our network of facilities. Our sales and marketing program includes the use of digital media, including our recovery resource websites that provide information about addiction treatment and connect website visitors with our helpline. Any disruption in our national sales and marketing program, including our digital marketing resources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe our national sales and marketing program provides us with a competitive advantage compared to treatment facilities that primarily target local geographic areas, use fewer marketing channels to attract clients and have fewer treatment options than we can provide. If any disruption occurs in our national sales and marketing program for any reason, or if we are unable to effectively attract and enroll new clients to our network of facilities, our ability to maintain census could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternet search engines play an increasingly important role in addiction treatment marketing. Google and other search engines use complex algorithms to rank websites. The algorithms take into account many factors, including the domain name itself, website content and user-friendly factors such as the speed at which the website pages may be clicked through and viewed. We cannot predict or control changes in algorithms and website rankings, which may result in lower ranking search results for our websites. Additionally, Google and other online platforms have instituted review processes required to advertise on their websites. Some of these processes are time-consuming, complex and continuously evolving. We cannot predict how these private processes, rules and restrictions will evolve or be applied to individual advertising applicants. Unexpected changes in these areas may result in a decrease in calls to our admissions center, a decrease in interactions with potential clients and a lowering of our census, which could have and material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our ability to grow or even to maintain our existing level of business depends significantly on our ability to establish and maintain close working and referral relationships with hospitals, other treatment facilities and clinicians, employers, alumni, employee assistance programs and other referral sources. We have no binding commitments with any of these referral sources. We may not be able to maintain our existing referral relationships or develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Negative changes to our existing referral relationships may cause the number of people to whom we provide care to decrease, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by third-party payors are reduced, if we are unable to maintain favorable contract terms with payors or comply with our payor contract obligations, or if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to clients, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. This risk is heightened because we are generally an \u201cout-of-network\u201d provider.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors pay for the services that we provide to many of our clients. For 2018, approximately 90% of our revenue was reimbursable by third-party payors, including amounts paid by such payors to clients, with the remaining portion payable directly by our clients. If any of these third-party payors reduce their reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to limits on the amounts payors will pay for the services we provide to their members, controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and the length of stay for clients, including preadmission authorizations and utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a client by third-party payors. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill clients. We believe that generally, health insurance companies have become more stringent and aggressive with respect to addiction treatment providers; taking measures that have put pressure on reimbursement rates, length of stay and timing of reimbursement. We expect that payor efforts to impose more stringent cost controls will continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and changes could have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the rates paid or the scope of substance use treatment services covered by third-party commercial payors are reduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThird-party payors often use plan structures, such as narrow networks or tiered networks, to encourage or require clients to use in-network providers. In-network providers typically provide services through third-party payors for a negotiated lower rate or other less favorable terms. Third-party payors generally attempt to limit use of out-of-network providers by requiring clients to pay higher copayment and/or deductible amounts for out-of-network care. Additionally, third-party payors have become increasingly aggressive in attempting to minimize the use of out-of-network providers by disregarding the assignment of payment from clients to out-of-network providers (i.e., sending payments directly to clients instead of to out-of-network providers), capping out-of-network benefits payable to clients, waiving out-of-pocket payment amounts and initiating litigation against out-of-network providers for interference with contractual relationships, insurance fraud and violation of state licensing and consumer protection laws. The majority of third-party payors consider certain of our facilities to be \u201cout-of-network\u201d providers. If third-party payors continue to impose and to increase restrictions on out-of-network providers, our revenue could be threatened, forcing our facilities to participate with third-party payors and accept lower reimbursement rates compared to our historic reimbursement rates.\nThird-party payors also are entering into sole source contracts with some healthcare providers, which could effectively limit our pool of potential clients. Moreover, third-party payors are beginning to carve out specific services, including substance abuse treatment and behavioral health services, and establish small, specialized networks of providers for such services at fixed reimbursement rates. Continued growth in the use of carve-out arrangements could materially adversely affect our business to the extent we are not selected to participate in such smaller specialized networks or if the reimbursement rate is not adequate to cover the cost of providing the service.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs are reduced or if government payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to clients, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors, both government and commercial, pay for the services that we provide to many of our clients. Following the acquisition of AdCare, a portion of our revenues come from government healthcare\nprograms, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in government healthcare programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase, and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes include reductions in reimbursement levels and to new or modified demonstration projects authorized pursuant to Medicaid waivers. Some of these changes have decreased, or could decrease, the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs. In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.\nIn addition to limits on the amount payors will pay for the services we provide to their members, government and commercial payors attempt to control costs by imposing controls designed to reduce admissions and the length of stay for clients, including preadmission authorizations and utilization review. The ability of governmental payors to control healthcare costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of insurance and managed care companies and vertical integration of health insurers with healthcare providers. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and changes could have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the rates paid or the scope of substance use treatment services covered by government payors are reduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we overestimate the reimbursement amounts that payors will pay us for out-of-network services performed, it would increase our revenue adjustments, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flows and lead to significant shifts in our results of operations from quarter to quarter that may make it difficult to project long-term performance.\nFor out-of-network services, we recognize revenue from payors at the time services are provided based on our estimate of the amount that payors will pay us for the services performed. We estimate the net realizable value of revenue by adjusting gross client charges using our expected realization and applying this discount to gross client charges. A significant or sustained decrease in our collection rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve historical collection rates in future reporting periods.\nEstimates of net realizable value are subject to significant judgment and approximation by management. It is possible that actual results could differ from the historical estimates management has used to help determine the net realizable value of revenue. If our actual collections either exceed or are less than the net realizable value estimates, we will record a revenue adjustment, either positive or negative, for the difference between our estimate of the receivable and the amount actually collected in the reporting period in which the collection occurred. A significant negative revenue adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flows in the reporting period in which such adjustment is recorded. In addition, if we record a significant revenue adjustment, either positive or negative, in any given reporting period, it may lead to significant changes in our results from operations from quarter to quarter, which may limit our ability to make accurate long-term predictions about our future performance.\nCertain third-party payors account for a significant portion of our revenue, and the reduction of reimbursement rates or coverage of services by any such payor could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nCertain payors may account for a significant portion of our revenue on an annual basis. These more significant payors can also change from year to year. If any of these or other third-party payors reduce their reimbursement rates for the services we provide or otherwise implement measures, such as specialized networks, that reduce the payments we receive, our revenue, profitability and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nA deterioration in the collectability of the accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCollection of receivables from third-party payors and clients is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks are (i) the risk of overestimating our net revenue at the time of billing, which may result in us receiving less than the recorded receivable, (ii) the risk of non-payment as a result of commercial insurance companies denying claims, (iii) in certain states, the risk that clients will fail to remit insurance payments to us when the commercial insurance company pays out-of-network claims directly to the client and (iv) resource and capacity constraints that may prevent us from handling the volume of billing and collection issues in a timely manner. Additionally, our ability to hire and retain experienced personnel affects our ability to bill and collect accounts in a timely manner. We routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the client accounts and adjust our allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business operations, payor mix or economic conditions, including changes resulting from legislation or other health reform efforts (including to repeal or significantly change the Affordable Care Act), could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, increased client concentration in states that permit commercial insurance companies to pay out-of-network claims directly to the client instead of the provider, such as California and Nevada, could adversely affect our collection of receivables. Unexpected changes in reimbursement rates by third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our information systems. Failure to effectively integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, admitting clients to our facilities, monitoring census and utilization, processing and collecting claims, reporting financial results, measuring outcomes and quality of care, managing regulatory compliance controls and maintaining operational efficiencies. These systems include software developed in-house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers. To the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems, our operations could be negatively affected. Our facilities also depend upon our information systems for electronic medical records, accounting, billing, collections, risk management, payroll and other information. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected.\nOur information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs. We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems\u2019 capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain or expand our systems properly or in a timely manner, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, working capital disruptions and increases in administrative expenses.\nIn addition, we could be subject to cybersecurity risks such as a cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology security systems and other security incidents that result in security breaches, including the theft, loss, destruction or misappropriation of individually identifiable health information subject to HIPAA and other privacy and security laws, proprietary business information or other confidential or personal data. Such an incident could disrupt our information technology systems, impede clinical operations, cause us to incur significant investigation and remediation expenses, and subject us to litigation, government inquiries, penalties and reputational damages. Information security and the continued development, maintenance and enhancement of our safeguards to protect our systems, data, software and networks are a priority for us. As security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify and enhance our safeguards and investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Cyber-attacks may also impede our ability to exercise sufficient disclosure controls. If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFurther, our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and similar events. A failure to implement our disaster recovery plans or ultimately restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the confidential health information that we store and transmit, loss, theft or destruction of electronically-stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, liability to clients and other losses.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to a variety of operational, integration and financial risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn element of our business strategy is to grow by acquiring other companies and assets in the mental health and substance abuse treatment industry. We evaluate potential acquisition opportunities consistent with the normal course of our business. Our ability to complete acquisitions is subject to a number of risks and variables, including our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable terms with the counterparties, our ability to finance the purchase price and our ability to obtain any licenses or other approvals required to operate the assets to be acquired. We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, which may impede our growth and negatively affect our results of operations, and may also require a significant amount of management\nresources. In addition, rapid growth through acquisitions exposes us to a variety of operational and financial risks. We summarize the most significant of these risks below.\nIntegration risks. We must integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations. This process involves various components of our business and the businesses we have acquired, including the following:\n\u2022\nphysicians and employees who are not familiar with our operations;\n\u2022\nclients who may elect to switch to another substance abuse treatment provider;\n\u2022\nassignment or termination of material contracts, including commercial payor agreements;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance programs and state and federal licensing requirements; and\n\u2022\ndisparate operating, information and record keeping systems and technology platforms.\nThe integration of acquisitions with our operations could be expensive, require significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects and may impose challenges on the combined business including, without limitation, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies, business cultures, internal controls and compliance. In addition, certain acquisitions require a capital outlay, and the return we achieve on such invested capital may be less than the return that we could achieve on other projects or investments.\nExpected benefits may not materialize. When evaluating potential acquisition targets, we identify potential synergies and cost savings that we expect to realize upon the successful completion of the acquisition and the integration of the related operations. We may, however, be unable to achieve or may otherwise never realize the expected benefits. Our ability to realize the expected benefits from potential cost savings and revenue improvement opportunities is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Such uncertainties may include changes to regulations impacting the substance abuse treatment and behavioral healthcare industries, reductions in reimbursement rates from third-party payors, operating difficulties, difficulties obtaining required licenses and permits, client preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions. If we do not achieve our expected results, it may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAssumptions of unknown liabilities. Businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, without limitation, liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. Although we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of such facilities for at least a portion of these matters, we may experience difficulty enforcing those indemnification obligations, or we may incur material liabilities in excess of any indemnification for the past activities of acquired facilities. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility\u2019s reputation could negatively impact our business.\nCompleting acquisitions. Suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms. Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for an acquired facility, the acquired facility\u2019s results of operations, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on reimbursement rate increases. In addition, we may have to pay cash, incur additional debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, which could adversely affect our financial results, result in dilution to our existing stockholders, result in increased fixed obligations or impede our ability to manage our operations.\nManaging growth. Some of the facilities we have acquired or may acquire in the future had or may have significantly lower operating margins than the facilities we operated prior to the time of our acquisition thereof or had or may have operating losses prior to such acquisition. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the facilities we acquire, operate such facilities profitably or effectively integrate the operations of acquired facilities, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations, react to changes in the economy or our industry and to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total debt of $319.2 million outstanding. Additionally, on March 8, 2019, we entered into that certain Credit Agreement (the \u201c2019 Senior Credit Facility\u201d) with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto for a principal loan amount of $30 million. In conjunction with that agreement, we amended our existing senior credit facility. A summary of the material terms of our indebtedness can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe have historically relied on debt financing to partially fund our acquisitions, de novo projects, facility expansions and operations, and we expect such debt financing needs to continue. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a potential competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities, and we may be unable to comply with all covenants in the future.\nOn June 30, 2017, the Company entered into a senior secured credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent and collateral agent and the lenders party thereto (the \u201c2017 Credit Facility\u201d), which we have subsequently amended on March 1, 2018 and March 8, 2019. The March 8, 2019 amendment was made in conjunction with our entrance into the 2019 Senior Credit Facility for a principal loan amount of $30 million which matures on April 15, 2020 (we refer to the \u201c2019 Senior Credit Facility,\u201d together with our 2017 Credit Facility, as our \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Our Credit Facilities impose restrictions that could impede our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to enter into certain corporate transactions, as well as increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and industry. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nredeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nenter into leases, including those in connection with sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments or investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nmake any substantial change in the nature of our business as it is currently conducted; and\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, our Credit Facilities require us to meet a senior leverage ratio financial covenant and may preclude additional borrowings. This restriction may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Our Credit Facilities also contains cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions that would apply to other material indebtedness we may have. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants in future periods will largely depend on our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be granted any waivers or amendments to our Credit Facilities if for any reason we are unable to comply with their terms in the future. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our credit facilities, which could result in the acceleration of our debt. In the event of an acceleration of our debt, we could be forced to apply all available cash flows to repay such debt and could be required to enter into insolvency proceedings.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or alternative benchmarks have performed in the past or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.\nWe have a number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments, including the Credit Facilities, with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process could\nadversely us. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future operations and growth.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding. An inability to obtain such funding, at competitive rates or at all, could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the healthcare industry or economy in general.\nAny substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our future operations and growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations.\nThe uncertainties associated with the factors described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order for us to continue operations beyond the next twelve months and to be able to discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we must do some or all of the following: (i) improve operating results by increasing census while maintaining efficiency regarding operating expenses through the cost savings initiatives implemented in late 2018 and early 2019; (ii) execute strategic alternatives related to our real-estate portfolio which could include further sale leasebacks of individual facilities or larger portions of the real estate portfolio (iii) sell additional non-core or non-essential assets; and/or (iv) obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve any or all of the foregoing.\nWe will need additional financing to execute our long-term business plan and fund operations, at which time additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nTo fund our acquisition development and operational strategies, we may consider raising additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our common or preferred stock and the procurement of commercial debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand or continue our business as desired and operating results may be adversely affected. Any debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share.\nOur ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in our industry, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. Any deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding, and we cannot be certain that we will have access to adequate capital to fund our acquisition and development strategies when needed. In addition, substantial sales of our common stock by existing stockholders could adversely affect our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenue from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to decrease the pace of, or eliminate, our acquisition strategy and potentially reduce or even cease operations.\nOur business may face significant risks with respect to future de novo expansion, including the time and costs of identifying new geographic markets, the ability to obtain necessary licensure and other zoning or regulatory approvals and significant start-up costs including advertising, marketing and the costs of providing equipment, furnishings, supplies and other capital resources.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop new substance abuse treatment facilities in existing and new markets, either by building a new facility or by acquiring an existing facility with an alternative use and repurposing it as a substance abuse treatment facility. Such de novo expansion involves significant risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying locations in suitable geographic markets, which may divert management attention from existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of changes to comprehensive zoning plans or zoning regulations that imposes additional restrictions on use or requirements, which could impact our expansion into otherwise suitable geographic markets;\n\u2022\nthe need for significant advertising and marketing expenditures to attract clients;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide each de novo facility with the appropriate equipment, furnishings, materials, supplies and other capital resources;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain licensure and accreditation, establish relationships with healthcare providers in the community and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems;\n\u2022\nthe costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local physicians, management and staff and opening new facilities, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient revenue to support the costs of the expansion; and\n\u2022\nour ability to finance de novo expansion and possible dilution to our existing stockholders if our common stock is used as consideration.\nAs a result of these and other risks, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop de novo treatment facilities or that a de novo treatment facility will become profitable; such expansion could expose us to liabilities or loss.\nOur ability to maintain census is dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, and if we are unable to maintain census, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur revenue is directly impacted by our ability to maintain census. These metrics are dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including our referral relationships, average length of stay of our clients, the extent to which third-party payors require preadmission authorization or utilization review controls, competition in the industry and the decisions of our clients to seek and commit to treatment. Further, our census depends upon the effectiveness of our multi-faceted marketing program. See above, Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cWe rely on our multi-faceted sales and marketing program to continuously attract and enroll clients in our network of facilities. Our sales and marketing program includes the use of digital media, including our recovery resource websites that provide information about addiction treatment and connect website visitors with our helpline. Any disruption in our national sales and marketing program, including our digital marketing resources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d A significant decrease in census could materially adversely affect our revenue, profitability and cash flows due to fewer or lower reimbursements received, and the additional resources required to collect accounts receivable and to maintain our existing level of business.\nGiven the client-driven nature of the substance abuse treatment sector, our business is dependent on clients seeking and committing to treatment. Although increased awareness and de-stigmatization of substance abuse treatment in recent years has resulted in more people seeking treatment, the decision of each client to seek treatment is ultimately discretionary. In addition, even after the initial decision to seek treatment, our clients may decide at any time to discontinue treatment and leave our facilities against the advice of our physicians and other treatment professionals. For this reason, among others, average length of stay can vary among periods without correlating to the overall operating performance of our business. If clients or potential clients decide not to seek treatment or discontinue treatment early, census could decrease and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry where competition may lead to declines in client volumes and an increase in labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe substance abuse treatment industry is highly competitive, and competition among substance abuse treatment providers (including behavioral healthcare facilities) for clients has intensified in recent years. In 2018, there were approximately 4,200 substance abuse treatment businesses in the United States. There are behavioral healthcare facilities that provide substance abuse and other mental health treatment services comparable to at least some of the services offered by our facilities in each of the geographical areas in which we operate. Some of our competitors are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may have certain financial advantages not available to us, including endowments, charitable contributions, tax-exempt financing and exemptions from sales, property and income taxes. In some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than we do. Some of our competitors are local, independent operators or physician groups with strong established reputations within the surrounding communities, which may adversely affect our ability to attract new patients in markets where we compete with such providers. If our competitors are better able to attract clients, expand services or obtain favorable participation agreements with third-party payors, we may experience a decline in client volume, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management team, physicians and medical support personnel, including our nurses, mental health technicians, therapists, addiction counselors, pharmacists and clinical technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management, mental health technicians, therapists, nurses, counselors, and other support personnel responsible for the daily operations of our facilities. The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing our industry in recent years. This shortage may require us to enhance our wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline and we could experience a decline in client volume, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs. A labor union represents our employees at Sunrise House. As a result, with respect to our Sunrise House facilities, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns and other labor-relations matters. Although we are not aware of any union organizing activity at any of our other facilities, we are unable to predict whether any such activity will take place in the future.\nWe depend heavily on key executives and other key management personnel, and the departure of one or more of our key executives or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe expertise and efforts of our key executives, including our chief executive officer, and other management personnel are critical to the success of our business. We do not currently have employment agreements or non-compete covenants with any of our key executives. The loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities. Furthermore, if one or more of our key executives were to terminate employment with us and engage in a competing business, we would be subject to increased competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks and any other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain a trademark portfolio that we consider to be of significant importance to our business, and we may acquire additional trademarks or other proprietary rights in acquisitions that we pursue as part of our growth strategy. If the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequate to prevent imitation of our services by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our services as an alleged violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights, it may be necessary for us to initiate or enter into litigation in the future to enforce our trademark rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others. The cost of any such legal proceedings could be expensive and such legal proceedings could result in an adverse determination that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price. As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of New York Stock Exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in our financial statements could be impacted as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur incremental costs in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting and comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including increased auditing and legal fees.\nManagement\u2019s determination that a material weakness exists in our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company\u2019s has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as noted in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nBased on the evaluation of this material weakness, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2018 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on a number of factors, our internal review that identified restatements to our previously issued financial statements, and efforts to develop a detailed plan and timetable for the implementation of measures designed to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented, in conformity with GAAP. Pending the Company\u2019s remediation of the matters that have caused the control deficiencies underlying the material weakness, our business and results of operations could be harmed, we may be unable to report properly or timely the results of our operations, and investors may lose faith in the reliability of our financial statements. Accordingly, the price of our securities may be adversely and materially impacted.\nWe could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAt December 31, 2018, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $211.0 million. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we are required to write down the carrying value of these assets. We conduct a review at least annually to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive laws and government regulations impacting our industry, we could suffer penalties, be the subject of federal and state investigations or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which may reduce our revenue, increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare service providers are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification and accreditation of substance use treatment services;\n\u2022\nlicensure, CLIA certification and accreditation of laboratory services;\n\u2022\nhandling, administration and distribution of controlled substances;\n\u2022\nnecessity and adequacy of care and quality of services;\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification and qualifications of professional and support personnel;\n\u2022\nreferrals of clients and permissible relationships with physicians and other referral sources;\n\u2022\nclaim submission and collections, including penalties for the submission of, or causing the submission of, false, fraudulent or misleading claims and the failure to repay overpayments in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nextensive conditions of participation for Medicare and Medicaid programs\n\u2022\nconsumer protection issues and billing and collection of client-owed accounts issues;\n\u2022\ncommunications with clients and consumers, including laws intended to prevent misleading marketing practices;\n\u2022\nprivacy and security of health-related information, client personal information and medical records;\n\u2022\nphysical plant planning, construction of new facilities and expansion of existing facilities;\n\u2022\nactivities regarding competitors;\n\u2022\nFDA laws and regulations related to drugs and medical devices;\n\u2022\noperational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety of employees;\n\u2022\nhandling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens and infectious and hazardous waste;\n\u2022\ncorporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, self-referral and kickback prohibitions, including recent state and federal laws intended to eliminate bribes and kickbacks; and\n\u2022\nthe SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which became law on October 24, 2018.\nThe United States has recently enacted the EKRA to create a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (1) soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) paying or offering any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Certain states, including Florida, have enacted similar laws, or will likely enact similar laws in the future.\nAs a provider of addiction treatment services, we are subject to governmental investigations and potential claims and lawsuits by clients, employees and others, which may increase our costs, cause reputational issues and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and reputation.\nGiven the addiction and mental health issues of clients and the nature of the services provided, the substance abuse treatment industry is heavily regulated by governmental agencies and involves significant risk of liability. We and others in our industry are exposed to the risk of governmental investigations, regulatory actions and whistleblower lawsuits or other claims against us and our\nphysicians and other professionals arising out of our day to day business operations, including, without limitation, client treatment at our facilities and relationships with healthcare providers that may refer clients to us. Addressing any investigation, lawsuit or other claim may distract management and divert resources, even if we ultimately prevail. Regardless of the outcome of any such investigation, lawsuit or claim, the publicity and potential risks associated with the investigation, lawsuit or claim could harm our reputation or the reputation of our management and negatively impact the perception of the Company by clients, investors or others and could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Fines, restrictions, penalties and damages imposed as a result of an investigation or a successful lawsuit or claim that is not covered by, or is in excess of, our insurance coverage may increase our costs and reduce our profitability. Our insurance premiums have increased year over year, and insurance coverage may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future, especially given the significant increase in insurance premiums generally experienced in the healthcare industry.\nWe are also subject to an inherent risk of potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other potential claims or legal actions in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, we are subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a client that we failed to follow internal or external procedures that resulted in death or harm to a client or that our employees mistreated our clients, resulting in death or harm. Any deficiencies in the quality of care provided by our employees could expose to governmental investigations and lawsuits from our patients. Some of these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect that findings in such lawsuits may have on us. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may decide to negotiate a settlement, and amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material. All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. We believe that, based on our past experience, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising from the operation of our facilities. While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted in the future or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe care for a large number of clients with complex medical conditions, special needs or who require a substantial level of care and supervision. There is an inherent risk that our clients could be harmed while in treatment, whether through negligence, by accident or otherwise. Further, clients might engage in behavior that results in harm to themselves, our employees or to one or more other individuals. Patient safety incidents may result in regulatory enforcement actions, negative press about us or the addiction treatment industry generally and lawsuits filed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers against us. These developments could diminish public perception of the quality of our services, which in turn could lead to a loss of client placements and referrals, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, loss of license or certification or require us to change our operations, or the exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Both federal and state government agencies as well as commercial payors have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare organizations.\nWe endeavor to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business. We seek to structure all of our relationships with referral sources and clients to comply with applicable anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws, fee-splitting laws and state corporate practice of medicine prohibitions. We monitor these laws and their implementing regulations and implement changes as necessary. However, the laws and regulations in these areas are complex and often subject to varying interpretations. For example, if an enforcement agency were to challenge the compensation paid under our contracts with professional physician groups, we could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result.\nWe may be required to spend substantial amounts to comply with legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to privacy and security of client health information.\nThere are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing client privacy and security concerns. In particular, the Part 2 Regulations restrict the disclosure, and regulate the security, of client identifiable information related to substance abuse. These requirements apply to any of our facilities that receive federal assistance, which is interpreted broadly to include facilities licensed, certified or registered by a federal agency. In addition, the federal privacy and security regulations issued under HIPAA require our facilities to comply with extensive requirements on the use and disclosure of protected health information and to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic protected health information. These regulations also provide clients with substantive rights with respect to their health information and impose substantial administrative obligations on our facilities, including the requirement to enter into written agreements with contractors, known as business associates, to whom our programs disclose protected health information. We may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be our agent. Covered entities must notify individuals, HHS and, in some cases, the media of breaches involving unsecured protected health information. HHS and state attorneys general are authorized to enforce these\nregulations. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, and data breaches and other HIPAA violations may give rise to class action lawsuits by affected clients under state law.\nOur programs remain subject to any privacy-related federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. These laws vary by state and may impose additional requirements and penalties. For example, some states impose strict restrictions on the use and disclosure of health information pertaining to mental health or substance abuse. Further, most states have enacted laws and regulations that require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission may use its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches or other privacy or security lapses.\nAs public attention is drawn to issues related to the privacy and security of medical and other personal information, federal and state authorities may increase enforcement efforts, seek to impose harsher penalties as well as revise and expand laws or enact new laws concerning these topics. Compliance with current as well as any newly established provisions or interpretations of existing requirements will require us to expend significant resources. Increased focus on privacy and security issues by enforcement authorities may increase the overall risk that our substance abuse treatment facilities may be found lacking under federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations.\nOur treatment facilities operate in an environment of increasing state and federal enforcement activity and private litigation targeted at healthcare providers.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated their civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and various segments of the healthcare industry. These investigations relate to a wide variety of topics, including relationships with physicians, billing practices and use of controlled substances. The Affordable Care Act included an additional $350 million of federal funding over ten years to fight healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, including $10 million for each of federal fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The HHS Office of Inspector General and the Department of Justice have established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. Some of our facilities participate in Medicare or Medicaid and, therefore, could be subject to government investigation. Furthermore, even though we operate a number of facilities that do not currently bill Medicare or Medicaid for substance use treatment services, there is a risk that specific investigative initiatives or new laws such as EKRA could result in investigations or enforcement actions that include or affect our treatment services, laboratory service providers, or marketing operations. In addition, increased government enforcement activities, even if not directed towards our treatment facilities or laboratories, also increase the risk that our facilities, physicians and other clinicians furnishing services in our facilities, or our executives and directors, could be named as defendants in private litigation such as state or federal false claims act cases or consumer protection cases, or could become the subject of complaints at the various state and federal agencies that have jurisdiction over our operations. Any governmental investigations, private litigation or other legal proceedings involving any of our facilities or laboratories, our executives or our directors, even if we ultimately prevail, could result in significant expense, adversely affect our reputation or profitability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. In addition, we may be required to make changes in our laboratory, substance use treatment services or marketing or other operational practices as a result of an adverse determination in any governmental enforcement action, private litigation or other legal proceeding, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges to federal, state and local regulations, as well as different or new interpretations of existing regulations, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nBecause our treatment programs and operations are regulated at federal, state and local levels, we could be affected by regulatory changes in different regional markets. Increases in the costs of regulatory compliance and the risks of noncompliance may increase our operating costs, and we may not be able to recover these increased costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nMany of the current laws and regulations are relatively new, including the EKRA and recent state laws intended to prohibit deceptive marketing practices in the addiction treatment industry. Thus, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. Evolving interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our treatment facilities, equipment, personnel, services or capital expenditure programs. A determination that we have violated these laws, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could adversely affect our business, operating results and overall reputation in the marketplace.\nIn addition, federal, state and local regulations may be enacted that impose additional requirements on our facilities. Adoption of legislation or the creation of new regulations affecting our facilities could increase our operating costs, restrain our growth or limit us from taking advantage of opportunities presented and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse changes in existing comprehensive zoning plans or zoning regulations that impose additional restrictions on the use of, or requirements applicable to, our facilities may affect our ability to operate our existing facilities or acquire new facilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to uncertainties regarding the direction and impact of healthcare reform efforts, particularly efforts to repeal or significantly modify the Affordable Care Act.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, scientific and technological changes, which have resulted and may continue to result in initiatives intended to reform the industry. The most prominent of recent efforts, the Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, provides for increased access to coverage for healthcare and seeks to reduce healthcare-related expenses. Among other mandates, it requires all new small group and individual market health plans to cover ten essential health benefit categories, which currently include substance abuse addiction and mental health disorder services. However, efforts by the executive branch and some members of Congress to repeal or make fundamental changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation and/or its interpretation have cast significant uncertainty on the future of the law. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 2019, which may affect rates of insurance coverage. We are unable to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act and related regulations or the impact of its repeal or modification on our operations in light of the uncertainty regarding whether or how the law will be changed, what alternative reforms, if any, may be enacted or what other actions may be taken. Any government efforts related to health reform may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Moreover, the general uncertainty of health reform efforts, particularly if Congress elects to repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act but delays the implementation of repeal or fails to enact replacement provisions at the time of repeal, may negatively impact our payment sources or demand for our services.\nThe expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act has been beneficial to the substance abuse treatment industry. This is due, in part, to higher demand for treatment services, which resulted from the requirement that small group and individual market plans comply with the requirements of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which previously applied only to group health plans and group insurers. The 21st Century Cures Act requires development of an action plan for enhanced enforcement of mental health parity requirements and additional guidance for health plans regarding compliance with parity laws. Increased demand for treatment services may bring new competitors to the market, some of which may be better capitalized and have greater market penetration than we do. In addition, we expect increased demand for substance use treatment services to increase the demand for case managers, therapists, medical technicians and others with clinical expertise in substance abuse treatment, which may make it more difficult to adequately staff our substance abuse treatment facilities and could significantly increase our costs in delivering treatment, which may adversely affect both our operations and profitability.\nOne of the many impacts of the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation has been a dramatic increase in payment reform efforts by federal and state government payors as well as commercial payors. These efforts take many forms, including the growth of accountable care organizations, pay-for-performance bonus arrangements, partial capitation arrangements and the bundling of services into a single payment. One result of these efforts is that more risk of the overall cost of care is being transferred to providers. As institutional providers and their affiliated physicians assume more risk for the cost of care, we expect more services to be furnished within provider networks that are formed for these types of payment arrangements. Our ability to compete and to retain our traditional sources of clients may be adversely affected by our exclusion from such networks or our inability to be included in such networks.\nChange of ownership or change of control requirements imposed by state and federal licensure and certification agencies as well as third-party payors may limit our ability to timely realize opportunities, adversely affect our licenses and certifications, interrupt our cash flows and adversely affect our profitability.\nState licensure laws and many federal healthcare programs (where applicable) impose a number of obligations on healthcare providers undergoing a change of ownership or change of control transaction. These requirements may require new license applications as well as notices given a fixed number of days prior to the closing of affected transactions. These provisions require us to be proactive when considering both internal restructuring and acquisitions of other treatment companies. Failure to provide such notices or to submit required paperwork can adversely affect licensure on a going forward basis, can subject the parties to penalties and can adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities.\nMany third-party payor agreements, including government payor programs, also have change of ownership or change of control provisions. Such provisions generally include a prior notice provision as well as require the consent of the payor in order to continue the terms of the payor agreement. Abiding by the terms of such provisions may reopen pricing negotiations with third-party payors where the provider currently has favorable reimbursement terms as compared to the market. Failure to comply with the terms of such provisions can result in a breach of the underlying third-party payor agreement. Currently, we relatively have few third-party payor agreements; however, as substance abuse treatment coverage and payment reform initiatives continue to expand, these types of provisions could have a significant impact on our ability to realize opportunities and could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability.\nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of healthcare facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our facilities.\nThe construction of new healthcare facilities, the expansion, transfer or change of ownership of existing facilities and the addition of new beds, services or equipment may be subject to state laws that require a determination of public need and prior approval by state regulatory agencies under CON laws or other healthcare planning initiatives. Review of CONs and similar proposals may be lengthy and may require public hearings. States in which we now or may in the future operate may require CONs under certain\ncircumstances not currently applicable to us or may impose standards and other health planning requirements upon us. Violation of these state laws and our failure to obtain any necessary state approval could:\n\u2022\nresult in our inability to acquire a targeted facility, complete a desired expansion or make a desired replacement; or\n\u2022\nresult in the revocation of a facility\u2019s license or imposition of civil or criminal penalties on us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain required regulatory, zoning or other required approvals for renovations and expansions, our growth may be restrained, and our operating results may be adversely affected. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from such requirements, but we cannot predict their future impact on our operations.\nWe could face risks associated with, or arising out of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that:\n\u2022\nregulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the generation, handling and disposal of medical and pharmaceutical wastes;\n\u2022\nimpose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site and other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and\n\u2022\nregulate workplace safety.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations could increase our costs of operation. Violation of these laws may subject us to significant fines, penalties or disposal costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We could be responsible for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions at currently or formerly operated or leased sites, as well as for associated liabilities, including liabilities for natural resource damages, third-party property damage or personal injury resulting from lawsuits that could be brought by the government or private litigants relating to our operations, the operations of our facilities or the land on which our facilities are located. We may be subject to these liabilities regardless of whether we lease or own the facility, and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant, or by a third-party or a neighboring facility whose operations may have affected such facility or land, because liability for contamination under certain environmental laws can be imposed on current or past owners or operators of a site without regard to fault. We cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing or future sites or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement the compliance program requirements imposed by the State of California.\nOn October 21, 2016, we entered into a Permanent Injunction and Final Judgement (\u201cPIFJ\u201d) relating to the criminal charges filed in connection with the death of a client in 2010 at one of our former locations. Pursuant to the terms of the PIFJ, we were required to, among other things, (i) institute the (\u201cCalifornia Compliance Program\u201d) with respect to our California facilities that includes maintaining or developing and implementing certain policies and procedures to promote each covered facility\u2019s compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and the PIFJ, under the responsibility of our chief compliance officer; (ii) establish a compliance committee composed of the compliance officer and senior personnel responsible for overseeing clinical operations and (iii) establish an oversight committee of the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of Directors, to review the adequacy and responsiveness of the California Compliance Program. In addition, we are required to retain a qualified independent monitor through April 25, 2019 to assess the effectiveness of our quality control systems and patient care.\nSince 2016, we have incurred costs in connection with the implementation of and compliance under the California Compliance Program and PIFJ, and expect to incur additional costs in connection with the California Compliance Program and with the PIFJ. The Company has been subject to the California Compliance Program for more than two years and continues to comply with its obligations and interactions with the Compliance Officer. Such efforts will be ongoing during the full term of the California Compliance Program. If we are not able to successfully fulfill our obligations under the California Compliance Program or timely implement recommendations made by the Compliance Officer in connection with the California Compliance Program, the BMFEA may pursue remedies under the PIFJ, including assessment of fines and civil and criminal actions. Should the BMFEA pursue remedies under the PIFJ, we could face significant fines and actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to tax liabilities, including federal and state taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. If we are required to pay additional taxes, our costs would increase,\nand our net income would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d which includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur directors, executive officers and certain employees and their respective affiliates have substantial control over the company and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur directors, executive officers and certain employees owned, in the aggregate, approximately 33.1% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. Michael T. Cartwright, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and his affiliates owned approximately 19.4% of our common stock as of December 31, 2018. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have substantial control over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, will continue to have significant influence over the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Nevada law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which we refer to as our bylaws, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions:\n\u2022\npermit our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022\nprovide that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose); and\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors or the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of voting stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2019. If some investors find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for implementing new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "PERMNO": 14945, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "AACH"}
