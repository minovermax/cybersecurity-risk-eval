{"cik": "1665918", "company": "US Foods Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Some of these risks and uncertainties, including those described below, may cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to vary, and they may materially or adversely affect our financial performance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, which are not currently known to us or which we currently believe are immaterial, may also materially or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nAn economic downturn, public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or other factors affecting consumer spending and confidence, may reduce the amount of food prepared away from home, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. foodservice distribution industry is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions. An uneven level of general U.S. economic activity, uncertainty in the financial markets, inflation, and supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending. A decline in economic activity or the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home, as well as other macroenvironmental factors that could decrease general consumer confidence (including volatile financial markets or an uncertain political environment), may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and its significant effect on the economy have impacted and is expected to continue to impact many of our customers, consumers and suppliers. Widespread adoption of social distancing, masking and testing measures and public concerns about the risks associated with COVID-19 infection have resulted in substantial disruption to many of our customers\u2019 operations (including the limitation of dining options and the temporary (and, in some cases, permanent) closure of many restaurant, hospitality and education customers\u2019 locations) which resulted in a significant reduction in the demand for our products and services. Sustained disruption in our customers\u2019 operations and reduced consumer spending on food prepared away from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative effect on our customers\u2019 financial condition and, as a result, has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not expect a full recovery for our business and the U.S. foodservice industry until consumers are once again willing and able to resume consumption of food away from home, travel and attend sporting, entertainment and other events on a regular basis. We may continue to face challenges as the recovery continues, such as constraints on the availability of product supply, increased product and logistics costs, labor shortages, and shifts in the buying patterns of our customers. General economic conditions, such as inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and uncertainty regarding when the COVID-19 pandemic will abate, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending which will likely slow the recovery of the U.S. foodservice industry. Multiple factors could negatively impact the timing and extent of the industry\u2019s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic including the rate of vaccine adoption, the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 variants (and the continued effectiveness of the vaccines against those variants) and the duration and implications of continued restrictions and safety measures. If the restaurant and/or hospitality industry is fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are detrimental to us, our business may continue to be adversely affected even as the broader economy continues to recover.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the business and financial results of our Company and our customers, it may also have the effect of amplifying many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a significant negative impact on our liquidity position.\nSustained disruption in our customers\u2019 operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative effect on our customers\u2019 financial condition and could result in deterioration in the collectability of our existing accounts receivable and a decrease in the generation of new accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations and require an increased level of working capital. In addition, our ability to borrow under our asset based senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) is subject to a borrowing base limitation that is based on certain criteria, including the amount and collectability of new accounts receivable. Thus, a decline in the amount and collectability of our accounts receivable not only adversely affects our cash flows and results of operations, but also reduces our access to additional liquidity due its negative impact on the borrowing base of the ABL Facility. Furthermore, the negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our Adjusted EBITDA could constrain our future ability to incur additional indebtedness under the incurrence \u201cbaskets\u201d of our debt agreements that are based on a leverage ratio or coverage ratio calculation.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has previously adversely affected, and in the future may again adversely affect, the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms, especially the longer the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lasts.\nWe believe that the combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with borrowing capacity under the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements, will be adequate to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We cannot, however, assure you that this will be the case. Any future significant reduction to our liquidity position caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could impair our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness and pay our other payables as they become due.\nOur business is a low-margin business, and our profitability is directly affected by cost deflation or inflation, commodity volatility and other factors.\nThe U.S. foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. Volatile commodity costs have a direct impact on our industry. We make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell, plus a margin percentage or markup. As a result, our profit levels may be negatively affected during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation, or periods of rapid inflation, also may negatively impact our business as a result of decreased discretionary consumer spending. Such inflation may also reduce our profit margins and earnings if there is a lag between when costs increase and when we are able to pass it along to customers or if product cost increases cannot be passed on to customers because they resist paying higher prices.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe U.S. foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive, with national, multi-regional, regional and local distributors and specialty competitors. Regional and local companies may align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups, with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies, and ability to meet customer distribution requirements. These distributors may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage, and they may have a lower cost to serve and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity. Additionally, adjacent competition, such as other cash-and-carry operations, commercial wholesale outlets, warehouse clubs and grocery stores, continue to serve the commercial foodservice market. We also experience competition from online direct food wholesalers and retailers. We generally do not have exclusive distribution agreements with our customers, and they may switch to other distributors that offer lower prices or differentiated products or customer service. The cost of switching distributors is very low, as are the barriers to entry into the U.S. foodservice distribution industry. We believe most purchasing decisions in the U.S. foodservice distribution industry are based on the type, quality and price of the product and a distributor\u2019s ability to completely and accurately fill orders and provide timely deliveries. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related labor shortages that impact our ability to completely and accurately fill orders and provide timely deliveries of quality products at competitive prices have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased competition has caused the U.S. foodservice distribution industry to change as distributors seek to lower costs, further increasing pressure on the industry\u2019s profit margins. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may further increase those competitive pressures including as a result of constraints on product availability from our suppliers, disruptions to timely and cost effective shipments from our suppliers due to labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, increased freight demand and/or tightened truckload capacity, new pricing initiatives and discount programs established by competitors, consolidation and vertical integration, and increased customer cost consciousness. Any or all of these competitive pressures may continue to affect us during the recovery of the U.S. foodservice distribution industry from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent we are not able to compete successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third party suppliers, and our business may be affected by interruption of supplies or increases in product costs.\nWe obtain most of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers. We typically do not have long-term contracts with suppliers. Although our purchasing volume can provide an advantage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies we need in the quantities and at the time and prices requested. We do not control the actual production of most of the products we sell. This means we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on actions and conditions outside our control including the continuing challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions and conditions include changes in supplier pricing practices (including promotional allowances); labor shortages, work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers; government shutdowns; severe weather and climate conditions; crop conditions; product or raw material scarcity; water shortages; outbreak of food-borne illnesses; product recalls; transportation interruptions; unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs; competitive demands; impact of climate change; and natural disasters, pandemics, such as COVID-19, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products because of any of these or other factors could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to our customers and, as a result, our customers may turn to other distributors.\nOur relationships with our customers and GPOs may be materially diminished, terminated or otherwise changed, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our customers buy from us pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we often do not enter into long-term agreements with these customers. Because these customers are not contractually obligated to continue purchasing products from us, we cannot be assured that the volume and/or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders will remain consistent or increase or that we will be able to maintain our existing customer base.\nFurther, some of our customers purchase their products under arrangements with GPOs. GPOs act as agents on behalf of their members by negotiating pricing, delivery, and other terms with us. Our customers who are members of GPOs purchase products directly from us on the terms negotiated by their GPO. GPOs use the combined purchasing power of their members to negotiate more favorable prices than their members would typically be able to negotiate on their own, and we have experienced some pricing pressure from customers that associate themselves with a GPO. While no single customer represented more than 2% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2021, approximately 19% of our net sales in fiscal year 2021 were made to customers under terms negotiated by GPOs (including approximately 11% of our net sales in fiscal year 2021 that were made to customers that are members of one GPO). If an independent restaurant customer becomes a member of a GPO that has a contract with us, we may be forced to lower our prices to that customer, which would negatively impact our operating margin. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our relationships with GPOs, or if GPOs are able to negotiate more favorable terms for their members with our competitors, we could lose some or all of that business.\nMarket competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers and acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand our relationships with customers and GPOs. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers or GPOs on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers. For example, in fiscal year 2021, customers in the hospitality industry who were members of GPOs with which we have contracted significantly reduced their purchases as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not expect them to significantly increase their purchases until the hospitality industry recovers from the current environment. Our customer and GPO agreements are generally terminable upon advance written notice (typically ranging from 30 days to 6 months) by either us or the customer or GPO, which provides our customers and GPOs with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors.\nSignificant decreases in the number and/or size of our customers\u2019 purchase orders, the loss of one or more of our major customers or GPOs or our inability to grow to our current customer base could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to increase or maintain the highest margin portions of our business, including sales to independent restaurant customers and sales of our private label products.\nOur most profitable customers are independent restaurants. We tend to work closely with independent restaurant customers, providing them access to our customer value-added tools, and as a result are able to earn a higher operating margin on sales to them. These customers are also more likely to purchase our private label products, which are our most profitable products. Our ability to continue to gain market share of independent restaurant customers is critical to achieving increased operating profits. Changes in the buying practices of independent restaurant customers, including their ability to require us to sell to them at discounted rates, or decreases in our sales to this type of customer or a decrease in the sales of our private label products could have a material negative impact on our profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial disruption in many of our independent restaurant customers\u2019 operations (including, reduced seating capacity, inability to seat customers indoors, labor shortages, wage inflation, reduced hours of operations, and temporary restaurant closures) and, in some cases, permanent closures of restaurants. Loss of business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative economic impact has changed the buying practices of our independent restaurant customers and may also result in additional permanent closures of restaurants, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect from our cost savings initiatives.\nWe may not be able to realize some or all of our expected cost savings. A variety of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, and unexpected costs associated with operating our business. All of these factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel costs fluctuate, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher costs of fuel may negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. This may reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. In addition, higher costs of fuel may increase the price we pay for products and the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers. We require significant quantities of fuel for our vehicle fleet, and\nthe price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Although, from time to time, we enter into forward purchase commitments for some of our fuel requirements at prices equal to the then-current market price, these forward purchases may prove ineffective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices or even result in us paying higher than market costs for part of our fuel. There is no guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased fuel costs to customers in the future. These factors may, in turn, adversely affect our sales, margins, operating expenses, and operating results.\nChanges in consumer eating habits may reduce demand for our products.\nChanges in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers) could reduce demand for our products. Consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors, including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. There is a growing consumer preference for sustainable, organic and locally grown products. Changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts. Millennials, the largest demographic group in the U.S. in terms of spend, generally seek new and different, as well as more ethnic and diverse, menu options and menu innovation. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home. Additionally, changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to make additional disclosure regarding the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance with these and other laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming. If we are not able to effectively adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits or respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, actions taken by national, state and local governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel restrictions or bans, social distancing requirements, restaurant seating capacity limitations, and required closures of non-essential businesses caused a significant decline in consumers\u2019 consumption of food away from home. Even when the aforementioned restrictions were eased, public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 and its variants caused and could continue to cause some consumers to continue to avoid or limit gatherings in restaurants and other public places and reduce or eliminate business or personal travel, each of which could continue to impact our restaurant and hospitality customers and reduce demand for our products. As a result, we do not expect a full recovery for our business and the U.S. foodservice industry until consumers are once again willing and able to resume consumption of food away from home, travel and attend sporting, entertainment and other events on a regular basis.\nIf our competitors implement a lower cost structure and offer lower prices to our customers, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to compete profitably and retain those customers.\nOver the last several decades, the U.S. food retail industry has undergone significant change. Club stores, commercial wholesale outlets, direct food wholesalers and online food retailers have developed lower cost structures, creating increased pressure on the industry\u2019s profit margins. As a large-scale U.S. foodservice distributor, we have similar strategies to remain competitive in the marketplace by reducing our cost structure. However, to the extent more of our competitors adopt an everyday low-price strategy, we would potentially be pressured to offer lower prices to our customers. That would require us to achieve additional cost savings to offset these reductions. If we are unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in that environment, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nImpairment charges for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. Relevant factors, events and circumstances that affect the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations. For example, the Company completed its most recent annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 4, 2021, the first day of the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result of rebranding initiatives related to the integration of a trade name acquired as part of the 2019 Food Group acquisition, we recognized an impairment charge of $7 million. Impairment analysis requires significant judgment by management and is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used, such as future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates as well as current market conditions in both the United States and globally, all of which are being unfavorably impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that business conditions deteriorate further, or if changes in key assumptions and estimates differ significantly from\nmanagement\u2019s expectations, it may be necessary to record additional future impairment charges, which could be material. For more information on the goodwill assessment and related impairment charge, see the section captioned \u201cValuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, in our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Relating to Product Safety and Regulatory Requirements\nOur business is subject to significant governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations may lead to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations.\nIn the course of our operations, we process, handle, store and transport a wide variety of food and non-food products, operate and maintain vehicle fleets, operate forklifts, store fuel in on-site aboveground and underground storage tanks, and use and dispose of hazardous substances including in connection with our use of our ammonia or freon-based refrigeration systems, propane, and battery-powered forklifts. Our operations are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations including regulations governing the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as rights of our employees and the protection of the environment. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements, revised regulatory requirements for the processing and packaging of food products and requirements to phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances or otherwise regulating greenhouse gas emissions), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations including costs to upgrade or replace products or equipment that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation regarding our relationship with our employees including minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour, employment discrimination, harassment and immigration. Due to contracts we have with federal and state governmental entities as customers, we are subject to audits of, or requests for information regarding, our employment practices and business operations. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC, OSHA and various other federal, state, and local authorities have issued guidance, new interpretations of existing requirements, and implemented new requirements for employers that affect the operation of our facilities and the management of our workforce. The various federal, state and local requirements and guidance continue to evolve, but we are continually monitoring for updates and responding to updated requirements and guidance applicable to our business as we become aware of them.\nAt several current and former facilities, we are investigating and remediating known or suspected contamination from historical releases of fuel and other hazardous substances that is not currently the subject of any administrative or judicial proceeding, but we may be subject to administrative or judicial proceedings in the future for contamination related to releases of fuel or other hazardous substances.\nFailing to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, or encountering disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulation, could result in a number of adverse situations. These could include investigations; litigation or other legal proceedings; administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; mandatory or voluntary product recalls; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closing facilities or operations; debarments from contracting with governmental entities; and loss or modification of existing, or denial of additional, licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals.\nIf the products we distribute are alleged to cause injury, illness or other damage or to fail to comply with applicable governmental regulations, we may need to recall products.\nAs a distributor and manufacturer of food and non-food products, we may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if the products we distribute or manufacture are alleged to cause injury, illness or other damage, to have been mislabeled, misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise violate applicable governmental regulations. We may recall products based on alleged occurrences of food-borne illnesses (such as E. coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, salmonella or swine flu) and food tampering. We may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards, whether for taste, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation.\nAny future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation and/or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If patrons of our customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close locations and our sales would correspondingly decrease.\nWe may experience product liability claims.\nWe may be exposed to potential product liability claims in the event that the products we distribute or manufacture are alleged to have caused injury, illness or other damage. We believe we have sufficient liability insurance to cover product liability claims. We also generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying products to us. If our current insurance does not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or is inadequate to cover all of our liabilities, or if our indemnification or insurance\ncoverage is limited, as a practical matter, by the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party or the insured limits of our suppliers\u2019 insurance coverage, the liability related to allegedly defective products that we distribute or manufacture could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact our reputation and business.\nMaintaining a good reputation and the safety and integrity of the products we distribute is critical to our business, particularly in selling our private label products. Product recalls, occurrences of food-borne illness or food tampering may cause negative publicity about the quality, safety, sustainability or integrity of our products, whether or not such events are related to our products. Any event that damages our reputation or calls into question the safety or integrity of our products, whether justified or not, could quickly and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital or obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business, and make required payments on our debt.\nWe had $5.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding, as of January 1, 2022.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our debt facilities depends on our ongoing financial and operating performance, among other things, and may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control, including as discussed under the caption \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d above. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional equity capital or restructure our debt. However, there is no assurance that such alternative measures may be successful or permitted under the agreements governing our indebtedness and, as a result, we may not be able to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because approximately 47% of the net principal amount of our indebtedness accrued interest at variable rates of interest as of January 1, 2022;\n\u2022it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or lower debt service requirements and they, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand competitive pressures and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; and\n\u2022our ability to refinance indebtedness and obtain additional financing may be limited or the associated costs of refinancing and obtaining additional financing may increase.\nOur level of indebtedness may further increase from time to time. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness, including secured debt, that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Incurring substantial additional indebtedness could further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that may significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: dispose of assets; incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness); pay dividends and make certain payments; create liens on assets; make investments; engage in certain business combination transactions; engage in certain transactions with\naffiliates; change the business we conduct; and amend specific debt agreements. In addition, certain of these agreements subject us to various financial covenants.\nThe restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive and financial covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers of or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with them, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness depends on our ongoing financial and operating performance, among other things, and may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control, including as discussed under the caption \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d above. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that would permit the applicable lenders or note holders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay debt, creditors having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under our credit facilities and may not be able to repay the amounts due under our indebtedness. This could have serious consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of servicing our debt.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it will cease publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors as of June 30, 2023, for the most common tenors (overnight and one, three, six and twelve months) and it will cease publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors for less common tenors (one week and two months) as well as all tenors of non-U.S. dollar LIBOR as of December 31, 2021. Amounts drawn under each of our ABL Facility and incremental senior secured term loan facilities may bear interest at rates based upon, among other things, U.S. dollar LIBOR. As such, we will need to renegotiate certain standards in, or terms of the agreements governing this indebtedness to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new standard, or we may be required to borrow this indebtedness based upon alternate interest rate conventions as set forth in those agreements, which could increase the cost of servicing this debt and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital Management\nWe face risks related to labor relations and increases in labor costs.\nWe employed approximately 28,000 associates as of January 1, 2022, of which approximately 5,900 were members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. Our failure to effectively renegotiate any CBAs could result in work stoppages. From time to time, we may face increased efforts to subject us to multi-location labor disputes, as individual labor agreements expire or labor disputes arise. This would place us at greater risk of being unable to continue to operate one or more facilities, possibly delaying deliveries, causing customers to seek alternative distributors, or otherwise being materially adversely affected by labor disputes. When there are labor related issues at a facility represented by a local union, sympathy strikes may occur at other facilities that are represented by other local unions. While we generally believe we have good relations with our associates, including the unions that represent some of our associates, a work stoppage due to a failure to renegotiate union contracts or for other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, potential changes in labor legislation and case law could result in current non-union portions of our workforce, including warehouse and delivery personnel, being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If additional portions of our workforce became subject to CBAs, this could result in increased costs of doing business as we would become subject to mandatory, binding arbitration or labor scheduling, costs and standards, which may reduce our operating flexibility.\nWe are subject to a wide range of labor costs. Because our industry\u2019s labor costs are, as a percentage of net sales, higher than many other industries\u2019 labor costs, even if we are able to successfully renegotiate CBAs and avoid work stoppages, we may be significantly impacted by labor cost increases. Labor shortages, low levels of unemployment or decreasing workforce availability in the United States, and resulting wage inflation and/or increased overtime, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, labor is a significant cost of many of our customers in the U.S. food away from home industry. Any increase in their labor costs, including any increases in costs as a result of wage inflation, increases in minimum wage requirements or labor shortages resulting in increased overtime, could reduce the profitability of our customers and reduce their demand for our products.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain a qualified and diverse workforce.\nAlthough we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed tightening and increased competitiveness in the labor market. A labor shortage or increased employee turnover, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other general macroeconomic factors, could potentially increase labor costs, reduce our profitability and/or decrease our ability to effectively serve customers. If a material number of our employees are unable to work or terminate their employment, or become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business operations may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Recruiting and retention efforts (particularly with respect to driver and warehouse personnel) and actions to increase productivity may not be successful, and we could encounter a shortage of qualified employee talent in the future. Shortages of, and increased competition for, qualified employees may result in increased labor costs. Additionally, productivity may be negatively impacted by labor shortages or high employee turnover. Any prolonged labor shortage or period of high employee turnover could adversely affect our business operations.\nFurthermore, as a government contractor, we are subject to oversight by the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which reviews our employment practices including affirmative action and non-discrimination based on race, sex and disability, among other characteristics. If an audit or investigation reveals a failure to comply with regulations, we could become subject to civil or criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, including government pre-approval of our government contracting activities, termination of government contracts, and suspension or debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government and could also be subject to claims for breach of contract by our customers. Any of these actions could increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as a reliable government supplier.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property, Technology and Information Security\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, to be a valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCompeting intellectual property claims that impact our brands may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on technology, and we may experience a disruption in existing technology or delay in effectively implementing new technology.\nOur ability to control costs and maximize profits, as well as to serve customers most effectively, depends on the reliability of our information technology systems and related data entry processes in our transaction intensive business. We rely on software and other information technology to manage significant aspects of our business, such as purchasing, order processing, warehouse/inventory management, truck loading and logistics and optimization of storage space. We also rely on access to those systems online including through mobile devices to connect with our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. The importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees, and the employees of our customers, suppliers and business partners, working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny disruption to this information technology could negatively affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business, impair operations and profits and result in increased costs. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems, we could experience service disruptions or other system failures and our business or financial results could be adversely impacted. We have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.\nInformation technology evolves rapidly. To compete effectively, we are required to integrate new technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner. If competitors implement new technologies before we do, allowing them to provide lower priced or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA cybersecurity incident may negatively affect our operations, business, financial condition and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are outsourced to and managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to manage our data, communications and business processes, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. Our reliance on such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees, and the employees of our customers, suppliers and business partners, working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of these networks and systems gives rise to cybersecurity risks, and the risk of other security breaches (including access to or acquisition of supplier, customer, employee or other confidential information).\nThe theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of secured data or interference with the networks and systems on which we rely could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability, and competitive disadvantage, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have implemented measures such as implementing cybersecurity policies, training our employee and monitoring our information technology systems, to prevent security breaches, disruptions or other system failures, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The cost to remediate damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyberattack or other unauthorized access to secured data could be significant.\nCyberattacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent rate and are rapidly and continually evolving, making them more difficult to detect and protect against. While cyber-attackers have threatened and attempt to breach our security and access the information stored in our information systems, no incident has been material or had a material impact on our business or financial condition. There is a risk that we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents. Although we maintain insurance that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain cyber incidents, it may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nIn addition, in the event our suppliers or customers experience a breach or system failure, cyberattack or other security breach, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in our supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions\nWe may fail to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or effectively integrate the businesses we acquire.\nHistorically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. In September 2019, we completed the acquisition of the Food Group, which significantly expanded the Company\u2019s network in the West and Northwest parts of the U.S. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of Smart Foodservice, which significantly expanded the Company\u2019s cash and carry business in the West and Northwest parts of the U.S.\nIf we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated synergies in a timely manner, we may not realize our projected return on investment and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Integrating acquired businesses may be more difficult in a region or market where we have limited expertise or with a company culture or operating structure different than ours. A significant acquisition, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our leadership\u2019s attention and our administrative and operational resources. We also may be unable to retain qualified management and other key personnel of the acquired businesses, that may be necessary to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated synergies in a timely manner.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nAs a result of its Series A Preferred Stock investment, KKR owns a substantial portion of our equity and its interests may not be aligned with yours.\nOn May 6, 2020, KKR Fresh Aggregator L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, purchased 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), which it subsequently transferred to its affiliate, KKR Fresh Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (\u201cKKR\u201d), for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million, or $1,000 per share. As a result of its Series A Preferred Stock investment, KKR owns the equivalent of approximately 10% of our Common Stock on an as-converted basis and has the right to designate one director to our board of directors. As a result, KKR may have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters relating to the Company. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of KKR could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. For example, the existence of KKR as a significant shareholder and KKR\u2019s board designation rights may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of the Company.\nActions of activist stockholders could adversely impact our business and cause us to incur significant expenses.\nWe may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy or the interests of our other stockholders. On February 15, 2022, Sachem Head Capital Management (\u201cSachem Head\u201d) issued a press release disclosing its intent to nominate seven directors for election to the Company\u2019s ten-member Board of Directors at the Company\u2019s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. The Company\u2019s response to suggested actions, proposals, director nominations and/or contests for the election of directors from Sachem Head or other activist stockholders could disrupt our business and operations, divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees and be costly and time-consuming. Potential actions by Sachem Head or other activist stockholders may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans; create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy; cause uncertainty with our regulators; make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel; and adversely affect our relationships with our existing and potential customers, suppliers and other business partners. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we may be required to incur significant fees and expenses related to responding to stockholder activism, including for third-party advisors. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax disputes may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations or tax rulings may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The U.S. and many state and local jurisdictions where we do business from time to time enact changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. Given the unpredictability of possible changes to U.S. federal and state and local tax laws and regulations, it is very difficult to predict their cumulative effect on our results of operations and cash flows, but new and changed laws and regulations could adversely impact our results of operations. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other state and local tax authorities and governmental bodies, for which we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome. If the ultimate determination of these examinations is that taxes are owed by us for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes a forum selection clause.\nThe Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporate Law, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to provisions of the forum selection clause.\nThe choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nAdverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are or may be involved in the normal course of our business could limit our ability to operate our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were determined adversely to us or require a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including our employees, suppliers, customers, GPOs, investors, or regulators. Any significant adverse judgments or settlements could reduce our profits and limit our ability to operate our business.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, may interrupt our business, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 businesses.\nSome of our facilities and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 facilities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme, and occasionally prolonged, weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and extreme cold. Extreme weather conditions, whether caused by global climate change or otherwise, may interrupt our operations in such areas. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions may disrupt critical infrastructure in the United States and interrupt or impede access to our customers\u2019 facilities, reduce the number of consumers who visit our customers\u2019 facilities, interrupt our suppliers\u2019 production or shipments or increase our suppliers\u2019 product costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business could be affected by large-scale terrorist acts or the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities (especially those directed against or otherwise involving the U.S.), the outbreak of food-borne illnesses, the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the occurrence of other catastrophic events. Any of these events could impair our ability to manage our business and/or cause disruption of economic activity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur retirement benefits may give rise to significant expenses and liabilities in the future.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These pension and postretirement obligations give rise to costs that are dependent on various assumptions, including those discussed in Note 18, Retirement Plans, in our consolidated financial statements, many of which are outside of our control, such as performance of financial markets, interest rates, participant age and mortality. In the event we determine that our assumptions should be revised, our future pension and postretirement plan benefit costs could increase or decrease. The assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement obligations and related costs and funding requirements.\nIn addition to the plans we sponsor, we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. In the event that we withdraw from participating in one of these plans-including by deciding to discontinue participation in a plan in the ordinary course renegotiation of a CBA or by reducing the number of employees participating in a plan to a certain degree over a certain period of time as a result of a facility closure or other change in our operations-then applicable law could require us to make additional withdrawal liability payments to the plan based on the applicable plan\u2019s funding status. Some multiemployer plans, including ones to which we contribute, are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities, which could increase the size of potential withdrawal liability. Any withdrawal liability payments that we are required to make could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16084, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "USFD"}
