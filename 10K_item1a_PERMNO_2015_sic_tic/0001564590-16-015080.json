{"cik": "1619917", "company": "Patriot National, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nBecause we have a limited operating history as a stand-alone, combined company and business, our historical financial condition and results of operations are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone, combined, publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe activities comprising our business were historically conducted through various entities under common control with, or as part of the operations of, Guarantee Insurance and its other affiliates, and our business has only been consolidated under Patriot National and separated from the insurance risk taking operations of Guarantee Insurance Group since November 2013. In addition, we have only completed the GUI Acquisition and the Patriot Care Management Acquisition as of August 2014. As a result, our history as a stand-alone entity is limited. Our historical financial condition and results of operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not reflect what our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a stand-alone, combined, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or what our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future when we are such a company. As a result, you have limited information on which to evaluate our business. This is primarily because:\n\u25cf\nMost of our operations were separated from Guarantee Insurance and consolidated under Patriot National, Inc. in the Reorganization in November 2013, and on August 6, 2014 we acquired through the GUI Acquisition contracts to provide marketing, underwriting and policyholder services and through the Patriot Care Management Acquisition a business that provides nurse case management and bill review services.\n\u25cf\nSince our initial public offering in January 2015, our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed significantly from our historical capital structure and sources of liquidity prior to the initial public offering presented in our historical consolidated financial statements prior to 2015.\n\u25cf\nWe may incur increased costs and other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, tax status and business operations as a result of our operating as a stand-alone, combined, publicly-traded company.\nOur limited operating history as a stand-alone, combined company and business may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Any assessment of our profitability or prediction about our future success or viability is subject to significant uncertainty as we may not be able to successfully implement the changes necessary to operate as a stand-alone,\ncombined, publicly-traded company, and we may need to incur more costs, including additional legal, accounting, compliance and other expenses not reflected in our historical results, than anticipated.\nOur business may be materially adversely impacted by general economic and labor market conditions.\nWe derive our revenue from the provision of services to the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry. Given the concentration of our business activities in this industry, we may be particularly exposed to certain economic downturns or other events that impact the labor market. Because a significant portion of the fees that we receive are based on a percentage of the reference premiums written for policies we produce and service, premium levels directly impact our revenues. Premium level growth is dependent in part upon payroll growth, which, in turn, is affected by underlying economic and labor market conditions. A poor economic environment and labor market could result in decreases in demand for our workers\u2019 compensation insurance services as employers hire fewer workers, reduce wages or limit wage increases or curtail operations due to challenging market conditions. General business and economic conditions that could affect us, our carrier partners and our other clients include fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, the availability and cost of credit, and investor and consumer confidence. In addition to the adverse effects caused by a weak labor market on demand for workers\u2019 compensation insurance and related services, our carrier partners may experience increased losses in weak economic conditions because, among other things, it is more difficult to return injured workers to work when employers are otherwise reducing payrolls. This could cause them to reduce their business levels, which would in turn reduce the level of services we provide for them. In addition, some of our clients may cease offering workers\u2019 compensation products, or cease operations completely, in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, or be acquired by other companies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry is cyclical in nature, which may affect our overall financial performance.\nHistorically, the workers\u2019 compensation insurance market has witnessed cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity (known as a \u201csoft market\u201d), followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity (known as a \u201chard market\u201d). Because this cyclicality is due in large part to general economic factors and other events beyond our control, we cannot predict with certainty the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle.\nAs a provider of services to the workers\u2019 compensation insurance market, our business is likely to be impacted by this cyclical market pattern, although it is difficult to predict, overall, the exact nature and extent of such impact. For example, in a soft market, our agency and other service fees that are based on a percentage of reference premiums written could decline, although demand for our cost containment and other services could increase as insurers seek to decrease expenses and additional insurers enter the market, which increases our potential client base. In a hard market, our service fees that are based on a percentage of reference premiums written could increase, although we could experience less demand for cost containment services. Moreover, in a hard market, insurance companies typically become more selective in the workers\u2019 compensation risks they underwrite and insurance premiums increase. This often results in a reduction in industry-wide claims volumes, which could reduce demand for our claims administration, cost containment and other related services. If we are unable to accurately predict or react to any such market conditions, or if severe or unusual market conditions impact us in an unforeseen manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater recourse to self-insurance, reinsurance captive entities, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While historically we have been able to participate in reinsurance captive entities solutions on behalf of our clients and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so or that we will adequately adapt to new trends in this area, or that any potential increase in revenues from such activities would compensate for losses in our other primary businesses.\nWe may be more vulnerable to negative developments in the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry than companies that also provide outsourced services for other lines of insurance.\nOur business involves providing outsourcing services within the workers\u2019 compensation marketplace for insurance companies and other clients, and we currently do not have plans to focus our efforts on other lines of insurance. As a result, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry could have a greater adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations than on more diversified companies that also provide outsourced services for other lines of insurance.\nIf workers\u2019 compensation claims decline, in frequency or severity, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe frequency of workers\u2019 compensation claims has been declining over the past few decades, but the severity of claims, in terms of both indemnity payment costs and medical costs, has generally increased. If, as a result of market conditions, regulatory changes or other factors, claims frequency declines more than anticipated, or if claims severity declines, our business could be adversely impacted. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could lead to fewer workers on a national level and could lead to fewer work-\nrelated injuries. Technological innovations and changes in the character of the U.S. labor market over time could also lead to fewer work-related injuries and thus fewer workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nIn addition, the impact of changes in the healthcare industry, as a result of the PPACA or otherwise, is uncertain, but could include impacts on frequency (for example, by increasing healthcare insurance coverage or the prevalence of preventative treatment) and severity (by impacting the medical costs associated with claims) of workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nIf declines in the frequency or the severity of workers\u2019 compensation claims occur and persist in states where we conduct significant business, it could result in lower premium rates, which would reduce the fees that we generate as a percentage of reference premiums written, and lower claims management costs for insurers and employers, which could reduce demand for our claims administration, cost containment and other services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur total fee income and fee income from related party are currently substantially dependent on our relationships with Guarantee Insurance and a small number of other insurance carrier clients.\nA substantial portion of our total fee income and fee income from related party is generated by providing brokerage and policyholder and claims administration services to Guarantee Insurance. A portion of the fees that we receive from Guarantee Insurance pursuant to our agreements are for Guarantee Insurance\u2019s account (which we recognize as \u201cfee income from related party\u201d) and a portion of the fees are for the account of reinsurance captive entities to which Guarantee Insurance has ceded a portion of its written risk (which we recognize as \u201cfee income\u201d). See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Principal Components of Financial Statements-Revenue.\u201d As a result, a substantial portion of fee income we recognize from non-related parties is nevertheless derived from our relationship with Guarantee Insurance. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an aggregate of $209.8 million in total fee income and fee income from related party pursuant to contracts with Guarantee Insurance, and our fee income from related party was $86.9 million. Our total fee income and fee income from related party pursuant to contracts with Guarantee Insurance and our fee income from related party constituted 69% and 41%, respectively, of our total fee income and fee income from related party for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlthough we intend to expand our relationships with additional carrier partners and our service offerings to third-party clients, we expect we will continue to be significantly impacted by the overall business levels of Guarantee Insurance, Zurich, AIG and Scottsdale. While we have a limited ability to affect their business levels through the services we provide, their business levels are largely impacted by many factors outside of our control. For example, the general effects of economic and labor market conditions on business levels, a variety of market or regulatory factors can impact our carrier partners\u2019 decisions regarding the markets they enter, the products they offer and the industries they target. In addition, their business levels will depend on their ability to attract and retain policyholders, which can be impacted by their competitiveness in terms of financial strength, ratings, reputation, pricing, product offerings (including alternative market offerings) and other factors that independent retail agencies and policyholders consider attractive. A reduction in the business levels of our carrier partners would result in a reduction of the services we provide to them and the amount of revenues we generate from such services, which, assuming we have not expanded our relationships with additional carrier partners or other clients, could represent a significant portion of our revenues. Further, if the premium rates assessed by our carrier partners decreased, we would experience a corresponding decrease in the revenues that we derive from these carrier partners because a significant portion of the fee revenue we receive from providing services to them is based on a percentage of reference premiums written for the policies that we produce and service. We do not have any ability to control such rates, and in certain states premium rates are established by regulation. Further, our insurance carrier clients may in the future seek to reduce the service fees paid to us.\nOur carrier partners also have the ability to terminate their agreements with us under certain circumstances, as described in more detail under \u201cBusiness-Clients\u201d. In addition, some of our clients may cease offering workers\u2019 compensation products, or cease operations completely. For example, in March 2012 we were forced to terminate our program administrator agreement with Ullico, one of our insurance carrier clients, and to commence a process to wind-down our program under this agreement. The basis for termination, pursuant to the agreement, was the sudden and substantial deterioration of Ullico\u2019s financial position and results of operations\nIn the event our carrier partners terminate their agreements with us, our clients cease offering workers\u2019 compensation products, our clients cease operations completely, or under certain other circumstances, we could experience a significant decrease in revenue. Under such circumstances, we would attempt to replace that relationship and transition the business to another carrier partner. However, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so successfully or at all.\nFurther, we are subject to counterparty credit risk due to our dependence on a small number of insurance carrier clients. Although we monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk, if any of these clients ceases doing business or fails to perform its obligations under our contracts with them, our business, financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nFor more information about Guarantee Insurance, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence-Relationship and Transactions with Guarantee Insurance Group and Guarantee Insurance.\u201d\nOur relationship with Guarantee Insurance may create conflicts of interest, and we cannot be certain that all our transactions with Guarantee Insurance will be conducted on the same terms as those available from unaffiliated third parties.\nAs of March 14, 2016, Mr. Mariano, our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 53.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and substantially all of the outstanding equity of Guarantee Insurance Group, the parent company of Guarantee Insurance. As such, we cannot assure you all of our transactions with Guarantee Insurance will be on the same terms as those available with unaffiliated third parties or that the affiliation will not otherwise impact our actions in a manner that is adverse to us or our stockholders. Although most of our operations were separated from Guarantee Insurance and consolidated under Patriot National, Inc. in the Reorganization in November 2013, a substantial portion of our revenues is generated through our relationship with Guarantee Insurance. Our total fee income and fee income from related party pursuant to contracts with Guarantee Insurance and our fee income from related party constituted 69% and 41%, respectively, of our total fee income and fee income from related party for the year ended December 31, 2015. Furthermore, through the 2014 Acquisitions, we acquired contracts to provide marketing, underwriting and policyholder services and our Patriot Care Management Business from entities controlled by Mr. Mariano. Concurrently, we also entered into a new agreement with Guarantee Insurance to provide all such services that GUI had provided to Guarantee Insurance, its parent, prior to the GUI Acquisition.\nAlthough Mr. Mariano is no longer a board member or officer of Guarantee Insurance Group or Guarantee Insurance, and we have implemented a related party transaction policy in connection with this offering, because of his ownership position in Guarantee Insurance Group, Mr. Mariano\u2019s interests in our dealings with Guarantee Insurance may not align with our other stockholders. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence.\u201d\nWe have acquired 17 insurance and other services firms in a short period of time and we have limited experience integrating the operations of companies or businesses that we have acquired and may incur substantial costs in connection therewith which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nWe have acquired 17 insurance and other services firms in a short period of time. We believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions would likely result in slower growth. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to fully realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions. Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also suffer if we expand the number or size of our acquisitions. Furthermore, in order to achieve the growth we seek, we may acquire numerous smaller market participants, which could require significant attention from management and increase risks, costs and uncertainties associated with integration.\nThe process of integrating the operations of an acquired company may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The key areas where we may face risks and uncertainties include:\n\u00b7\nthe need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of ongoing business, diversion of resources and of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisitions and integration challenges;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions by successfully marketing the service offerings of acquired businesses to our existing partners and clients, or by successfully marketing our existing service offerings to clients and partners of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nthe negative impact of acquisitions on our results of operations as a result of large one-time charges, substantial debt or liabilities acquired or incurred, amortization or write down of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u00b7\nthe need to ensure that we comply with all regulatory requirements in connection with and following the completion of acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nretaining employees and clients and otherwise preserving the value of the assets of the businesses we acquire; and\n\u00b7\nthe need to integrate each acquired business\u2019s accounting, information technology, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management.\nPost-acquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel, retention of clients, entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business, assumption of unexpected or unknown contingencies or liabilities, risks relating to ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, tax and accounting issues, distractions to management and personnel from our existing business and integration difficulties relating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. Post-acquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges.\nIf we fail to grow our business organically we may be unable to execute our business plan or adequately address competitive challenges.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to diversify our business by entering into relationships with additional insurance carrier and other clients. As a result, we are subject to certain growth-related risks, including the risk that we will be unable to retain\npersonnel or acquire other resources necessary to service such growth adequately. While we have recently engaged in relationships with additional insurance carrier and other clients, we cannot be certain that these relationships will be successful in generating revenue or that we will be successful in establishing relationships with other potential insurance carrier and other clients that we identify in the future. In addition, the integration and management of new client relationships may divert management time and focus from operating our current businesses, and the development of the technology and other infrastructure necessary to service or facilitate new relationships could require substantial effort and expense.\nIf we cannot sustain our relationships with independent retail agencies, we may be unable to operate profitably.\nWe market and sell the insurance products of our carrier partners primarily through direct contracts with over 3,000 independent, non-exclusive retail agencies, some of which account for a large portion of our revenues. Other insurance companies and insurance service companies compete with us for the services and allegiance of these agencies. These agencies may choose to direct business to our competitors, or may direct less desirable business to us. Our business relationships with these agencies are generally governed by our standard form agreements with them that typically provide that the agreement may be terminated on 30 days\u2019 notice by either party without cause. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no agency accounted for more than 5% of our total premiums written.\nAs a result, our continued profitability depends, in part, on the marketing efforts of our independent agencies and on our ability to offer workers\u2019 compensation insurance products through our carrier partners that meet the requirements and preferences of our independent retail agencies and their clients. A significant decrease in business from, or the entire loss of, our largest agencies or several of our other large agencies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the healthcare industry could adversely impact our performance.\nOur Patriot Care Management Business acquired in 2014 provides healthcare cost containment services in connection with workers\u2019 compensation claims, including bill review and telephonic nurse case management, and through our subsidiary CWI, we provide benefits administration for clients with self-funded health and welfare plans nationwide. As a result of the PPACA and other regulatory and industry initiatives, the healthcare industry has been evolving rapidly in recent years and is expected to continue to do so. Substantially all of the key provisions of the PPACA are now effective. While federal agencies have published interim and final regulations with respect to certain requirements, many issues remain uncertain. It is difficult to predict the impact of the PPACA on our business due to the law\u2019s complexity, the political environment, the continuing development of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, legal challenges and possible future legislative changes. We are unable to predict how these events will develop and what impact they will have on the PPACA, and in turn, on our business including, but not limited to, our relationships with current and future clients, as well as our products, services, processes and technology.\nIt is possible that such changes in the healthcare industry could result in reduced demand for, or effectiveness of, our healthcare cost containment services. For example, if the PPACA is successful in increasing healthcare coverage, improving wellness and/or slowing the growth rate of, or even reducing healthcare costs, it could decrease the frequency and severity of workers\u2019 compensation claims. Alternatively, if an increase in the availability of healthcare insurance coverage resulted in demand for healthcare services outpacing available supply, it could make it more difficult for us to contain healthcare costs. In addition, healthcare providers have become more active in their efforts to minimize the use of certain cost containment techniques by insurers and are engaging in litigation to avoid application of certain cost containment practices. Recent litigation between healthcare providers and insurers has challenged certain insurers\u2019 claims adjudication and reimbursement decisions. Although these lawsuits do not directly involve us or any services we provide, these cases may affect the use by insurers of certain cost containment services that we provide and may result in a decrease in revenue from our cost containment business. If we are unable to adapt to healthcare market changes with our existing services or by developing and providing new services, our business would be adversely affected.\nFurther, the PPACA provides various incentives that affect demand for our services. For example, under the PPACA\u2019s employer shared responsibility, or \u201cplay or pay,\u201d provisions, employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees must offer health insurance to certain of their employees and their dependent children, and if coverage meeting certain minimum requirements is not offered the employer may face non-deductible tax penalties. Although employers retain the choice between fully underwritten and self-insured health insurance plans to comply with these requirements, the PPACA creates significant mandate and cost differences between fully underwritten and self-insured plans by exempting self-insured plans from certain requirements that can result in increased costs for fully underwritten plans, such as single risk pool standards and medical loss ratio mandates. Accordingly, these provisions encourage demand for the administration services we offer for self-insured plans. Any changes to the PPACA and its implementing regulations and guidance, including as a result of legal and legislative challenges, that lower the requirements for employers to provide health insurance or that make self-insured plans less attractive could result in reduced demand for our healthcare administration services, and our business could be adversely affected as a result.\nOur geographic concentration ties our performance to business, economic and regulatory conditions in certain states, and unfavorable conditions in these states could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, a majority of our reference premiums written is concentrated in Florida, California, New Jersey, Georgia, New York and Pennsylvania, with Florida and California being the largest contributors.\nOur workers\u2019 compensation insurance service operations could be particularly adversely affected by an economic downturn in one or more of these states. In addition to the various other factors that could impact the economic and labor market conditions in these states, conditions could be affected by local or regional events, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, or other catastrophic events that disrupt the local economy and cause businesses to cease operations or decrease payroll, thus reducing demand for workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\nWe could also be adversely affected by any material change in law, regulation or any court decision affecting the workers\u2019 compensation insurance industry generally in these states. For example, in Florida and New Jersey where a significant portion of the policies that we service are written, insurance regulators establish the premium rates charged by our carrier partners. If insurance regulators in these states decrease premium rates or prevent them from increasing, it would directly adversely impact our fees that are based on a percentage of reference premiums written. In addition, if regulators set rates below those that our carrier partners require to maintain profitability, our carrier partners may be less willing to write policies in those states or attempt to negotiate lower fees from us, which would adversely impact the revenues we generate through our relationships with our carrier partners.\nAny of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and our failure to comply with such regulation or adapt to new regulatory and legislative initiatives may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the insurance regulatory agencies of the states in which we are licensed and, to a lesser extent, federal regulation. For example, approximately half of the states in the United States have enacted laws that require licensing of businesses which provide medical review services such as ours. Some of these laws apply to medical review of care covered by workers\u2019 compensation. These laws typically establish minimum standards for qualifications of personnel, confidentiality, internal quality control and dispute resolution procedures. We are also subject to state insurance fraud provisions, as well as federal fraud-and-abuse, anti-kickback and false claims statutes. Such laws, regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs or by restricting the products or services we may sell, the markets we may enter, the methods by which we may sell products and services, the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our carrier partners and other clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulation may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses, censures, redress to clients and fines.\nLicensing laws and regulations vary from state to state, but in general many of the services that we provide require licensing. For example, our policyholder services and claims administration activities generally require licensing at the state level. In all states, the applicable licensing laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad and general discretion as to the granting, renewing and revoking of licenses and approvals. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including the violation of regulations and conviction of crimes. Possible sanctions which may be imposed by regulatory authorities include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for specified periods of time, revocation of licenses, censures, redress to clients and fines.\nFurther, state insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, and such re-examination may result in the enactment of insurance-related laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations thereof, that adversely affect our business. In some instances, we follow practices based on interpretations of laws and regulations generally followed by the industry, which may prove to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, we offer reinsurance captive entity design and management services, and expect to be able to continue offering such services. The NAIC has established a subgroup to study the use of reinsurance captive entities and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk in relation to existing state laws and regulations. Any action by federal, state or other regulators that adversely affects our ability to offer services in relation to reinsurance captive entities, either retroactively or prospectively, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest. Adverse regulatory developments regarding the forms of compensation we can receive (for example, contingent commissions), could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to compliance challenges posed by the regulatory environment in which we operate, regulatory changes could also affect the fundamentals of our business if they reduced demand for our services. For example, any change to workers\u2019 compensation laws or regulations that reduced demand for workers\u2019 compensation insurance or resulted in fewer or less severe workers\u2019 compensation claims could adversely impact our business and prospects.\nOur carrier partners, as insurance companies, are also heavily regulated by the states in which they operate, as well as by the federal government for participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. They are subject to regulations regarding, among other things, solvency, capital levels, loss reserves, investments, pricing, and affiliate transactions. Although we are not subject to regulation as an insurance company, pursuant to our agreements with our insurance carrier clients, we\nassume liability for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory bulletins regarding the reporting of policy data for our clients. We are liable for payments or reimbursements in connection with any fines or penalties imposed on our clients arising out of services we perform for them under the agreements, and we would be required participate fully with our clients in any action plan or other corrective measures required by any regulatory agency or body, which could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. In addition, we could also be indirectly impacted by regulatory changes that affect our carrier partners if they cause them to terminate or alter their relationships with us.\nOur carrier partners can also be impacted by federal legislation. For example, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (\u201cTRIA\u201d), which provides a federal backstop insurance program for acts of terrorism, is scheduled to expire at the end of 2020. Because workers\u2019 compensation carriers are not able to exclude acts of terrorism from the coverage they offer, if the TRIA is not extended beyond 2020, its expiration could lead to reduced capacity of private insurers if they are unable to sufficiently increase premium rates or are otherwise unwilling to take on the additional risk. Should the TRIA expire and our carrier partners decrease their business levels in certain markets where we provide services for them, it could decrease the revenues we generate in those markets. We are unable to predict whether the TRIA will be extended beyond 2020 or whether any such extension would include changes to the TRIA that would negatively impact our carrier partners.\nIn addition, we are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the collection, use, transmission, security and privacy of personal and business information that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the provision of our services. For example, in providing our healthcare services we are required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), which sets forth health information security breach notification requirements and increased penalties for violation of HIPAA, and our pre-employment screening services are subject to laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and various state laws governing when an applicant\u2019s criminal history may be considered in making hiring decisions. These laws continue to develop, the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase, and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The future enactment of more restrictive privacy and data protection laws, rules or regulations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses. In addition, despite the measures that we have in place to ensure compliance with these privacy and data protection laws, these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices, and our facilities and systems, and those of our insurance carrier clients and other clients, are vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors or other similar events. Enforcement actions for violation of the applicable privacy and data protection laws against us could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may adversely affect our business. While we have not received any notices of any such violation and believe we are in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such notices in the future.\nWe are unable to predict what additional government initiatives, if any, affecting our business may be promulgated in the future. Proposals for healthcare legislative reforms are regularly considered at the federal and state levels. To the extent that such proposals affect workers\u2019 compensation, such proposals may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business may be adversely affected by failure to comply with existing laws and regulations, failure to obtain necessary licenses and government approvals or failure to adapt to new or modified regulatory requirements. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation.\u201d\nOur and intangible assets could become impaired, which could lead to material non-cash charges against earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $118.1 million of goodwill and approximately $75.7 million of net intangible assets (the latter, net of $11.5 million of accumulated amortization and generating a deferred tax liability of approximately $9.1 million) recorded, which represents, in the aggregate, 63% of our total assets. This goodwill and intangible assets are primarily associated with the Acquisitions. We assess potential impairment on our goodwill and intangible asset balances, including client lists, on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is any indication that the asset may be impaired. Any impairment of goodwill or intangible assets resulting from this periodic assessment would result in a non-cash charge against current earnings, which could lead to a material impact on our results of operations, statements of financial position, and earnings per share. Any decline in future revenues, cash flows or growth rates as a result of further adverse changes in the economic environment, the failure of any acquired business to perform in accordance with our expectations or an adverse change resulting from new governmental regulations or other factors could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable debt and divert our cash flow from operations to make debt payments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was approximately $126.8 million. The credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\npay dividends and make capital expenditures if we do not repay amounts drawn under our credit facility or if there is another default under our credit facility;\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness, including the issuance of guarantees;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all our assets to, another person; or\n\u00b7\nenter into a new line of business.\nIn addition, all obligations under the senior secured credit facility are guaranteed by all of our existing and future subsidiaries other than foreign subsidiaries and secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 tangible and intangible assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, including a pledge of 100% of the stock of each guarantor.\nFurther, our substantial indebtedness may require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations toward debt service, reducing the availability of funds for other purposes, and make us vulnerable to interest rate increases because all of our indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility bears interest at a variable rate.\nOur credit facility further requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial covenants. These financial ratios and covenants could include requirements that we maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nTherefore, we may need to seek permission from our lenders in order to engage in some corporate actions or obtain additional financing. Our lenders\u2019 interests may be different from ours and we may not be able to obtain our lenders\u2019 permission when needed. This may limit our ability to pay dividends to you if we determine to do so in the future, to finance our future operations or capital requirements, to make acquisitions or to pursue business opportunities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources- Indebtedness-Senior Secured Credit Facility.\u201d\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. Our failure to make the required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness would result in an event of default under the agreement governing such indebtedness, which may result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and others may have greater financial resources to compete effectively.\nThe market for workers\u2019 compensation insurance services is highly competitive. Competition in our business is based on many factors. In competing to offer our services to insurance carriers, we compete based on pricing, quality and scope of available services, underwriting practices, reputation and reliability, ability to reduce claims expenses, customer service and general experience. In competing to place business on behalf of our carrier partners, competition is also based on the product offerings, premium pricing and financial strength, ratings and reputation of our carrier partners. In some cases, our competitors may offer lower priced products or services than we do. If our competitors offer more competitive prices, payment plans, services or commissions to independent retail agencies, we could lose our market share or have to reduce our prices in order to maintain our market share, which would adversely affect our profitability. If we are unable to reduce claims expenses for our carrier partners or otherwise demonstrate the value of our services to our partners and clients, we could lose our market share or be forced to offer lower priced services to maintain our market share. Our competitors are national and regional insurance companies that provide services similar to ours through in-house capabilities or separate divisions, and other workers\u2019 compensation insurance agencies and service providers, many of which are significantly larger and possess considerably greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result of this scale, they may be able to capitalize on lower expenses to offer more competitive pricing.\nIn policyholder services, we believe we compete with numerous national wholesale agents and brokers, as well as insurance companies that sell directly to clients. In claims administration services, we compete with numerous businesses of varying sizes that offer claims management, cost containment, and/or other services that are similar to those that we offer. With respect to our insurance carrier clients in particular, we also compete with insurance companies that service their policies in-house rather than outsourcing to a\nprovider like us. In all of the services we provide, we also compete with numerous smaller market participants that may operate in a particular geographic area or segment of the market, or offer only a particular service.\nMany of our competitors are multi-line carriers that can provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance and related services at a loss in order to obtain other lines of business at a profit. While we believe our outsourcing services could offer an attractive alternative to such multi-line carriers, it may be difficult for us and our carrier partners to compete with such carriers if they continue to service their policies in-house at a loss. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe compete on the basis of the quality of our outcome-driven service model, and our failure to continue to perform at high levels could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our ability to deliver demonstrable value and help our clients generate cost savings through our proprietary SWARM process and other cost containment services is a key competitive advantage. As we grow, whether organically or through acquisitions, we may expand into different geographic regions or service policies in different industries and risk classes. We will also need to adapt to regulatory and technological changes over time. If we are unable to adapt our processes and services as necessary to maintain our historical performance levels in terms of claims processing and closure rates as a result of this growth and change, it could adversely affect our client relationships and ability to earn and retain business.\nOur business is dependent on the efforts of our senior management and other key employees who leverage their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets and services and relationships with independent retail agencies that sell the insurance products of our carrier partners.\nWe believe our success will depend in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business and strategy. We rely substantially on the services of our executive management team and other key employees, including Mr. Mariano, our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we are not aware of any planned departures or retirements of any member of our senior management team, if we were to lose the services of one or more such members, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly-qualified personnel to operate our claims management and cost containment services. We believe that our ability to deliver a high-quality and cost-effective claims management solution through our proprietary SWARM process is a key competitive advantage, and experienced and knowledgeable managers and personnel are an important component of this process. If we are unable to attract and retain such managers and personnel on satisfactory terms, especially as we grow our business, our performance and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are reliant on our information processing systems and any failure or inadequate performance of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on information systems to provide effective and efficient service to our carrier partners and other clients, process claims, and timely and accurately report results to carriers. In particular, our IE system plays a pivotal role in all aspects of the services we provide, which can range from the issuance of new policies on behalf of carrier partners, to the administration and adjudication of claims. However, an interruption of our access to, or failure in the performance of, our IE system or our other information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform essential services on a timely basis. If sustained or repeated, such an interruption or failure could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, manage and investigate claims in a timely and cost-effective manner or perform other necessary business functions. Any of the foregoing could result in a loss of confidence by our carrier partners or otherwise adversely affect our relationships with them. In addition, we expect that a considerable amount of our future growth will depend on our ability to process and manage claims data more efficiently and to provide more meaningful healthcare information to clients and payors of healthcare services and expenses. If we experience such interruptions or failures, or if the IE system does not provide the benefits we anticipate or support our future growth, we could be required to invest significant funds in the upgrade, modification or repair of the system.\nInterruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data, breakdown or malfunctioning of computer equipment and software systems, telecommunications failure, or damage caused by fire, tornadoes, lightning, electrical power outage, or other disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, we cannot be sure that insurance or these services will continue to be available, cover all our losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide business services.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our clients, independent retail agencies or vendors could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe manage a large amount of highly sensitive and confidential consumer information including personally identifiable information, protected health information and financial information, and are subject to regulatory requirements regarding data\nsecurity. Our systems, including our IE system, like others in the insurance services industry, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, and we are subject to potential disruption caused by cyber-attacks on our systems. Such attacks may have various goals, from seeking confidential information to causing operational disruption. Although to date such activities have not resulted in material disruptions to our operations or, to our knowledge, breach of any security or confidential information, and we have taken, and continue to take, actions to protect the security and privacy of our information, no assurance can be provided that such disruptions or breach will not occur in the future. In addition, in the event that new data security laws are implemented, or our carrier partners or other clients determine to impose new requirements on us relating to data security, we may not be able to timely comply with such requirements, or such requirements may not be compatible with the current processes employed by our IE system. Any significant violations of data privacy and failure to timely implement required changes could result in the loss of business, litigation, regulatory investigations, penalties or negative publicity that could damage our reputation with existing or potential carrier partners and clients and adversely affect our business.\nIf we infringe on the proprietary rights of others, our business operations may be disrupted, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights. Any such claim, with or without merit, could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. To the extent that we violate a patent or other intellectual property right of a third party, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned, and we may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, to use the right or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish our objectives. The cost of such activity could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are, and may become, party to lawsuits or other claims that could adversely impact our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are named as a defendant in suits by insureds or claimants contesting decisions by us or our clients with respect to the settlement of claims. There can be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed against us. There also can be no assurance that any such lawsuits will not have a disruptive impact upon the operation of our business, and that the defense of the lawsuits will not consume the time and attention of our senior management and financial resources or that the resolution of any such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer owns a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock and will be able to influence stockholder and management decisions, which may conflict with your interests as a stockholder.\nAs of March 14, 2016, Mr. Mariano, our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owned 53.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of his ownership position, Mr. Mariano may have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including, without limitation, the election or removal of directors, mergers, acquisitions, changes of control of our company and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, because he is also our Chief Executive Officer, he has significant influence in our management and affairs. This control may delay, deter or prevent acts that may be favored by our other stockholders, as the interests of Mr. Mariano may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders. In particular Mr. Mariano owns substantially all of the outstanding equity of Guarantee Insurance Group, the parent company of Guarantee Insurance. As such, we cannot assure you all of our transactions with Guarantee Insurance will be on the same terms as those available with unaffiliated third parties or that the affiliation will not otherwise impact our actions in a manner that is adverse to us or our stockholders. Although Mr. Mariano is no longer a board member or officer of Guarantee Insurance Group or Guarantee Insurance, and we have implemented a related party transaction policy in connection with our IPO, we cannot provide assurance that he will not be influenced by his interest in Guarantee Insurance Group and seek to cause us to take courses of action that might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with a significant stockholder.\nFurthermore, as of March 14, 2016, Mr. Mariano has pledged 1,330,380 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 5.0% of our total outstanding shares, to secure obligations under a credit agreement dated as of April 11, 2013, between Mr. Mariano and UBS Bank USA. Additionally, as of March 14, 2016, Mr. Mariano has pledged 10,525,100 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 38.7 % of our total outstanding shares, to secure obligations under a loan agreement dated as of March 11, 2015, between Mr. Mariano and Fifth Third Bank, and Mr. Mariano may make additional pledges of our common stock in the future. In the event of a default by Mr. Mariano under any agreement secured by shares of our common stock, Mr. Mariano\u2019s creditors may foreclose upon any and all of the pledged shares and a change in ownership or control of us could ultimately result.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of March 14, 2016, we had a total of 27,176,441 shares of common stock outstanding. Of the outstanding shares, 18,664,494 shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except that any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 under the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates may be sold only in compliance with the volume, manner of sale and other limitations contained in Rule 144. Registration of the sale of these shares of our common stock would permit their sale into the market immediately. The market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nAs of March 14, 2016, 7,992,398 shares are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144. Under Rule 144, restricted securities may be sold in the open market subject to satisfying certain requirements including holding period, the availability of current public information about our company and, in the case of affiliates, volume limitations and manner of sale.\nWe have reserved a total of 2,824,968 shares for issuance under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of March 14, 2016, we have granted 2,218,608 shares of our common stock in connection with outstanding vested and unvested equity awards under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan and an aggregate of 606,360 of common stock were available for future issuance under such plan (which includes shares issueable upon settlement of time-vesting restricted stock units and performance vesting stock). Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by investors of our common stock. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statement are available for sale in the open market.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if certain stockholders holding registration rights exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nThere is an increased potential for short sales of our common stock due to the sales of shares issued upon exercise of warrants, which could materially affect the market price of the stock.\nDownward pressure on the market price of our common stock that likely will result from sales of our common stock issued in connection with an exercise of warrants could encourage short sales of our common stock by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security\u2019s price. As the selling stockholders exercise their warrants, we issue shares to the exercising selling stockholders, which such selling stockholders may then sell into the market. Such sales could have a tendency to depress the price of the stock, which could increase the potential for short sales.\nCertain provisions of the New Series A Warrants and New Series B Warrants provide for preferential treatment to the holders of the warrants and could impede a sale of our company.\nThe New Series A Warrants and New Series B Warrants give each holder the option to require us to redeem these warrants upon a change in control transaction by paying cash based on a Black-Scholes valuation of the warrants. In addition, upon any going-private transaction, holders are entitled to receive a cash payment that is the greater of the Black-Scholes value of the warrants and the consideration they would have received had they exercised their warrants and received shares of common stock in full immediately prior to such transaction. The method of calculating the Black-Scholes value includes the requirement to calculate the Black-Scholes value using the greater of volatility of 50% and 30 day volatility for certain trading periods. The cash payment could be greater than the consideration that our other equity holders would receive in a change in control transaction. The provisions of the New Series A Warrants and New Series B Warrants could make a change in control transaction more expensive for a potential acquirer and could negatively impact our ability to pursue and consummate such a transaction.\nBecause we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operation results, capital requirements, and contractual, regulatory and other restrictions, including restrictions contained in the senior secured credit facility or agreements governing any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur, on the payment of dividends by us or by our subsidiaries to us, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. See \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividends.\u201d\nAs a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could make us unable to fund our capital requirements.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate, or we may require additional funds to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution. Our board is authorized to issue preferred stock which could have rights and preferences senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock, diluting their interest or being subject to rights and preferences senior to their own.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade or provide negative outlook on our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade or provide negative outlook on our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our business or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected, and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important.\nThe JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following January 22, 2015, the date of our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, upon the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months and (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs, and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of being a public company, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We have also incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These rules and regulations have increased, and will increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe intend to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, which we refer to as \u201cSection 404.\u201d Our internal control over financial reporting does not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In particular, we have not yet established and adopted all of the formal policies, processes and practices related to financial reporting that will be necessary to comply with Section 404. Such policies, processes and practices are important to ensure the identification of key financial reporting risks, assessment of their potential impact and linkage of those risks to specific areas and activities within our organization. The process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the course of our testing, we may identify deficiencies, which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. So long as we are an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404.\nBased on an analysis performed in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, a material weakness was identified in connection with the incorrect classification of certain warrants outstanding as equity rather than debt. However, these warrants were reclassified as a liability in the financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, and we believe this weakness has been remediated, including through the hiring of additional staff and additional procedures as part of our financial statement close process.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions, stock exchange delisting or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients and otherwise negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue, and determine the rights, powers and preferences of, one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u00b7\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nthe removal of directors only for cause and in certain circumstances only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and\n\u00b7\nthat certain provisions may be amended in certain circumstances only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.", "PERMNO": 15164, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "PNTPQ"}
