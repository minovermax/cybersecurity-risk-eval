You should consider carefully these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. For fiscal year 2013 and 2012, we reported a net loss of $27.0 million and $90.8 million, respectively, which was primarily attributable to the impact of discontinued operations and one-time impairments. This, among other operational and working capital deficit issues, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There are no assurances that we will be able to return to profitable operations in the future or that we will not recognize additional write-offs in future periods which will adversely impact our financial results.\nOur revenues declined in fiscal year 2013 and there are no assurances they will return to historic levels.\nOur revenues from continuing operations declined 67% in fiscal year 2013 from fiscal year 2012 which was primarily attributable to declines in revenues from our Consulting segments offset by a very modest growth in revenues from our Basic Materials segment. Our ability to increase our revenues across all segments in fiscal year 2014 and beyond is dependent upon general economic growth in our markets, our ability to effectively compete and access to sufficient capital. There are no assurances we will be successful in increasing our revenues in future periods.\nWe reported losses for fiscal year 2013 and our gross profit margins are not sufficient to enable us to report profitable operations.\nOur comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders for fiscal year 2013 was $25.0 million. We reported a net loss from continuing operations of $11.7 million in fiscal year 2013, which was primarily attributable to $8.1 million loss on revaluation for receivables and payables in the form of available-for-sale marketable securities. However, our gross profit was only marginally greater than our operating expenses. In addition to an operating loss, as a result of one time charges associated with impairments and realized losses on securities we accept as partial compensation for services in our Consulting segment, we reported a loss from continuing operations of $11.7 million. Lastly, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we discontinued all magnesium operations in China and sold two subsidiaries of basic material segment at loss and reported a loss from discontinued operations of $63.0 million. While we expect that these events will improve our financial results in future periods, until such time as we are able to significantly increase our gross profit, our ability to report profitable operations could be adversely impacted.\n- 6 -\nThe metals industry is highly cyclical. Fluctuations in the pricing and availability of magnesium and in levels of customer demand have historically been severe, and future changes and/or fluctuations could cause us to experience lower sales volumes and revenues, which would negatively impact our profit margins.\nThe metals industry is highly cyclical. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions, levels of industry capacity and availability of usable raw materials. The overall levels of demand for our magnesium and magnesium-based products reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions worldwide which then impact the level of production in the PRC. For example, many of the principal uses of magnesium and magnesium-related products are for the production of structural metal, steel and aluminum manufacturing, production of alloys used in aircraft and automobile parts, the manufacture of electronic equipment such as computers, cameras, and cellular phones and the use of magnesium powder in flares, flashes and pyrotechnics. The market for these products are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, including the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction demand. These cyclical shifts in our customers\u2019 industries tend to result in significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products. As a result, in periods of recession or low economic growth, metals companies, including ours, have generally tended to under-perform compared to other industries. We generally have high fixed costs, so changes in industry demand that impact our production volume also can significantly impact our profit margins and our overall financial condition. Economic downturns in the worldwide economy or a prolonged decline in demand in our Magnesium segment has had a negative impact on our operations and a continuation or further deterioration of current economic conditions could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to implement our expansion plans, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAn important part of our strategy is to grow our business by acquiring additional production facilities for magnesium and magnesium related products. In addition, the operation of our industrial commodities business may require a significant cash investment to finance purchases of commodities we intend to sell. We will need to issue additional financing to implement our expansion strategy to acquire additional magnesium production facilities and finance the operations of our industrial commodities business. We may not have access to the funding required for these plans on acceptable terms. Our expansion plans may also suffer significant delays as a result of a variety of factors, such as legal and regulatory requirements, either of which could prevent us from completing our plans as currently expected. Our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing operations. In addition, even if we can implement our strategy, expansion in the magnesium and industrial commodities market, increased sales to various industries, including the automobile industry may not materialize to the extent we expect, or at all, resulting in unutilized magnesium production capacity and unrecoverable expenses and investments in our trading business. Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy, including for any of the above reasons, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nThe value of the equity securities we accept as compensation is subject to adjustment which could result in losses to us in future periods.\nIn our Consulting segment, historically we have accepted equity securities of our clients as compensation for services. These securities are reflected on our balance sheet as \u201cmarketable securities available-for-sale\u201d. At the end of each period, we evaluate the carrying value of the marketable securities for a decrease in value. We evaluate the company underlying these marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is judged to be \u201cother- than- temporary\u201d, the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is charged to earnings. As a result of these policies, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we recognized a one-time impairment of $12.3 million related to the carrying value of these marketable equity securities. In addition, we also recorded a one-time loss of $8.1 million as a result of significant declines in the market value of other receivable marketable securities during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Any future additional impairment would adversely affect our operating results for the corresponding periods in that we would be required to reduce the carrying value of these investments. In addition, if we are unable to liquidate these securities, we will be required to write off the investments which would adversely affect our financial position.\n- 7 -\nWe need additional financing to fund acquisitions and our operations which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms. Additional capital raising efforts in future periods may be dilutive to our then current shareholders or result in increased interest expense in future periods.\nWe may need to raise additional working capital to fund expected growth in our industrial commodities business. Our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including our operations, the financial condition of an acquisition target and its need for capital, our ability to finance our purchases of commodities with financial instruments provided by buyers, our ability to generate revenues from other sources, and our ability to manage the growth of our business and our ability to control our expenses. Also, if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution. As we will generally not be required to obtain the consent of our shareholders before entering into acquisition transactions, shareholders are dependent upon the judgment of our management in determining the number and characteristics of stock issued as consideration in an acquisition. In addition, new securities may contain certain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed in the future on terms acceptable to us, if at all, as the current capital markets have been adversely affected by the severe liquidity crisis. If we do not raise capital as needed, we will be unable to operate our business or fully implement our acquisition expansion strategy.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is, to a certain extent, attributable to the management, sales and marketing, and operational expertise of key personnel of our subsidiaries in the PRC who perform key functions in the operation of our business as well as our U.S. based management team. We do not exercise any substantive day to day supervision over the activities of key members of the PRC based management team which includes Yuwei Huang and Kong Tung. The loss of one or more of these key employees or our chief executive officer, Dr. Wang, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nAs described later in this report, our management has determined that as of September 30, 2013, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of identified significant deficiencies and material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a registrant\u2019s financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the result of our remediation of the identified significant deficiencies and material weakness is not successful, or if additional significant deficiencies are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the PRC. We can make no assurance, however, that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 8 -\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 will limit the value of securities we can accept as payment for our business consulting services which may limit our future revenues.\nWe have historically accepted securities as payment for our services and will likely continue to do so in the future, but only to the extent that it does not cause us to become classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940. To the extent that we are required to reduce the amount of securities we accept as payment for our consulting services to avoid becoming an investment company, our future revenues from our business consulting services may substantially decline if our clients cannot pay our fees in stock or securities. A reduction in the amount of our consulting fees will materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Any future change in our fee structure for our consulting services could also severely limit our ability to attract business consulting clients in the future.\nThe acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.\nA significant element of our growth strategy is to acquire controlling interests in companies that operate in the PRC and that offer services, products, technologies, industry specializations or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expect to expend significant resources to undertake business, financial and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition targets and there is no guarantee that we will acquire the company after completing due diligence. The process of identifying and consummating an acquisition could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of acquired companies. In addition, even if we are successful in acquiring additional companies, there are no assurances that the operations of these businesses will enhance our future financial condition. To the extent that a business we acquire does not meet the performance criteria used to establish a purchase price, some or all of the goodwill related to that acquisition or a write down of assets acquired could be charged against our future earnings, if any.\nRisk Related to Doing Business in South America\nSubstantially all of our mineral businesses are operated in South America and are subject to changes resulting from the political and economic policies of the governments of South American countries.\nSouth America is commonly perceived as a volatile business environment. It\u2019s futile to attempt to challenge this perception, especially since both the historical facts and anecdotal evidence from throughout the nineteenth, twentieth, and beginning of the twenty-first centuries feed this perception. Ranked as the third most unstable region in the world in the post-war era, political instability has been a pervasive problem in South America.\nOur financial performance may be negatively affected by regulatory, political, economic and social conditions in South American countries in which we have significant operations or projects. In many of these jurisdictions, we are exposed to various risks such as potential renegotiation, nullification or forced modification of existing contracts, expropriation or nationalization of property, foreign exchange controls, changes in local laws, regulations and policies, political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerilla activities and terrorism. We also face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel or having to enforce a judgment against a sovereign nation within its own territory. Actual or potential political or social changes and changes in economic policy may undermine investor confidence, which may hamper investment and thereby reduce economic growth, and otherwise may adversely affect the economic and other conditions under which we operate in ways that could have a materially negative effect on our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in government policies or trends such as resource nationalism, including the imposition of new taxes or royalties on mining activities.\nIn the South American countries where we are present, governments may impose new taxes, raise existing taxes and royalty rates, reduce tax exemptions and benefits, request or force renegotiation of tax stabilization agreements or change the basis on which taxes are calculated in a manner that is unfavorable to us. Governments that have committed to provide a stable taxation or regulatory environment may alter those commitments or shorten their duration.\nWe are also required to meet domestic beneficiation requirements in certain South American countries in which we operate, such as local processing rules, export taxes or restrictions, or charges on unprocessed ores. The imposition of or increase in such taxes or charges can significantly increase the risk profile and costs of operations in those jurisdictions. We and the mining industry are subject to rising trends of resource nationalism in certain countries in which we operate that can result in constraints on our operations, increased taxation or even expropriations and nationalizations.\n- 9 -\nDisagreements with local communities of South American countries in which we operate could adversely impact our business and reputation.\nDisputes with communities where we operate in South America may arise from time to time. Although we contribute to local communities with taxes, royalties, employment and business opportunities and social programs, expectations are complex and involve multiple stakeholders with different and constantly evolving interests. Some of our current and potential operations are located in or near communities that may regard the operation as being detrimental to their circumstances. Community expectations are typically complex with the potential for multiple inconsistent stakeholder views that may be difficult to resolve. Stakeholder opinion and community acceptance can be subject to many influences, for example, related industries, operations of other groups, local, regional or national events in other places where we operate. In the extreme, our operations may be a focus for civil unrest or criminal activity.\nDisagreements or disputes with local groups, including indigenous or aboriginal groups, could cause delays or interruptions to our operations, adversely affect our reputation or otherwise hamper our ability to develop our reserves and conduct our operations. Protesters have taken actions to disrupt our operations and projects, and they may continue to do so in the future. Although we engage in active dialogue with all stakeholders and vigorously defend ourselves against illegal acts, future attempts by protesters to harm our operations could adversely affect our business\nOur projects are subject to risks that may result in increased costs or delay in their implementation.\nWe are investing to maintain and further increase our production capacity and logistics capabilities and to expand the scope of the minerals we produce. We regularly review the economic viability of our projects. As a result of this review, we may decide to postpone, suspend or interrupt the implementation of certain projects. Our projects are also subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our growth prospects and profitability, including the following:\n1.\nOur efforts to develop projects on schedule may be hampered by a lack of infrastructure, including reliable telecommunications services and power supply.\n2.\nSuppliers and contractors may fail to meet their contractual obligations to us.\n3.\nWe may face unexpected weather conditions or other force majeure events.\n4.\nWe may fail to obtain the required permits and licenses to build a project, or we may experience delays or higher than expected costs in obtaining them.\n5.\nJoint ventures, strategic partnerships or non-managed operations may not be successful and may not comply with our standards.\n6.\nChanges in market conditions or regulations may make a project less profitable than expected at the time we initiated work on it.\n7.\nThere may be accidents or incidents during project implementation.\n8.\nWe may face shortages of skilled personnel.\n9.\nWe may encounter delays or higher than expected costs in obtaining the necessary equipment or services and in implementing new technologies to build and operate a project.\nOperational problems could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nIneffective project management and operational breakdowns might require us to suspend or curtail operations, which could generally reduce our productivity. Operational breakdowns could entail failure of critical plant and machinery. There is no assurance that ineffective project management or other operational problems will not occur. Any damages to our projects or delays in our operations caused by ineffective project management or operational breakdowns could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is subject to a number of operational risks that may adversely affect our results of operations, such as:\n\u00b7\nAdverse mining conditions delaying or hampering our ability to produce the expected quantity of minerals and to meet specifications required by customers, which can trigger price adjustments.\n\u00b7\nUnexpected weather conditions or other force majeure events.\n\u00b7\nDelays or interruptions in the transportation of our products, including with railroads, ports and ships.\n\u00b7\nLabor disputes which commonly occur in South American counties may disrupt our operations from time to time.\n\u00b7\nTropical diseases, HIV/AIDS and other contagious diseases in regions where some of our development projects are located, which pose health and safety risks to our employees.\n- 10 -\n\u00b7\nChanges in market conditions or regulations may affect the economic prospects of an operation and make it inconsistent with our business strategy.\n\u00b7\nDisruptions to or unavailability of critical information technology systems or services resulting from accidents or malicious acts.\nOur business is exposed to currency risk caused by the fluctuation in exchange rates.\nThe great majority of our sales are denominated in US dollars, which is also the currency used for holding surplus cash, financing operations, and presenting external and internal results. Although many costs are incurred in US dollars, significant costs are influenced by the local currencies of the South American countries where we operate, principally the Venezuela Bolivar, Peruvian Sol and Chilean Peso. The normal policy is to avoid hedging of foreign exchange rates, so we are vulnerable to appreciation in the value of other currencies against the US dollar, or to prolonged periods of exchange rate volatility.\nOur operations are vulnerable to a range of interruptions, not all of which are covered fully by insurance.\nOur insurance does not cover every potential loss associated with our operations and adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance provision may not fully cover its liability or the consequences of any business interruption. Our business is subject to a number of potential losses that may not be fully covered by insurance, such as:\n1. Natural disasters and events - Mining, smelting, refining and infrastructure installations are vulnerable to natural events including earthquakes, drought, flood, fire, storm and the possible effects of climate change.\n2. Sustained operational difficulties - We have various operating difficulties, ranging from unexpected geological variations that could result in significant ground or containment failure to breakdown of key capital equipment. Reliable roads, rail networks, ports, power generation and transmission, and water supplies are required to access and conduct our operations. An extended failure of critical system components or malicious actions, including a cybersecurity attack, could result in significant environmental incident, commercial loss or interruption to operations.\n3. Major operational failure - Our operations involve chemicals and other substances under high temperature and pressure, with the potential of fire, explosion or other loss of control of the process, leading to a release of hazardous materials. This could occur by accident or a breach of operating standards, and could result in a significant incident.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the last few years. Some specific factors that may have a significant effect on the future market price of our shares of common stock include:\n\u2022\nactual or expected fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of market analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions or general conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions or contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings and enforcement and legal actions;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by our shareholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in market prices for our products or for our raw materials; and\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst research and recommendations regarding the shares of our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for companies with PRC based operations in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 11 -\nAs a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares.\nIf we are required to redeem our outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, our liquidity will be adversely impacted in future periods.\nFollowing the July 2012 delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Stock Market, the holders of the shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock with a stated value of $1,006,250 were entitled to notice of such event, which is referred to as a \u201ctrigger event\u201d in the designations, rights and preferences of this series of stock. This trigger event entitles the holders to request that we redeem the shares at a price per share equal to the sum of:\n\u2022 the greater of (a) 125% of the conversion amount and (b) the product of (i) the conversion rate in effect at the time as the holder delivers a notice of redemption to us and (ii) the greatest closing sale price of the common stock beginning on the date immediately preceding such event of default and ending on the date the holder delivers the notice of redemption,\n\u2022 the make-whole additional amount per preferred share being redeemed; and\n\u2022 default interest at the rate of 1.5% per month.\nWe do not know if any holder will exercise its right to require us to redeem the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, or, if a redemption is exercised and we do not redeem the shares, require us to adjust the conversion price of the Series A convertible preferred stock. At the holder\u2019s option, the holder may also choose to continue to hold the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock so as to take advantage of the 8% annual dividend or convert the shares into shares of our common stock. In the event we are required to redeem the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, our liquidity in future periods will be materially and adversely impacted. If the holders choose to convert the shares into shares of our common stock, the issuance of the shares will be dilutive to our existing common stockholders.\nOur common stock is quoted in the over the counter market on the OTC Markets.\nOur common stock is quoted in the over-the-counter market on the OTC Markets. The OTC Markets (formerly, the Pink Sheets) offers a quotation service to companies that are unable to list their securities on an exchange or for companies, such as ours, whose securities are not listed on an exchange or quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The requirements for quotation on the OTC Markets are less regulated than those of the OTC Bulletin Board or an exchange. Because our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is possible that even fewer brokers or dealers would be interested in making a market in our common stock which further adversely impacts its liquidity.\nThe tradability of our common stock could be limited under the penny stock regulations which may cause the holders of our common stock difficulty should they wish to sell the shares.\nBecause the quoted price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock could be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and trading in our common stock could be subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent prior to the transaction.SEC regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few brokers or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities and this limited liquidity will make it more difficult for an investor to sell his shares of our common stock in the secondary market should the investor wish to liquidate the investment.", "PERMNO": 92266, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "CDIIQ"}
