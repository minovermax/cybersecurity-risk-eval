RISK FACTORS.\nThe following discussion of risk factors may be important to understanding the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II-Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Discussions about the important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in Part II-Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and, in the future, could be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption to the global economy. The pandemic is adversely impacting and, in the future, could materially adversely impact our business, operations and financial results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u2022the duration of the pandemic;\n\u2022the effective distribution of vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 and the willingness of the population to take the vaccines;\n\u2022governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including quarantines, social distancing and other risk mitigating measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19;\n\u2022the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions, including the impact on the healthcare and higher education industries which are areas of significant focus for our business;\n\u2022the health and welfare of our employees, including our senior management team, practice leaders and managing directors, and their ongoing ability to serve clients and manage operations if they contract COVID-19;\n\u2022the impact on our key third-party vendors;\n\u2022the effect on the businesses in which we have invested;\n\u2022our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions and maintain adequate utilization levels, including as a result of travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and quarantine orders and people working from home;\n\u2022the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions;\n\u2022any disruption to the internet and related systems, which may impact our ability to provide our services and solutions remotely, and increased vulnerability to hackers or third parties seeking to disrupt operations; and\n\u2022any closures of our clients\u2019 offices and facilities.\nAdditionally, in some instances, clients have slowed down decision making, delayed planned work or are seeking to reduce the scope of current engagements or terminate existing agreements, which may continue. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties discussed below and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Resources\nAn inability to retain our senior management team and other managing directors would be detrimental to the success of our business.\nWe rely heavily on our senior management team, our practice leaders, and other managing directors; our ability to retain them is particularly important to our future success. Given the highly specialized nature of our services, the senior management team must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage an organization consisting of a diverse group of professionals. In addition, we rely on our senior management team and other managing directors to generate and market our business. Further, our senior management\u2019s and other managing directors\u2019 personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements. Members of our senior management team and our other managing directors\ncould choose to leave or join one of our competitors and some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. If one or more members of our senior management team or our other managing directors leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly, we could experience difficulty in securing and successfully completing engagements and managing our business properly, which could harm our business prospects and results of operations.\nOur inability to hire and retain talented people in an industry where there is great competition for talent could have a serious negative effect on our prospects and results of operations.\nOur business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor-intensive. Our success depends largely on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled professionals. Further, we must successfully maintain the right mix of professionals with relevant experience and skill sets as we continue to grow, as we expand into new service offerings, and as the market evolves. The loss of a significant number of our professionals, the inability to attract, hire, develop, train, and retain additional skilled personnel, or failure to maintain the right mix of professionals could have a serious negative effect on us, including our ability to manage, staff, and successfully complete our existing engagements and obtain new engagements. Qualified professionals are in great demand, and we face significant competition for both senior and junior professionals with the requisite credentials and experience. Our principal competition for talent comes from other consulting firms and accounting firms, as well as from organizations seeking to staff their internal professional positions. Many of these competitors may be able to offer greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices, career paths, or geographic locations than we do. Therefore, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled consultants we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully. Increasing competition for these revenue-generating professionals may also significantly increase our labor costs, which could negatively affect our margins and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Business Growth and Development\nWe may incur costs to support our business and the inability to effectively build a support structure for the business could have an adverse impact on our growth and profitability.\nWe have grown significantly since we commenced operations and have increased the number of our full-time professionals from 249 in 2002 to 3,807 as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, our considerable growth has placed demands on our management and our internal systems, procedures, and controls and will continue to do so in the near future. To successfully manage growth, we must periodically adjust and strengthen our operating, financial, accounting, and other systems, procedures, and controls, which may increase our total costs and may adversely affect our gross profits and our ability to sustain profitability if we do not generate increased revenues to offset the costs. As a public company, our information and control systems must enable us to prepare accurate and timely financial information and other required disclosures. If we discover deficiencies in our existing information and control systems that impede our ability to satisfy our reporting requirements, we must successfully implement improvements to those systems in an efficient and timely manner.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we began the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system designed to improve the efficiency of our internal operational, financial and administrative activities. In January 2021, we went live with the new ERP system, and we continue to progress with additional functionality and integrations. The full implementation of a new ERP system in its entirety, which will take place over several years, subjects us to inherent costs and risks including substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, potential disruption of our internal control structure, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new system, demand on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transition. Our system implementation may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing a new ERP system may cause disruptions or have an adverse effect on our business operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.\nOur international expansion could result in additional risks.\nWe operate both domestically and internationally, including in Canada, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Although historically our international operations have been limited, we intend to continue to expand internationally. Such expansion may result in additional risks that are not present domestically and which could adversely affect our business or our results of operations, including:\n\u2022compliance with additional U.S. regulations and those of other nations applicable to international operations;\n\u2022cultural and language differences;\n\u2022employment laws, including immigration laws affecting the mobility of employees, and rules and related social and cultural factors;\n\u2022losses related to start-up costs, lack of revenue, higher costs due to low utilization, and delays in purchase decisions by prospective clients;\n\u2022currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;\n\u2022restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences and limitations on our ability to utilize losses generated in our foreign operations;\n\u2022different regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u2022different or less stable political and economic environments;\n\u2022greater personal security risks for employees traveling to or located in unstable locations; and\n\u2022civil disturbances or other catastrophic events.\nFurther, conducting business abroad subjects us to increased regulatory compliance and oversight. For example, we are subject to laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which increases the risk from our international operations relative to our competitors who do not operate outside the United States. A failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions as well as substantial civil and criminal penalties assessed against us and our employees.\nIn addition, expanding into new geographic areas and expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market. If we cannot manage the risks associated with new service offerings or new locations effectively, we are unlikely to be successful in these efforts, which could harm our ability to sustain profitability and our business prospects.\nAdditional hiring, departures, business acquisitions and dispositions could disrupt our operations, increase our costs or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to grow by hiring individuals or groups of individuals and by acquiring complementary businesses. However, we may be unable to identify, hire, acquire, or successfully integrate new employees and acquired businesses without substantial expense, delay, or other operational or financial obstacles. From time to time, we will evaluate the total mix of services we provide and we may conclude that businesses may not achieve the results we previously expected. Competition for future hiring and acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the compensation we offer to potential employees or the prices we pay for businesses we wish to acquire. In addition, we may be unable to achieve the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from any hiring or acquisition, as well as any disposition, including those we have completed so far. New acquisitions could also negatively impact existing practices and cause current employees to depart. Hiring additional employees or acquiring businesses could also involve a number of additional risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s time, attention, and resources from managing and marketing our Company; the potential assumption of liabilities of an acquired business; the inability to attain the expected synergies with an acquired business; and the perception of inequalities if different groups of employees are eligible for different benefits and incentives or are subject to different policies and programs.\nSelling practices and shutting down operations present similar challenges in a service business. Dispositions not only require management\u2019s time, but they can impair existing relationships with clients or otherwise affect client satisfaction, particularly in situations where the divestiture eliminates only part of the complement of consulting services provided to a client. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against, liabilities related to a business sold.\nOur ability to maintain and attract new business depends upon our reputation, the professional reputation of our revenue-generating employees, and the quality of our services.\nAs a professional services firm, our ability to secure new engagements depends heavily upon our reputation and the individual reputations of our professionals. Any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our employees, including not meeting client expectations or misconduct by our employees, could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new engagements and clients. Similarly, because we obtain many of our new engagements from former or current clients or from referrals by those clients or by law firms that we have worked with in the past, any client that questions the quality of our work or that of our consultants could impair our ability to secure additional new engagements and clients.\nThe consulting services industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe consulting services industry in which we operate includes a large number of participants and is intensely competitive. We face competition from other business operations and financial consulting firms, general management consulting firms, the consulting practices of major accounting firms, technical and economic advisory firms, regional and specialty consulting firms, consulting divisions of our technology partners, and the internal professional resources of organizations. In addition, because there are relatively low barriers to entry, we expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the business operations and financial consulting industries. Competition in\nseveral of the sectors in which we operate is particularly intense as many of our competitors are seeking to expand their market share in these sectors. Many of our competitors have a greater national and international presence, as well as have a significantly greater number of personnel, financial, technical, and marketing resources. In addition, these competitors may generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do. Some of our competitors may also have lower overhead and other costs and, therefore, may be able to more effectively compete through lower cost service offerings. Our ability to compete also depends in part on the ability of our competitors to hire, retain, and motivate skilled professionals, the price at which others offer comparable services, the ability of our competitors to offer new and valuable products and services to clients, and our competitors\u2019 responsiveness to their clients. If we are unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Industry and Customer Concentration\nThe healthcare and education industries are areas of significant focus for our business, and factors that adversely affect the financial condition of these industries could consequently affect our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from clients in the healthcare and education industries. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by conditions affecting these industries, both generally and those specific to the types of clients we serve in these industries, including hospitals and health systems, academic medical centers, and higher education institutions. The healthcare and education industries are highly regulated and are subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Uncertainty in any of these areas could cause our clients to delay or postpone decisions to use our services. Existing and new federal and state laws and regulations affecting the healthcare and education industries could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our clients to incur additional costs, and could restrict our or our clients\u2019 operations.\nOur healthcare and education clients operate in highly regulated industries. Regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could reduce the demand for our services, decreasing our competitive position or potentially rendering certain of our service offerings obsolete, change client buying patterns or decision making or require us to make unplanned modifications to our service offerings, which could require additional time and investment. If we fail to accurately anticipate the application of the laws and regulations affecting our clients and the industries they serve, if anticipated changes in regulation or regulatory uncertainty impact client buying patterns, or if such laws and regulations decrease our competitive position or limit the applicability of our service offerings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Similarly, certain of our healthcare and education clients may experience or anticipate experiencing financial distress or face complex challenges as a result of general economic conditions or operations-specific reasons. Such clients may not have the financial resources or stakeholder support to start new projects or to continue existing projects.\nSpecifically with respect to healthcare, many healthcare laws are complex and their application to us, our clients, or the specific services and relationships we have with our clients are not always clear. In addition, federal and state legislatures have periodically introduced programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and continue to consider further significant reforms. Due to the significant implementation issues arising under these laws and potential new legislation, it is unclear what long-term effects they will have on the healthcare industry and in turn on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of new laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nThere are many factors that could affect the purchasing practices, operations, and, ultimately, the operating funds of healthcare and education organizations, such as reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, student loan policies or regulations, federal and state budgetary considerations, consolidation in either industry, and regulation, litigation, and general economic conditions. In particular, we could be required to make unplanned modifications of our products and services (which would require additional time and investment) or we could suffer reductions in demand for our products and services as a result of changes in regulations affecting either industry, such as changes in the way that healthcare organizations are paid for their services (e.g., based on patient outcomes instead of services provided).\nIn addition, state tax authorities have challenged the tax-exempt status of some hospitals and other healthcare facilities claiming such status on the basis that they are operating as charitable and/or religious organizations. If the tax-exempt status of any of our clients is revoked or compromised by new legislation or interpretation of existing legislation, that client\u2019s financial health could be adversely affected, which could adversely impact demand for our services, our sales, revenue, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of clients, and our engagement agreements, including those related to our largest clients, can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty, which may cause our operating results to be unpredictable and may result in unexpected declines in our utilization and revenues.\nAs a consulting firm, we have derived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients. Our clients typically retain us on an engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under fixed-term contracts. The volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from year to year, and a major client in one fiscal period may not require or may decide not to use our services in any subsequent fiscal period. Moreover, a large portion of our new engagements comes from existing clients.\nAccordingly, the failure to obtain new large engagements or multiple engagements from existing or new clients could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenues we generate.\nIn addition, almost all of our engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty. In client engagements that involve multiple engagements or stages, there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements. For clients in bankruptcy, a bankruptcy court could elect not to retain our interim management consultants, terminate our retention, require us to reduce our fees for the duration of an engagement, elect not to approve claims against fees earned by us prior to or after the bankruptcy filing, or subject previously paid amounts to be returned to the bankruptcy estate as preferential payments under the bankruptcy code.\nTerminations of engagements, cancellations of portions of the project plan, delays in the work schedule, or reductions in fees could result from factors unrelated to our services. When engagements are terminated or reduced, we lose the associated future revenues, and we may not be able to recover associated costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the negative impact. In addition, our clients\u2019 ability to terminate engagements with little or no notice and without penalty makes it difficult to predict our operating results in any particular fiscal period.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nOur business is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and will require additional investments in order to grow and meet the demands of our clients.\nWe depend on the use of sophisticated technologies and systems. Some of our practices provide services that are increasingly dependent on the use of software applications and systems that we do not own and could become unavailable. Moreover, our technology platforms will require continuing investments by us in order to expand existing service offerings and develop complementary services. For example, we have subscription-based offerings that require us to incur costs associated with upgrades and maintenance that could impact profit margins associated with those offerings and related services. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure while continuing to improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace.\nAdverse changes to our relationships with key third-party vendors, or in the business of our key third-party vendors, could unfavorably impact our business.\nA portion of our services and solutions depend on technology or software provided by third-party vendors. Some of these third-party vendors refer potential clients to us, and others require that we obtain their permission prior to accessing their software while performing services for our clients. These third-party vendors could terminate their relationship with us without cause and with little or no notice, which could limit our service offerings and harm our financial condition and operating results. In addition, if a third-party vendor\u2019s business changes, is reduced or fails to adapt to changing market demands, that could adversely affect our business. Moreover, if third-party technology or software that is important to our business does not continue to be available or utilized within the marketplace, or if the services that we provide to clients is no longer relevant in the marketplace, our business may be unfavorably impacted.\nWe could experience system failures, service interruptions, or security breaches that could negatively impact our business.\nOur organization is comprised of employees who work on matters throughout the United States and overseas. Our technology platform is a \u201cvirtual office\u201d from which we all operate. We may be subject to disruption to our operating systems from technology events that are beyond our control, including the possibility of failures at third-party data centers, disruptions to the internet, natural disasters, power losses, and malicious attacks. In addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure and operating systems, including the internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks, or other attacks by third parties seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information or similar physical or electronic breaches of security. While we have taken and are taking reasonable steps to prevent and mitigate the damage of such events, including implementation of system security measures, information backup, and disaster recovery processes, those steps may not be effective and there can be no assurance that any such steps can be effective against all possible risks. We will need to continue to invest in technology in order to achieve redundancies necessary to prevent service interruptions. Access to our systems as a result of a security breach, the failure of our systems, or the loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability, or regulatory penalties and disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRisks Related to Legal Matters\nOur reputation could be damaged and we could incur additional liabilities if we fail to protect client and employee data through our own accord or if our information systems are breached.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, partners, and employees. These locations include Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore, and India, all of which have their own either recently updated or potential new data protection laws. The breadth and complexity of\nthis infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches which could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nIn providing services to clients, we may manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data and protected health information. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and international laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018. In addition, many states, U.S. federal governmental authorities and non-U.S. jurisdictions have adopted, proposed or are considering adopting or proposing, additional data security and/or data privacy statutes or regulations. Continued governmental focus on data security and privacy may lead to additional legislative and regulatory action, which could increase the complexity of doing business. The increased emphasis on information security and the requirements to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign data security and privacy laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If any person, including any of our employees or third-party vendors, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls or contractual obligations with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. We maintain certain insurance coverages for cybersecurity incidents through our directors and officers insurance policy, in amounts we believe to be reasonable and at a cost that is included in our general insurance premiums.\nIn addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future.\nOur engagements could result in professional liability, which could be very costly and hurt our reputation.\nOur engagements typically involve complex analyses and the exercise of professional judgment. As a result, we are subject to the risk of professional liability. From time to time, lawsuits with respect to our work are pending. Litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached any other obligations could expose us to significant legal liabilities and, regardless of outcome, is often very costly, could distract our management, could damage our reputation, and could harm our financial condition and operating results. We also face increased litigation risk as a result of an expanded workforce. In addition, certain of our engagements, including interim management engagements and corporate restructurings, involve greater risks than other consulting engagements. We are not always able to include provisions in our engagement agreements that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services. While we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to liability arising out of our consulting engagements, these efforts may be ineffective and an actual or alleged error or omission on our part or the part of our client or other third parties in one or more of our engagements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we carry professional liability insurance to cover many of these types of claims, but the policy limits and the breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of legal defense. For example, we provide services on engagements in which the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage. If we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement, we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we incur liability in connection with service offering innovation, including new or expanded service offerings.\nWe may grow our business through service offering innovation, including by entering into new or expanded lines of business beyond our core services. To the extent we enter into new or expanded lines of business, we may face new risks and uncertainties, including the possibility these new or expanded lines of business involve greater risks than our core services, that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, that the required investment of capital and other resources is greater than anticipated, and that we lose existing clients due to the perception that we are no longer focusing on our core business. Entry into new or expanded lines of business may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. For example, our recently launched Huron Managed Services business provides revenue cycle managed services to hospitals and health systems. These services include the coding, preparation, submission and collection of claims for medical service to payers for reimbursement. Such claims are governed by U.S. federal and state laws. U.S. federal law provides civil liability to any persons that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, a claim to a payer, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans, seeking payment for any services or items that overbills or bills for services or items that have not been provided to the patient. U.S. federal law may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. In addition, federal and state law regulates the collection of debt and may impose monetary penalties for violating those regulations. In connection with these laws, we may be subjected to U.S. federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended and private payers may file claims against us. Any investigation or proceeding related to these laws, even if unwarranted or without merit, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property rights in our \u201cHuron Consulting Group\u201d name are important, and any inability to use that name could negatively impact our ability to build brand identity.\nWe believe that establishing, maintaining, and enhancing the \u201cHuron Consulting Group\u201d name and \u201cHuron\u201d brand is important to our business. We are, however, aware of a number of other companies that use names containing \u201cHuron.\u201d There could be potential trade name or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these similar names and marks and those users may have trade name or service mark rights that are senior to ours. If another company were to successfully challenge our right to use our name, or if we were unable to prevent a competitor from using a name that is similar to our name, our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted.\nConflicts of interest could preclude us from accepting engagements thereby causing decreased utilization and revenues.\nWe provide services in connection with bankruptcy and other proceedings that usually involve sensitive client information and frequently are adversarial. In connection with bankruptcy proceedings, we are required by law to be \u201cdisinterested\u201d and may not be able to provide multiple services to a particular client. In addition, our engagement agreement with a client or other business reasons may preclude us from accepting engagements from time to time with the client's competitors or adversaries. Moreover, in many industries in which we provide services, there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances. These consolidations and alliances reduce the number of companies that may seek our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interest. If we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason, our consultants may become underutilized, which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Related to Financial Management and Performance\nOur financial results could suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our consultants, or if we are unable to deliver our services due to factors that disrupt travel to our client sites.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent on the utilization and billing rates of our professionals. Utilization of our professionals is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the number and size of client engagements;\n\u2022the timing of the commencement, completion and termination of engagements, which in many cases is unpredictable;\n\u2022our ability to transition our consultants efficiently from completed engagements to new engagements;\n\u2022the hiring of additional consultants because there is generally a transition period for new consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate;\n\u2022unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;\n\u2022our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate level of consultants; and\n\u2022conditions affecting the industries in which we practice as well as general economic conditions.\nThe billing rates of our consultants that we are able to charge are also affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our clients\u2019 perception of our ability to add value through our services;\n\u2022the market demand for the services we provide;\n\u2022an increase in the number of engagements in the government sector, which are subject to federal contracting regulations;\n\u2022introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our competition and the pricing policies of our competitors; and\n\u2022current economic conditions.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate overall utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our consultants, our financial results could materially suffer. Traditionally, most of our consultants have performed services at the physical locations of our clients. Starting in 2020 and in response to the proliferation of the coronavirus, substantially all of our services were delivered remotely. If our\nconsultants are unable to continue delivering services remotely or if we are out of step with a general market return to in person service delivery, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of certain factors, some of which may be outside of our control.\nA key element of our strategy is to market our products and services directly to certain large organizations, such as health systems and acute care hospitals, and to increase the number of our products and services utilized by existing clients. The sales cycle for some of our products and services is often lengthy and may involve significant commitment of client personnel. As a consequence, the commencement date of a client engagement often cannot be accurately forecasted. As discussed below, certain of our client contracts contain terms that result in revenue that is deferred and cannot be recognized until the occurrence of certain events. As a result, the period of time between contract signing and recognition of associated revenue may be lengthy, and we are not able to predict with certainty the period in which revenue will be recognized.\nFee discounts, pressure to not increase or even decrease our rates, and less advantageous contract terms could result in the loss of clients, lower revenues and operating income, higher costs, and less profitable engagements. More discounts or write-offs than we expect in any period would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOther fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of other factors, some of which are not within our control, including:\n\u2022the timing and volume of client invoices processed and payments received, which may affect the fees payable to us under certain of our engagements;\n\u2022client decisions regarding renewal or termination of their contracts;\n\u2022the amount and timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses; and\n\u2022unforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and other settlement gains or losses.\nWe base our annual employee bonus expense upon our expected annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) for that year. If we experience lower adjusted EBITDA in a quarter without a corresponding change to our full-year adjusted EBITDA expectation, our estimated bonus expense will not be reduced, which will have a negative impact on our quarterly results of operations for that quarter. Our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. The results of one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nRevenues from our performance-based engagements are difficult to predict, and the timing and extent of recovery of our costs is uncertain.\nWe have engagement agreements under which our fees include a significant performance-based component. Performance-based fees are contingent on the achievement of specific measures, such as our clients meeting cost-saving or other contractually-defined goals. The achievement of these contractually-defined goals may be subject to acknowledgment by the client and is often impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the actions of the client or other third parties. To the extent that any revenue is contingent upon the achievement of a performance target, we recognize such revenue using a process that requires us to make significant management judgments, estimates, and assumptions. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions we have used for revenue recognition are reasonable, subsequent changes could have a material impact to our future financial results. The percentage of our revenues derived from performance-based fees for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was 9.2%, 8.9%, and 6.1%, respectively. A greater number of performance-based fee arrangements may result in increased volatility in our working capital requirements and greater variations in our quarter-to-quarter results, which could affect the price of our common stock. In addition, an increase in the proportion of performance-based fee arrangements may temporarily offset the positive effect on our operating results from an increase in our utilization rate until the related revenues are recognized.\nThe profitability of our fixed-fee engagements with clients may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements.\nWhen making proposals for fixed-fee engagements, we estimate the costs and timing for completing the engagements. These estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and consultants as we plan to deploy them on engagements. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-fee engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which would have an adverse effect on our\nprofit margin. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, fixed-fee engagements represented 41.4%, 45.8%, and 47.4%, of our revenues, respectively.\nOur business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full-year financial guidance that we provide publicly.\nWe provide full-year financial guidance to the public based upon our expectations regarding our financial performance. While we believe that our annual financial guidance provides investors and analysts with insight to our view of the Company\u2019s future performance, such financial guidance is based on assumptions that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results. If we fail to meet the full-year financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise or suspend such guidance during the year, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Capital Resources\nOur obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of certain of the equity interests in our subsidiaries and a lien on substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiary grantors. If we default on these obligations, our lenders may foreclose on our assets, including our pledged equity interest in our subsidiaries.\nWe entered into a second amended and restated security agreement with Bank of America (the \u201cSecurity Agreement\u201d) and a second amended and restated pledge agreement (the \u201cPledge Agreement\u201d) in connection with our entry into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2015 (as amended and restated, the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Security Agreement and to secure our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, we granted our lenders a first-priority lien, subject to permitted liens, on substantially all of the personal property assets that we and the subsidiary grantors own. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, we granted our lenders a security interest in 100% of the voting stock or other equity interests in our domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock or other equity interests in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. If we default on our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness and may be able to exercise their liens on the equity interests subject to the Pledge Agreement and their liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiary grantors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, the covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, such as the incurrence of additional indebtedness, certain investments, certain acquisitions and dispositions, and the payment of dividends.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and obligations, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable-rate debt, and adversely affect our financial results.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had outstanding indebtedness of $200.0 million on our revolving line of credit that becomes due and payable in full upon maturity on September 27, 2024, and $3.3 million principal amount of our promissory note due March 1, 2024. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest, or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance. If we are unable to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or dilutive. Our ability to refinance our current indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the current indebtedness or future indebtedness.\nThe interest rates on our revolving line of credit and promissory note are linked to LIBOR. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates will develop. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the method and rates used to calculate our interest rates and/or payments on our debt may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates and/or payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. While we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR, such efforts may not prove successful. Furthermore, the U.S. or global financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences such as exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates; making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; or reducing our capacity to obtain additional financing and flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Asset Impairment\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial amount of our total assets, and we may be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge for these assets if the performance of one or more of our reporting units falls below our expectations.\nOur total assets reflect a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $614.7 million, or 58%, of our total assets. Goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets other than goodwill represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill. Our intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names, customer contracts, technology and software, and non-competition agreements, all of which were acquired through business combinations. We evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges totaling $59.8 million related to the Company\u2019s Business Advisory segment. During 2019 and 2018, we did not record any non-cash goodwill impairment charges. No material impairment charges for intangible assets were recorded in 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying our valuation methodology are reasonable, these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not a non-cash goodwill impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of our reporting units will be consistent with our projections. We will monitor any changes to our assumptions and will evaluate goodwill as deemed warranted during future periods. Any significant decline in our operations could result in additional non-cash goodwill impairment charges.\nRefer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d within Part I - Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 4 \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our business combinations, goodwill, intangible assets, and impairment tests performed.\nWe may incur impairment charges with respect to our convertible debt investment in Shorelight.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we invested $27.9 million, in the form of zero coupon convertible debt, in Shorelight Holdings, LLC (\u201cShorelight\u201d), the parent company of Shorelight Education. In the first quarter of 2020, we invested an additional $13.0 million, in the form of 1.69% convertible debt with a senior liquidation preference. Our investment is carried at its fair value of $64.4 million as of December 31, 2020, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in Shorelight is in an unrealized gain position. If the investment were to be in an unrealized loss position due to significant credit deterioration of Shorelight, we would recognize an allowance to decrease the carrying value of the investment to the fair value, which may be reversed in the event that the credit of Shorelight improves. As of December 31, 2020, we have not recognized any credit allowance on our investment. In the future, if there are adverse developments in Shorelight's business that may be the result of events within or outside of Shorelight's control, we may incur impairment charges with respect to our convertible debt investment, which could materially impact our results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nExpanding our service offerings may involve additional risks and may not be profitable.\nWe may choose to develop new service offerings or eliminate service offerings because of market opportunities or client demands. Developing new service offerings involves inherent risks, including:\n\u2022our inability to estimate demand for the new service offerings;\n\u2022competition from more established market participants;\n\u2022exposure to new legal and operational risks;\n\u2022a lack of market understanding;\n\u2022unanticipated expenses to recruit and hire qualified consultants and to market our new service offerings; and\n\u2022unanticipated challenges with service delivery.\nChanges in capital markets, legal or regulatory requirements, and general economic or other factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services, in which case our revenues and profitability could decline.\nA number of factors outside of our control affect demand for our services. These include:\n\u2022fluctuations in U.S. and global economies;\n\u2022the U.S. or global financial markets and the availability, costs, and terms of credit;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations; and\n\u2022other economic factors and general business conditions.\nFor example, some portion of the services we provide may be considered by our clients to be more discretionary in nature, as the demand for the services may be impacted by economic slowdowns. We are not able to predict the positive or negative effects that future events or changes to the U.S. or global economy, financial markets, or regulatory and business environment could have on our operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. at the state and federal level and also in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable U.S. state, federal or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could materially affect our tax expense and profitability.\nFuture changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, and their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly as taxing jurisdictions face an increasing number of political, budgetary and other fiscal challenges. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic and other factors outside of our control, making it increasingly difficult for multinational corporations like ourselves to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. As a result, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in the jurisdictions where we operate, including the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, as well as our effective income tax rate.", "PERMNO": 90409, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "HURN"}
