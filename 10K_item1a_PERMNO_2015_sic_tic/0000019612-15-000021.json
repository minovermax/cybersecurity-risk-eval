{"cik": "19612", "company": "CHEMICAL FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Corporation's business model is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Although the Corporation seeks ways to manage these risks and develop programs to control those risks that management can, the Corporation ultimately cannot predict the future or control all of the risks to which it is subject. Actual results may differ materially from management's expectations. Some of these significant risks and uncertainties are discussed below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Corporation faces. Additional risks and uncertainties of which the Corporation is unaware, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that adversely affect the Corporation and its business. If any of these risks were to occur, the Corporation's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Corporation's common stock per share could decline significantly.\nInvestments in the Corporation's common stock involve risk.\nThe market price of the Corporation's common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nVariations in quarterly or annual results of operations\n\u2022\nChanges in dividends paid per share\n\u2022\nDeterioration in asset quality, including declining real estate values\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by, or involving, the Corporation or its competitors\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions\n\u2022\nRegulatory actions, including changes to regulatory capital levels, the components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated\n\u2022\nNew regulations that limit or significantly change the Corporation's ability to continue to offer existing banking products\n\u2022\nVolatility of stock market prices and volumes\n\u2022\nIssuance of additional shares of common stock or other debt or equity securities of the Corporation\n\u2022\nChanges in market valuations of similar companies\n\u2022\nUncertainties and fluctuations in the financial markets\n\u2022\nChanges in securities analysts' estimates of financial performance or recommendations\n\u2022\nNew litigation or contingencies or changes in existing litigation or contingencies\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors\n\u2022\nBreaches in information security systems of the Corporation and/or its customers and competitors\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting policies or procedures required by standard setting or other regulatory agencies\n\u2022\nNew developments in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding the financial services industry, the Corporation and/or its competitors\n\u2022\nRumors or erroneous information\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, either nationally or globally, including the impact of a downgrade of U.S. government obligations by one of the credit agencies and the adverse effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe\nThe Corporation is subject to lending risk.\nA significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most loans originated by the Corporation are secured, but some loans are unsecured depending on the nature of the loan. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing repayment includes a wide variety of real and personal property that may be insufficient to cover the amounts owed. Collateral values are adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events.\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to net income that represents management's estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management's continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, the value of real estate, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions and declines in real estate values affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Corporation's control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Corporation's allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Any significant increase in the allowance for loan losses would likely result in a significant decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned \"Allowance for Loan Losses\" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 4 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Corporation's process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt the Corporation's business and dilute shareholder value.\nThe Corporation seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nDelay in completing an acquisition due to the regulatory approval process or litigation relating to the acquisition\n\u2022\nThe recording of assets and liabilities of the target company at fair value may materially dilute shareholder value at the transaction date and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations\n\u2022\nThe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger targets\n\u2022\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company\n\u2022\nThe estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate\n\u2022\nExposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company\n\u2022\nThe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion\n\u2022\nThe diversion of the Corporation's management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses\n\u2022\nThe introduction of new products and services into the Corporation's business\n\u2022\nPotential disruption to the Corporation's business\n\u2022\nThe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on the Corporation's results of operations\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company\n\u2022\nDifficulty in estimating the value of the target company\n\u2022\nPotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company\n\u2022\nDifficulty or unanticipated expense associated with converting the communication and information systems of the target company to those of the Corporation\nThe transactions may be more expensive to complete and the anticipated benefits, including cost savings and strategic gains, may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events, including the economic and financial conditions within the State of Michigan.\nThe Corporation regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations and transactions may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, dilution of the Corporation's tangible book value, net income per common share and ownership interest may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nPlease see the risk factors relating to our pending acquisitions of Monarch Community Bancorp, Inc. (Monarch) and Lake Michigan Financial Corporation (Lake Michigan) set forth under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" which are here incorporated by reference.\nIn connection with the pending merger with Monarch, two purported Monarch stockholders have filed putative class action lawsuits against Monarch, its board of directors, Monarch Community Bank, the Corporation and Chemical Bank. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger. Monarch and the Corporation have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs regarding the settlement of these lawsuits, which is subject to court approval. If this litigation is not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to Monarch and the Corporation, including any costs associated with indemnification. Additional lawsuits may be filed against Monarch, the Corporation or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the merger. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the effective time of the merger may adversely affect Monarch's and the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.\nThe Corporation may face increased pressure from purchasers of its residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans.\nThe Corporation sells fixed rate long-term residential mortgage loans it originates in the secondary market. Purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, are increasing their efforts to seek to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold when losses are incurred on a loan previously sold due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser's purchase criteria. As a result, the Corporation may face increased pressure from purchasers of its residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans and it may face increasing expenses to defend against such claims. If the Corporation is required in the future to repurchase loans previously sold, reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold, or if it incurs increasing expenses to defend against such claims, the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nThe Corporation holds general obligation municipal bonds in its investment securities portfolio. If one or more issuers of these bonds were to become insolvent and default on its obligations under the bonds, it could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation.\nMunicipal bonds held by the Corporation totaled $352 million at December 31, 2014, and were issued by many different municipalities with no significant concentration in any single municipality. The Corporation held no debt obligations issued by the City of Detroit at December 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that the financial conditions of these municipalities will not be materially and adversely affected by future economic conditions. If one or more of the issuers of these bonds were to become insolvent and default on their obligations under the bonds, it could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation.\nGeneral economic conditions, and in particular conditions in the State of Michigan, affect the Corporation's business.\nThe Corporation is affected by general economic conditions in the United States, although most directly within Michigan. The Corporation's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the State of Michigan and the specific local markets in which the Corporation operates. The economic conditions in these local markets have a significant impact on the demand for the Corporation's products and services as well as the ability of the Corporation's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Corporation's deposit funding sources. Substantially all of the Corporation's loans are to individuals and businesses in Michigan. Consequently, any prolonged decline in Michigan's economy could have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. A significant decline or a prolonged period of the lack of improvement in general economic conditions could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Corporation does not adjust to changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer.\nThe Corporation's ability to maintain its financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend largely on its ability to continue to grow its loan portfolio and also, in part, on its ability to maintain and grow its core deposit customer base and expand its financial services to its existing and/or new customers. In addition to other banks, competitors include savings and loan associations, credit unions, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in the economic environment within the State of Michigan, regulation, and changes in technology and product delivery systems. New competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for the Corporation's customers and services. Financial services and products are also constantly changing. The Corporation's financial performance will also depend, in part, upon customer demand for its products and services and its ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits and lending opportunities.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce the Corporation's net income and cash flow.\nThe Corporation's net income and cash flow depends, to a great extent, on the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Market interest rates are beyond the Corporation's control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and competition. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, the interest received on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any significant adverse effects of changes in interest rates on the Corporation's\nresults of operations, or any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned \"Net Interest Income\" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \"Market Risk\" in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, located elsewhere in this report, for further discussion related to the Corporation's management of interest rate risk.\nThe global market crisis has triggered a series of reductions in interest rates. During 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept the target federal funds rate between zero and 0.25%. The low interest rate environment has resulted in lower yields on interest-earning assets, which could have an adverse impact on the Corporation's revenue and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may be required to pay additional deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings.\nDepending upon the magnitude of future losses that the FDIC deposit insurance fund suffers, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases or assessments in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule based on future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates than those currently projected or special assessments could have an adverse impact on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is subject to liquidity risk in its operations, which could adversely affect its ability to fund various obligations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If the Corporation is unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then its business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively effected.\nEvaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's net income, projected net income and financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and/or value of the underlying asset and also assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon the Corporation's quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nAdditionally, the Corporation's management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) the Corporation's intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. Impairments to the carrying value of the Corporation's investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. The Corporation tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the \"reporting unit\" to which the goodwill relates. Substantially all of the Corporation's goodwill at December 31, 2014 was recorded on the books of Chemical Bank. The fair value of Chemical Bank is impacted by the performance of its business and other factors. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the Corporation must write-down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management's determination include the performance of the Corporation, including the ability to generate taxable net income. If, based on available information, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. As of December 31, 2014, the Corporation did not carry a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Future facts and circumstances may require a valuation allowance. Charges to establish a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Corporation is required to increase its valuation allowance with respect to its mortgage servicing rights asset, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Corporation's mortgage servicing rights asset had a book value of $12.2 million and a fair value of approximately $15.0 million. The Corporation had a valuation allowance of $0.2 million at December 31, 2014 with respect to a portion of its mortgage servicing rights asset related to the loan servicing portfolio it acquired in the Northwestern transaction. If the Corporation is required to increase its valuation allowance with respect to its mortgage servicing rights asset in the future, the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nThe Corporation may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation and Chemical Bank are regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of the normal course of business. The Corporation's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation or cause the Corporation to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the Corporation's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Corporation may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of its business, the Corporation may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, the Corporation might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at the Corporation's sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. The Corporation may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation depends upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit to customers, the Corporation relies on information provided to it by its customers, including financial statements and other financial information. The Corporation may also rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and on reports of independent auditors on financial statements. The Corporation's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent that the Corporation extends credit in reliance on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are misleading or other information provided by customers that is false or misleading.\nThe Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nThe Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks within the various markets where the Corporation operates, as well as internet banks. The Corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. The Corporation competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making new loans. Technology has lowered barriers to entry into the market and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Corporation's competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures, such as credit unions that are not subject to federal income tax. Due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Corporation can.\nThe Corporation's ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets\n\u2022\nThe ability to expand the Corporation's market position\n\u2022\nThe ability to keep up-to-date with technological advancements in both delivering new products and maintaining existing products, while continuing to control operating costs\n\u2022\nThe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands\n\u2022\nThe rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors\n\u2022\nCustomer satisfaction with the Corporation's level of service\n\u2022\nIndustry and general economic trends\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Corporation's competitive position, which could adversely affect the Corporation's growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Corporation loses members of its senior management team upon whom it is dependent, it may be less effective in managing its operations and may have more difficulty achieving its strategic objectives.\nThe Corporation believes its success depends on the continued service of its key executives. Although the Corporation currently intends to retain its existing management, it cannot provide assurances that these individuals, none of whom are party to employment agreements with it, will remain with the Corporation. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of the Corporation's key executives or its inability to find suitable replacements within a reasonable period of time following any such loss, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's ability to execute its business strategy and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact the Corporation or the businesses in which it is engaged.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. The Corporation and Chemical Bank are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of their operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance fund, and not to benefit the Corporation's shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact the Corporation or its ability to increase the value of its business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase the Corporation's regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect its regulatory capital levels. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Corporation or Chemical Bank could require the Corporation to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Corporation and its shareholders.\nThe Corporation may face increased regulatory capital requirements in the future under BASEL III.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the FDIC approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) capital guidelines for U.S. banks (commonly known as Basel III). Under the final rules, which begin for the Corporation and Chemical Bank on January 1, 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period through January 1, 2019, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Corporation. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CET ratio) of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively results in a minimum CET ratio of 7.0%. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% (which, with the capital conservation buffer, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% when fully phased-in), effectively results in a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (with the capital conservation buffer fully phased-in), and requires a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. While management anticipates that the capital ratios for the Corporation and Chemical Bank under Basel III will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements, there can be no assurance that such will be the case. If either the Corporation or Chemical Bank are unable to meet or exceed the applicable minimum capital requirements, they may become subject to supervisory actions ranging in severity from losing financial holding company status, to being precluded from making acquisitions, engaging in new activities or becoming subject to informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions.\nIf the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nThe Corporation is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support its operations. The Corporation may need to raise additional capital to support its continued growth or in response to regulatory requirements. The Corporation's ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside the Corporation's control, and on its financial performance. The Corporation cannot assure that it will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to the Corporation. If the Corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be materially limited.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may have a significant impact on the Corporation and results of its operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, established the new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. The CFPB has issued significant new regulations that impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing. Those regulations became effective in January 2014. In addition, the CFPB has issued regulations that will change the disclosure requirements and forms used under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Compliance with these new laws and regulations and other regulations under consideration by the CFPB will likely result in additional costs and could change the products and/or services that are currently being offered, which could be significant and could adversely impact the Corporation's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nUnder the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged in certain electronic debit and prepaid card transactions are \u201creasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. These rules established the maximum permissible interchange fee for electronic debit transactions as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. In addition, an issuer may charge up to 1 cent on each transaction as a fraud prevention adjustment if the issuer meets certain fraud prevention standards. These rules are applicable to financial institutions that have total assets of $10 billion or more. If the Corporation were to become subject to the rules established as a result of the Durbin Amendment, the Corporation would be subject to the cap on interchange fees, which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by the Corporation or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the event of default of the Corporation's counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. The Corporation can give no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Corporation's controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Corporation's internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A significant failure or circumvention of the Corporation's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm the Corporation's business.\nAs part of its business, the Corporation collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of itself and other third parties. Despite the security measures the Corporation has in place for its facilities and systems, and the security measures of its third party service providers, the Corporation may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by the Corporation or by its vendors, could severely damage the Corporation's reputation, expose it to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt the Corporation's operations and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business.\nThe Corporation's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nThe Corporation relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business and deliver its products. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Corporation's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Corporation's information systems or its customers' information or computer systems would not damage the Corporation's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Corporation to civil litigation and financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Corporation's business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Corporation's ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Corporation's deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to the Corporation's common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of the Corporation's common stock.\nIn the future, the Corporation may increase its capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of the Corporation's liquidation, its lenders and holders of its debt securities and preferred stock would receive a distribution of the Corporation's available assets before distributions to the holders of the Corporation's common stock. The Corporation's decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control. The Corporation cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings and debt financings. Future offerings could reduce the value of shares of the Corporation's common stock and dilute a shareholder's interest in the Corporation.\nThe Corporation relies on dividends from Chemical Bank for most of its revenue.\nThe Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from Chemical Bank. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from Chemical Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends on the Corporation's common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Chemical Bank may pay to the Corporation. In the event Chemical Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The earnings of Chemical Bank have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders. Over the long-term, cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings, as well as capital requirements, regulatory restraints and other factors affecting Chemical Bank.
