You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K and the reports we file with the SEC from time to time. Any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to grow and operate our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and have significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2015, the principal amount of our total indebtedness was approximately $479.1 million, and secured by liens on substantially all of our existing and future assets.\nThe existence and terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition by:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to generally adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to any of our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur ability to draw down borrowings under our credit facility depends in part on our compliance with financial covenants contained in the facility. An inability to draw down on our credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make capital expenditures, on our results of operations and on our liquidity. Further, failure to maintain the financial ratios required under our credit facility would constitute an event of default, allowing the lenders under our credit facility to declare the entire balance of any and all sums payable under the credit facility immediately due and payable. If a payment default or acceleration were to occur under our credit facility, holders of our $355 million principal amount of 8.25% Second Priority Senior Secured Promissory Notes due 2020 (\u201c2020 Senior Notes\u201d) would be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the 2020 Senior Notes.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and seek any potential refinancing of our indebtedness depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operations, financings or asset sales, which are subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, seasonality and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital\nresources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling our assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the conditions of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may also restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default under our credit facilities and the lenders under our 2020 Senior Notes and credit facility could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur ability to obtain adequate financing or raise capital in the future may be limited.\nWe depend, in part, upon borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations and contractual commitments. If we were called upon to fund all outstanding commitments, we may not have sufficient funds to do so. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include general economic conditions, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, and our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. Additionally, our suppliers may require us to pay cash in advance or obtain letters of credit as a condition to selling us their products and services. If we cannot access financing when needed, and on acceptable terms, we may be unable to continue to fund our capital requirements or contractual commitments, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nThe aviation services business is highly competitive.\nEach of our segments faces significant competition. We compete for most of our work with other helicopter operators and, for some operations, with fixed-wing operators and ground-based alternatives. Many of our contracts are awarded after competitive bidding, and competition for those contracts is generally intense. We have several major competitors and numerous small competitors operating in our aerial services markets. Our competitors may at times undercut our prices or could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. We may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors and the competitive pressures we face may result in reduced revenues and market share. If we are unable to adjust our costs relative to our pricing, our profitability will suffer. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, and may therefore be able to react to market conditions and compete more effectively than we do.\nWe depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of major customers. Several of our largest customers are governmental agencies or entities that may be subject to budget or other financial constraints. In light of the ongoing European financial crisis, there are heightened risks associated with our future revenue attributable to services provided in the region, including Greece and Italy. Revenue derived from our firefighting contracts under which we are paid for hours flown is influenced by outside factors, such as seasonality and weather conditions, that may negatively impact our future revenue. Similarly, in light of anticipated troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, there is a heightened risk of a decline in our future revenue attributable to contracts in the region. Should we lose one of our major customers for any reason, we may be unable to identify new opportunities sufficient to avoid a reduction in revenues and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nA significant portion of our Global Defense and Security revenue is derived from providing airlift services in Afghanistan.\nOur Global Defense and Security business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing airlift services in Afghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. government has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and began calendar year 2015 with approximately 10,000 military personnel in Afghanistan. The U.S. government announced plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan by approximately half before the end of calendar year 2016. Our Global Defense and Security revenue will likely continue to experience declines as troop reductions occur in Afghanistan. In addition, as a result of the already reduced level of flight activity in the Afghanistan region, we have seen increased pressure from our competitors in connection with new DoD contracts in other regions of the world where we operate, which we believe may negatively impact our pricing with respect to some of the new DoD contracts on which we bid.\nOur operations involve significant risks, which may result in hazards that may not be covered by our insurance or may increase the cost of our insurance.\nThe operation of aircraft inherently involves a high degree of risk. Hazards such as aircraft accidents, mechanical failures, collisions, fire, and adverse weather may result in loss of life, serious injury to employees and other persons, damage to property, losses of equipment and revenues, revocation of necessary governmental approvals and suspension or reduction of operations. Our insurance and indemnification arrangements may not cover all potential losses and are subject to deductibles, retentions, coverage limits, and coverage exceptions and, as a result, severe casualty losses or the expropriation or confiscation of significant assets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain our safety record, our ability to attract new customers and maintain our existing customers would be harmed.\nA favorable safety record is one of the primary factors a customer reviews in selecting an aviation provider. If we fail to maintain our safety and reliability record, our ability to attract new customers and maintain our current customers will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, safety violations could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny; increase our insurance rates and expense, which is a significant operating cost; or increase the difficulty of maintaining our existing insurance coverage in the future, which would adversely affect our operations.\nFactors beyond our control, including weather and seasonal fluctuations, may reduce aircraft flight hours, which would affect our revenues and operations.\nA significant portion of our operating revenue is dependent on actual flight hours, and a substantial portion of our direct costs are fixed. Flight hours could be negatively impacted by factors beyond our control and fluctuate depending on cyclical weather-related and seasonal limitations, which would affect our revenues and operations. In addition, generally our aircraft are not currently equipped to fly at night, reinforcing the seasonality of our business with more activity in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and less activity during the winter months. Poor visibility, high winds, and heavy precipitation can restrict the operation of helicopters and significantly reduce our flight hours. Reduced flight hours can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSome of our arrangements with customers are short-term, ad hoc, or \u201ccall when needed\u201d and may not be renewed.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues from arrangements with customers with terms of less than six months, ad hoc arrangements, and \u201ccall when needed\u201d contracts. There is a risk that customers may not continue to seek the same level of services from us as they have in the past or that they will not renew these arrangements or terminate them at short notice. Under \u201ccall when needed\u201d contracts, we pre-negotiate rates for providing services that customers may request that we perform (but which we are not typically obligated to perform) depending on their needs. The rates we charge for these contingent services are higher than the rates under stand-by arrangements, and we attempt to schedule our aircraft to maximize our revenue from these types of contracts. The ultimate value we derive from such contracts is subject to factors beyond our control, such as the severity and duration of fire seasons. In the past, several of our larger contracts have not been renewed for reasons unrelated to our performance, such as the financial condition of our customers or their decision to internalize the services we provided to them. If we are unable to retain or replace customers experiencing similar circumstances, our business and financial condition could suffer.\nForeign, domestic, federal, state and local government spending and mission priorities may change in a manner that materially and adversely affects our future revenues and limits our growth prospects.\nOur business depends upon continued government expenditures on programs that we support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time. Current foreign and domestic government spending levels on programs that we support may not be sustainable as a result of changes in government leadership, policies, or priorities. These or other factors could cause government agencies and departments to reduce their purchases under contracts, exercise their right to terminate contracts, or not exercise options to renew contracts, any of which could cause us to lose revenue. A significant decline in overall government spending or a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support could cause a material decline in our revenues and harm our financial results.\nWe depend on a small number of manufacturers for some of our aircraft components.\nWe rely on more than 200 supplier business units or locations for significant or critical components. A small number of manufacturers make some of the key components for our aircraft, and in some instances there is only a single manufacturer,\nalthough other manufacturers could be used if necessary for all of our components. If these manufacturers experience production delays, or if the cost of components increases, our operations could suffer. If a manufacturer ceases production of a required component, we could incur significant costs in purchasing the right to manufacture those components or in developing and certifying a suitable replacement, and in manufacturing those components.\nOur failure to develop new technologies, and to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur ability to grow depends in part on our development of new products or applications. Competitors may develop similar applications for their aircraft, which would increase our competition in providing aerial services. Not all of our products and applications have been, or may be, patented or otherwise legally protected. We rely upon intellectual property law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, clients, consultants, partners, and others to protect our new and existing intellectual property rights. If we are not able to adequately protect the inventions and intellectual property we have developed, in the U.S. and in foreign countries, or if any of our trade secrets, know-how, or other technologies were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nWe purchase products from and supply products to businesses located outside of the U.S. We also have significant operations outside the U.S. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, which can reduce our revenues for transactions denominated in non-U.S. currency or make our services relatively more expensive if denominated in U.S. currency;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances, government or financial instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, and the imposition of taxes or other charges by government authorities;\n\u2022\nsignificant receivables from international customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with transporting our aircraft, including risks associated with piracy and adverse weather;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding required approvals or legal structures necessary to operate aircraft or provide our products and services in a given jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory structures or trade policies;\n\u2022\ntariff and tax regulations including permanent establishment determinations by foreign governments;\n\u2022\ncompliance with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining export and import licenses; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of government-financed competition.\nWhile we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we may not be successful and any measures we take may not be adequate or the regions in which we operate may not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.\nWe are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.\nThe aerial services business is heavily regulated by the FAA in the U.S. and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. The FAA regulates the general operation of our aircraft, the process by which our aircraft are maintained, the components and systems that are installed in our aircraft, the qualification of our flight crews and maintenance personnel, and the specialized operations that we undertake. Our aircraft manufacturing and MRO operations are also subject to regulation by the FAA and other governmental authorities. The FAA regulates the design and manufacture of aircraft and aircraft systems and components. It also sets and enforces standards for the repair of aircraft, systems, and components and for the qualification of personnel performing these functions. Our operations in other countries are similarly regulated under equivalent local laws and regulations, which could change at any time. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nEnvironmental regulation and legal proceedings could lead to significant costs and liability.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including environmental and health and safety regulations. Because our operations are inherently hazardous, compliance with these regulations is challenging and requires constant attention and focus. We are subject to federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, hazardous material and waste management, and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Our failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties administered by the agencies responsible for environmental and safety compliance.\nIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.\nSome of our services are sold under U.S. or foreign government contracts or subcontracts, which typically require a competitive bid process. Government contracts generally are terminable at any time for the convenience of the government. From time to time, we are also subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in government programs. Violation of applicable government rules and regulations could result in civil liability, the cancellation or suspension of existing contracts, or the ineligibility for future contracts or subcontracts funded in whole or in part with federal funds, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNot being classified as a small business may adversely affect our ability to compete for some government contracts.\nThe North American Industry Classification Systems (\u201cNAICS\u201d) maintains industry and product specific codes that are utilized by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a basis for its size standards applicable to Federal government procurements. Businesses that meet the small business size standard for the relevant NAICS code are able to bid on small business set-aside contracts. Several of our contracts provide for differentiating factors in their award process which include small business status, performance records, safety records, and other factors. Several of these factors have been instrumental in us winning new work and continuing contracts. We do not currently qualify as a small business and it is possible that we may not be classified as a small business in the future. Not being classified as a small business may adversely impact our eligibility for special small business programs and limit our ability to partner with other business entities that seek to team with small business entities as may be required under a specific contract.\nProduct liability and product warranty risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe manufacture, repair, and overhaul complex aircraft and critical parts for aircraft. Failure of our aircraft or parts could give rise to substantial product liability and other damage claims. We maintain insurance to address this risk, but our insurance coverage may not be adequate for some claims and there is no guarantee that insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Additionally, aircraft and parts we manufacture for sale are subject to strict contractually established specifications using complex manufacturing processes. If we fail to meet the contractual requirements for a part, we may be subject to warranty costs to repair or replace the part itself and additional costs related to the investigation and inspection of non-complying parts. These costs are generally not insured.\nFuel shortages or fluctuations in the price of fuel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur aerial operations depend on the use of jet fuel. Fuel costs have historically been subject to wide price fluctuations, and fuel availability is subject to shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products. Fuel shortages and increases in the price of fuel, or decreases in the price of fuel when we have entered into hedging agreements, could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to coordinate our business across our global operation bases; and to communicate within our company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. These information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, cyber attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our\nbusiness continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber attacks could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, and data loss and corruption.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increases the compliance risks associated with our international activities.\nOur international operations could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties at their disposal to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws, the FCPA, and other federal statutes. Under trading sanctions laws, the government may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and could subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us.\nOur pilots and maintenance and manufacturing personnel are highly trained and qualified. Our ability to attract and retain qualified pilots, mechanics, and other highly trained personnel will be an important factor in determining our future success. Our aircraft, and the aerial services we provide, require pilots with high levels of flight experience. The market for these experienced and highly trained personnel is extremely competitive. Some of our pilots and mechanics are members of the U.S. military reserves and could be called to active duty. If significant numbers of such persons were called to active duty, it would reduce the supply of such workers, possibly curtailing our operations and likely increasing our labor costs. Because of our small size relative to many of our competitors, we may be unable to attract qualified personnel as easily as our competitors.\nWe have a significant stockholder whose interests may not coincide with other stockholders.\nEntities affiliated with ZM Equity Partners, LLC owns a majority of our outstanding common stock, and one of our directors is a managing director of Centre Lane Partners, LLC, an affiliate of ZM Equity Partners, LLC. These stockholders could exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 13373, "SIC": 7350, "TIC": "EACIQ"}
