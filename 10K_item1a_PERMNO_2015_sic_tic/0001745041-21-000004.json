{"cik": "1745041", "company": "IAA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our Company. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to IAA\u2019s business, risks related to the separation and risks related to IAA\u2019s common stock. However, these risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Effects of COVID-19 and Other Potential Future Health Crises\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic and pandemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 illness. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to reduce its spread has, and may continue to, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely impact worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemic poses the risk that we or our employees, suppliers, subhaulers and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected and in which we operate have disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply of salvage vehicles. For example, due to stay-at-home orders executed in mid-March and other mandates implemented by federal, state and local governments, miles driven declined significantly and reduced the supply of salvage vehicle assignments. This decline in volume significantly impacted our business in fiscal 2020. Even with gradual improvement in miles driven and vehicle assignments in the second half of 2020, miles driven remain lower than pre-COVID levels. If the stabilization in miles driven and assignments is not achieved and sustained, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions and could impact our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, although our operations have been deemed \u201cessential,\u201d we took a series of actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, including, but not limited to, a temporary reduction in branch labor hours across most locations that generally lasted through September 2020, temporarily requiring employees to work remotely where possible, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect our business. In the future, we may take further temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees.\nThe further spread of COVID-19 and actions taken to limit and combat the spread will impact our ability to carry out our business as normal, and may materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact, resurgences of COVID-19 or variants thereof that may continue to occur, the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, any delays or complications in vaccine production and distribution, the efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume.\nRisks Related to Supply, Demand and Competition\nOur business and operating results would be adversely affected due to: loss of one or more significant suppliers, reduction in significant volume from suppliers, an adverse change in our supplier relationships, or a disruption to our supply of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles.\nOur business depends on suppliers of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles. Approximately one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers. Our vehicle suppliers include insurance companies, used-vehicle dealers, rental car and fleet lease companies, auto lenders and charitable organizations, among others. We have established long-term relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies. During fiscal 2020, approximately 40% of our revenues were associated with vehicles supplied by our three largest insurance customers in the United States segment. Our agreements with insurance company suppliers are generally subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled or that we will be able to enter into future agreements on favorable terms with these suppliers. We work to develop strong relationships with our suppliers to better understand their needs. If we\nlose one or more of our significant suppliers, or if one or more of our large suppliers were to significantly reduce volume for any reason or favor competitors or new entrants, we may not be successful in replacing such business and our profitability and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nGenerally, institutional and dealer suppliers make non-binding long-term commitments to us regarding consignment volumes. Changes in the consignment patterns of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. There are many factors that can adversely affect volume from suppliers, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: a decrease in the number of vehicles in operation or miles driven; mild weather conditions that cause fewer traffic accidents; reduction of policy writing by insurance providers that would affect the number of claims over a period of time; increases in fuel prices that could lead to a reduction in the miles driven per vehicle, which may reduce the accident rate; changes in vehicle technology, an increase in autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS); a decrease in the percentage of claims resulting in a total loss or elimination of automotive collision coverage by consumers; delays or changes in state title processing; government regulations on the standards for producing vehicles; and changes in direct repair procedures that would reduce the number of newer, less damaged total loss vehicles, which tend to have higher salvage values. Furthermore, in periods when the supply of vehicles from the insurance sector declines, salvage operators have acquired and in the future may acquire vehicles on their own. Also, when used vehicle prices are high, used-vehicle dealers may retail more of their trade-in vehicles on their own rather than selling them at auction. If the supply or value of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles coming to auction declines significantly, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to meet or exceed our buyer customers\u2019 demand and expectations or due to a disruption in demand of damaged, total loss and low-value vehicles.\nWe believe our future success depends in part on our ability to respond to changes in buyer requirements and our ability to meet regulatory requirements for such customers. Our buyer customers include automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers, and the general public, among others. We work to develop strong relationships and interactive dialogue with our customers to better understand current trends and customer needs. If we are not successful in meeting our customers\u2019 expectations, our customer relationships could be negatively affected and result in a loss of future business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur market position and competitive advantage could be threatened by our competitors and/or disruptive new entrants.\nWe face significant competition for the supply of damaged and total loss vehicles and the buyers of those vehicles. Our principal sources of competition historically have come from (1) direct competitors (e.g., Copart, Inc. and Total Resource Auctions, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc.), (2) new entrants, including new vehicle remarketing venues, and (3) existing alternative vehicle remarketing venues, including used-vehicle auctions and certain salvage buyer groups. Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as marketing and distribution channels, we may face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail marketplaces (generally without any meaningful physical presence) and from our own customers, including insurance companies, when they sell directly to end users through such platforms rather than remarket vehicles through our marketplaces. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in customer requirements and new technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies. Our ability to successfully grow through investments in the area of emerging opportunities depends on many factors, including advancements in technology, regulatory changes and other factors that are difficult to predict, or that may significantly affect the future of electrification, autonomy, and mobility. If we are unable to compete successfully or to successfully adapt to industry changes, our business, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nAlso, see \"The separation and distribution agreement (the \"Separation Agreement\") that we entered into with KAR limits our ability to compete in certain markets for a period of time following the Separation, and in certain instances, requires that we make revenue and profit sharing payments to KAR related to specific customer segments.\"\nIf our facilities lack the capacity to accept additional vehicles, then our relationships with insurance companies or other vehicle suppliers could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly evaluate our capacity in all of our markets and, where appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and facilities. Capacity at our facilities varies from period to period and by region as a result of\nvarious factors, including natural disasters. We may not be able to reach agreements to purchase or lease storage facilities in markets where we have limited available capacity, and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. If we fail to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our facilities, our relationships with insurance companies or other vehicle suppliers could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe may be unable to keep existing facilities or open new facilities in desirable locations and on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nLocal land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of our operations. The majority of our salvage auction vehicle facilities are leased. The termination or expiration of leases at existing facilities may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close the facilities. If we determine to close a location, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the remaining lease term and may have to expense the unamortized portion of the right-of-use assets, in part or in full, as an impairment which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Also, if we are unable to maintain our existing facilities or open new facilities in desirable locations and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, in an increasing number of markets where we experience significant capacity constraints together with pressing customer demand and a lack of viable alternatives for expansion due to zoning and land use restrictions, we may be required to purchase, lease or occupy industrial sites which may contain significant environmental impacts.\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or we may improperly align new strategies with our vision, which could lead to the misapplication of our resources.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition depend on our ability to execute our business strategy. See \"Our Strategy\" under \"Item 1. Business\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether or when we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives, and even if we do succeed, our strategy may not have the favorable impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition that we anticipate. Additionally, our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\nWe may not properly leverage or make the appropriate investment in technology advancements, which could result in the loss of any sustainable competitive advantage in products, services and processes.\nOur business is dependent on information technology. Robust information technology systems, platforms and products are critical to our operating environment, digital online products and competitive position. Rapid technology changes may render our technology obsolete and understanding technology innovation is necessary to remain at the forefront of our industry. We may not be successful in structuring our information technology or developing, acquiring or implementing information systems that are competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers. We might lack sufficient resources to continue to make the significant investments in information technology to compete with our competitors. Certain information technology initiatives that management considers important to our long-term success will require capital investment, have significant risks associated with their execution, and could take several years to implement. If we are unable to develop/implement these initiatives in a cost-effective, timely manner or at all, it could damage our relationships with our customers and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, our operating results, financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions are a part of our growth strategy and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our service offerings. Our strategy generally involves acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies to expand our online, digital and mobile capabilities and the acquisition and integration of additional auction sites and personnel. Acquisition of businesses requires substantial time and attention of management personnel and may also require additional equity or debt financings. Further, integration of acquired businesses is often disruptive. There can be no assurance that we will identify appropriate targets, will acquire such businesses on favorable terms, or will be able to successfully integrate such organizations into our business. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions\nmay also have unanticipated tax, legal, regulatory and accounting ramifications, including as a result of recording goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges. In addition, we expect to compete against other auction groups or new industry consolidators for suitable acquisitions. If we are able to consummate acquisitions, such acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, and we could overpay for such acquisitions.\nIn pursuing a strategy of acquiring other businesses, we face other risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022incurring significantly higher capital expenditures, operating expenses and operating losses of the business acquired;\n\u2022entering new markets with which we are unfamiliar;\n\u2022incurring potential undiscovered liabilities at acquired businesses;\n\u2022failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;\n\u2022incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of management changes; and\n\u2022increasing expenses for accounting and computer systems, as well as integration difficulties.\nReliance on our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe rely on independent subhaulers and trucking fleet operations to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our auction facilities. Failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely manner could harm our brand and reputation, and impact the overall business. Further, an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers and trucking fleet operators, which may significantly increase our cost. We may not be able to pass these costs on to our suppliers or buyers. We are also exposed to risks associated with inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure and increase in the price of fuel, any of which could increase our operating costs. If we experience problems or are unable to negotiate or obtain favorable terms with our subhaulers, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAn increase in the number of damaged and total loss vehicles we purchase could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn certain countries, the salvage market typically operates on a principal basis, in which a vehicle is purchased and then resold, rather than on an agent basis, in which the auction acts as a sales agent for the owner of the vehicle. Operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks, including losses from theft, damage and obsolescence. If we purchase vehicles, the increased costs associated with acquiring the vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit margin and operating results. Vehicles sold under purchase agreements were approximately 5% of our vehicles sold both domestically and internationally for fiscal 2020. In addition, when vehicles are purchased, we are subject to changes in vehicle values, such as those caused by changes in commodity prices. Decreases in commodity prices, such as steel and platinum, may negatively affect vehicle values and demand at auctions.\nA significant change in used-vehicle prices could impact the proceeds and revenue from the sale of damaged and total loss vehicles.\nThe volume of new vehicle production, accuracy of lease residual estimates, interest rate fluctuations, customer demand and changes in regulations, among other things, all potentially affect the pricing of used vehicles. A sustained reduction in used-vehicle pricing could result in lower proceeds from the sale of damaged and total loss vehicles and a related reduction in revenue per vehicle, a potential loss of consignors and decreased profitability.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses.\nWe self-insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program, as well as a portion of our automobile, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims. We record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits, automobile, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims. If actual trends, including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation above expectations were to occur, our self-insured costs would increase, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Current accounting standards require that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill represents a significant percentage of our total assets. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction in net income.\nWe assume the settlement risk for vehicles sold through our marketplaces.\nTypically, following the sale of a vehicle, we do not release the vehicle to a buyer until such time as we have received full payment for the vehicle. We may be obligated, however, to remit payment to a seller before receiving payment from a buyer and in those circumstances, we may not have recourse against sellers for any buyer\u2019s failure to satisfy its payment obligations. Because we retain possession of the vehicle, we can resell the vehicle to mitigate any potential losses. Since revenue for most vehicles does not include the gross sales proceeds, failure to collect the receivables in full may result in a net loss up to the amount of gross sales proceeds on a per vehicle basis in addition to any expenses incurred to collect the receivables and to provide the services associated with the vehicle. If we are unable to collect payments on a large number of vehicles and we are unable to resell them and recover our costs, the resulting payment obligations to the seller and decreased fee revenues may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Data and Cyber Security\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, infrastructure and business information could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur business involves the receipt and storage of information about our customers and employees and maintaining internal business data. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes and activities. The secure operation of these systems, and the processing, maintenance and storage of the information processed by these systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology risks (including the confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital assets) for companies have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or our employees, or may result from human error, accidental technological failure or physical break-ins. In addition, our technology infrastructure, information systems, and data storage facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, physical break-ins, power loss and telecommunications failures. Although we have technology and information security processes and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate our risks to these vulnerabilities, these measures may not be adequate to ensure that our operations will not be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of any of these events. Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital online products as well as other information technologies, computers, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, our customers increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access our online products and services and the security of these third party devices may be beyond our control. Any significant disruptions of our information technology systems or the theft of information from our data storage facilities could negatively impact our business, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nData security concerns relating to our technology or breaches of information technology systems, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit, and store electronic information. We have experienced cyber attacks and security breaches of varying degrees to our information technology infrastructure and systems and we believe we will continue to be a potential target of such threats and attacks, resulting in unauthorized access to our computer systems and networks, including our cloud-based platforms. The technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers, vendors, service providers, cloud solution providers and partners have also in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks. Cyber attacks can include computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders\nwith access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage. We believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems, but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities.\nContinuous cyber attacks or a sustained attack could lead to service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the information technology that supports our business and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added systems), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. Continuous cyber-attacks could also lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies, or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. If such attacks are not detected in a timely manner, their effects could be compounded.\nAlthough we have technology and information security processes and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate our risks to these vulnerabilities, these measures may not be adequate to ensure that our operations will not be significantly compromised or disrupted upon the occurrence of any such events. If our information technology is compromised, becomes inoperable for extended periods of time or ceases to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace the information technology and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position. In some instances, efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent attacks may reduce the performance of our computer systems and networks, which could negatively impact our business. In addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology of third party partners to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers. A compromise or breach of our own or our third party systems used to protect customer transaction data, whether due to viruses transmitted via the Internet and other points of access, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, or defective design, could cause a service disruption. We maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks. Despite these mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses in the future. Under current credit card practices, we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers. As such, we have implemented certain anti-fraud measures, including credit card verification procedures and limiting the acceptance of credit cards from certain newly acquired customers. However, a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nCompliance with U.S. and global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and store data, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nWe collect and store sensitive and confidential data, including the intellectual property, proprietary business information, proprietary business information of our customers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy regulation in the United States, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), and privacy regulations elsewhere around the globe, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d). The CCPA, which came into effect beginning in January 2020, imposes new notice and privacy policy requirements, and new obligations to respond to requests to know and access to personal information, to delete personal information and to say no to the sale of personal information, which may impose significant costs on us. The GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States, enhances enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater.\nIn addition, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons, and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy, and security of such data are possible. In the U.S., state laws provide for disparate notification regimes. If our practices or products are deemed to be an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, we may be subject to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense, and loss of revenue.\nThese laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations in the various states or in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs or restrictions on us, result in significant loss of revenue, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could also result in significant liability to us, including liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation, or may result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. Our operations could also be negatively affected by changes to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our customers and us. These changes may limit the manner in which we conduct our business or otherwise may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues, earnings, and cash flows. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative impact on our customers, we may experience customer losses or increased operating costs, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nChanges in laws affecting the import and export of damaged and total loss vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur Internet-based auction services have allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and have increased our international buyer base. As a result, foreign buyers of damaged and total loss vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base. Changes in laws, regulations and treaties that restrict the importation of damaged and total loss vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for damaged and total loss vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base. The adoption of such laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing the demand for our products and services.\nWe are subject to certain governmental regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial and local authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications and provide certain disclosures and notices. See Item 1. Business - Government Regulation for additional information.\nChanges in law or governmental regulations or interpretations of existing law or regulations could result in increased costs, reduced vehicle prices and decreased profitability for us. In addition, failure to comply with present or future laws and regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or in their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are also subject from time to time to a variety of legal actions relating to our current and past business operations, including litigation relating to employment-related issues, the environment and personal injury claims. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in legal and administrative actions or in asserting our rights under various laws. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or in asserting our rights in such actions. The costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we currently believe that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected.\nEnvironmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions.\nSome of the facilities on which we operate are impacted by significant recognized environmental concerns and pollution conditions. We have incurred and may in the future incur expenditures relating to compliance and risk mitigation efforts, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant. Federal and state environmental authorities\nare currently investigating our role in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington. Our potential liability at this site cannot be estimated at this time. See \"Business-Legal Proceedings.\"\nRisks Related to International Operations\nOur expansion into markets outside the U.S. and our non-U.S. based operations subject us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks.\nAcquisitions and other strategies to expand our operations beyond North America subject us to additional significant risks and uncertainties. As we continue to explore opportunities to expand our business internationally, we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale. There can be no assurance that we will identify appropriate international targets, acquire such businesses on favorable terms, or be able to successfully grow and integrate such organizations into our business. Operationally, acquired businesses typically depend on key relationships and our failure to develop or maintain those relationships could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we anticipate that our non-U.S.-based operations will continue to subject us to risks associated with operating on an international basis, including:\n\u2022exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability;\n\u2022exposure to the principal or purchase auction model rather than the agency or consignment model, which may have an adverse impact on our margins and expose us to inventory risks;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to repatriate funds, as well as repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions, which may result in higher effective tax rates;\n\u2022tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022compliance with the various privacy regulations, including the GDPR;\n\u2022dealing with unfamiliar regulatory agencies and laws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022dealing with political and/or economic instability;\n\u2022the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices, as well as the increased travel, infrastructure, legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022localizing our product offerings; and\n\u2022adapting to different business cultures and market structures.\nAs we continue to explore opportunities to expand globally, our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with operating on an international basis. Our failure to manage these risks could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nA portion of our net income is derived from our international operations, primarily Canada, which exposes us to foreign exchange risks that may impact our financial statements. In addition, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies may negatively impact foreign buyer participation in our marketplaces.\nFluctuations between U.S. and foreign currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from our foreign subsidiaries. Approximately 12% of our revenues were attributable to our foreign operations for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2020. Changes in the value of foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, could negatively affect our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. A 10% change in the average Canadian exchange rate for the twelve months ended December 27, 2020 would have impacted net income by approximately $1.8 million.\nIn addition, fluctuations in exchange rates may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. For purposes of accounting, the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using period-end exchange rates; such translation gains and losses are reported in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income/loss\" as a component of stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity. The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period.\nLikewise, we have a significant number of non-U.S.-based buyers who participate in our marketplaces. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these buyers\u2019 local currencies may reduce the prices they are willing to pay at auction, which may negatively affect our revenues.\nRisks Related to Our Separation and Distribution\nThe separation and distribution agreement (the \"Separation Agreement\") that we entered into with KAR limits our ability to compete in certain markets for a period of time following the Separation, and in certain instances, requires that we make revenue and profit sharing payments to KAR related to specific customer segments.\nPrior to the Separation, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of KAR. Accordingly, KAR possessed and exercised sole and absolute discretion to determine and change the terms of the Separation Agreement. The Separation Agreement contains a covenant not to compete, prohibiting us and our affiliates from engaging in certain non-salvage activities in competition with KAR\u2019s business for a period of five years following the Separation in certain jurisdictions, subject to certain exceptions. We are expressly permitted to continue to conduct our salvage auction business as conducted immediately prior to the Separation. The exceptions also permit us to conduct certain non-salvage business, in some cases subject to a revenue sharing mechanic in the event such business exceeds specified volume limits or other thresholds. These restrictions may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and could materially and adversely affect our business, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince the Separation, we also face competition from ADESA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of KAR (\"ADESA\"), for some of the services that we provide, and the Separation Agreement limits our ability to compete in certain markets for a period of time.\nIf the Separation and Distribution fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then IAA, KAR and KAR\u2019s stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.\nKAR received an IRS Ruling on certain issues relevant to the qualification of the Separation and Distribution as tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, based on certain facts and representations. The IRS Ruling does not address all of the requirements for tax-free treatment of the Separation and Distribution.\nAs a condition to the Distribution KAR received an opinion from its U.S. tax counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, on the basis of certain facts, representations, covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinion, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Separation and Distribution, taken together, qualifies as a transaction that generally is tax-free to KAR and KAR\u2019s stockholders, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. Notwithstanding the tax opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or covenants set forth in the tax opinion is not correct or has been violated, or that the Distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion. If the Distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the Distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and you could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liability. In addition, KAR and/or we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the tax matters agreement that we entered into with KAR, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions were undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with KAR.\nThe agreements we entered into with KAR in connection with the Separation and Distribution, including the Separation Agreement and the ancillary agreements, were prepared in the context of IAA\u2019s separation from KAR while IAA was still a wholly-owned subsidiary of KAR. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, IAA did not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of KAR and KAR possessed and exercised sole and absolute discretion in determining the terms of the agreements. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. We may have received better terms from third parties because, among other things, third parties may have competed with each other to win our business.\nWe may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the Separation.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to KAR of the Separation and the Distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with KAR, we are restricted from taking certain actions that would prevent the distribution and related transactions\nfrom being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such restrictions are applicable to us during the two-year period following the distribution and may prohibit us, except in certain circumstances, from, among other things:\n\u2022entering into any transaction whereby we merge or consolidate with any other person or entity as a result of which one or more persons or entities would, directly or indirectly, acquire a significant portion of our stock or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022merging, consolidating, or liquidating;\n\u2022issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022repurchasing certain amounts of our capital stock; or\n\u2022ceasing to actively conduct our business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we are required to indemnify KAR against liabilities resulting from certain actions taken after the distribution that cause the Distribution to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe will be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to KAR or we may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from KAR.\nUnder the terms of the Separation and Distribution, we are required to indemnify KAR from and with respect to (i) all debts, liabilities and obligations allocated or transferred to us in connection with the Separation and Distribution (including our failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such debts, liabilities or obligations after the Separation and Distribution), (ii) any breach by us of the Separation Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements, and (iii) any misstatement or omission of a material fact in our Registration Statement on Form 10. We are not aware of any existing indemnification obligations at this time, but any such indemnification obligations that may arise could be significant. Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, KAR is required to indemnify us from and after the Separation and Distribution with respect to (i) all debts, liabilities and obligations allocated to KAR after the Separation and Distribution (including its failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such debts, liabilities or obligations after the separation and distribution) and (ii) any breach by KAR of the Separation Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements. Our and KAR\u2019s ability to satisfy these indemnities, if called upon to do so, will depend respectively upon our and KAR\u2019s future financial strength. If we are required to indemnify KAR, or if we are not able to collect on indemnification rights from KAR, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot determine whether we will have to indemnify KAR, or if KAR will have to indemnify us, for any substantial obligations after the Distribution.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure and Organization\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business.\nAs of December 27, 2020, our total corporate debt was $1.3 billion. Our indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt-service requirements, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on debt, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes, including funding future expansion;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult to react quickly to, changing conditions; and\n\u2022exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because the majority of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt and meet other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our indebtedness. If we must sell certain of our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. The inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we would be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that may be considered to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or other corporate transaction that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interest, including those transactions that might result in payment of a premium over the market price for our stock.\nThese provisions include:\n\u2022rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022permitting our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022granting to the Board, and not the stockholders, the sole power to set the number of directors;\n\u2022the initial division of our Board into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered term;\n\u2022a provision that directors serving on a classified Board may be removed by stockholders only for cause;\n\u2022authorizing vacancies on our Board to be filled only by a vote of the majority of the directors then in office and specifically denying our stockholders the right to fill vacancies in the Board; and\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent.\nThese provisions apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and the provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nWe are not subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \"DGCL\"). Section 203 of the DGCL provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, we would be required to indemnify KAR for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain exclusive forum provisions that could limit an IAA stockholder\u2019s ability to choose a judicial forum that it finds favorable for certain disputes with IAA or its directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents, and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the Board otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of IAA, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of IAA to IAA or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against IAA or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of IAA arising out of or relating to any provision of the DGCL or IAA\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against IAA or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of IAA governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant. The exclusive forum provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such disputes and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions\ninapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. Also, we may be subject to patent or other intellectual property infringement claims, which could have an impact on our business or operating results due to a disruption in our business operations, the incurrence of significant costs and other factors.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nFrom time to time, we may receive notices from others claiming that we infringed or otherwise violated their patent or intellectual property rights, and the number of these claims could increase in the future. Claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property violations could require us to enter into licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change business practices and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. If we are required to take any of these actions, it could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, or have inadequate succession planning, we may not be able to execute our business strategies and our financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends in large part on the performance of our senior executive team and other key employees, including key field and information technology personnel. If we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete with us, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategies, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Our auction business is directly impacted by the business relationships our employees have established with customers and suppliers and, as a result, if we lose key personnel, we may have difficulty in retaining and attracting customers, developing new services, negotiating favorable agreements with customers and providing acceptable levels of customer service. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We do not have nor do we currently expect to obtain key person insurance on any of our executive officers.\nWeather-related and other events beyond our control may adversely impact operations.\nExtreme weather or other events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, forest fires, floods, global pandemics or other health crises, terrorist attacks or war, may adversely affect the overall economic environment, the markets in which we compete, and our operations and profitability. These events may impact our physical auction facilities, causing a material increase in costs, or delays or cancellation of auction sales, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. In some instances, for example with the severe storm in August 2017 known as \"Hurricane Harvey,\" these events may result in a sharp influx in the available supply of damaged and total loss vehicles and there can be no assurance that our business will have sufficient resources to handle such extreme increases in supply. Our failure to meet our customers\u2019 demands in such situations could negatively affect our relationships with such customers and result in a loss of future business, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, revenues generated as a result of the total loss\nof vehicles associated with such a catastrophe are typically recognized subsequent to the incurrence of incremental costs and such revenues may not be sufficient to offset the costs incurred.\nMild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of damaged and total loss vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer vehicles are damaged. Accordingly, mild weather can have an adverse effect on our damaged and total loss vehicle inventories, which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates.", "PERMNO": 18736, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "IAA"}
