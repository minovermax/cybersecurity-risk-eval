Risk Factors\nCautionary Statements\nThe following discussion, as well as other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regarding our business, financial condition and results of operations. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical information provided or incorporated by reference herein, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, statements including the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d\n\u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cfeels,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by the forward-looking information and statements due to, among other things, health care reform and other increased government participation in and taxation or regulation of health benefits and managed care operations, including but not limited to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \"ACA\") and related fees, assessments and taxes; our ability to successfully participate in California\u2019s Coordinated Care Initiative, which is subject to a number of risks inherent in untested health care initiatives and requires us to adequately predict the costs of providing benefits to individuals that are generally among the most chronically ill within each of Medicare and Medi-Cal and implement delivery systems for benefits with which we have limited operating experience; our ability to successfully participate in the federal and state health insurance exchanges under the ACA, which involve uncertainties related to the mix and volume of business that could negatively impact the adequacy of our premium rates and may not be sufficiently offset by the risk apportionment provisions of the ACA; increasing health care costs, including but not limited to costs associated with the introduction of new treatments or therapies; our ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance, including through our master services agreement with a subsidiary of Cognizant; whether we receive required regulatory approvals for Cognizant\u2019s provision of services to us and any conditions imposed in order to obtain such regulatory approvals; our ability to recognize the intended cost savings and other intended benefits of the Cognizant transaction; the risk that Cognizant may not perform contracted functions and services in a timely, satisfactory and compliant manner; negative prior period claims reserve developments; rate cuts and other risks and uncertainties affecting our Medicare or Medicaid businesses; trends in medical care ratios; membership declines or negative changes in our health care product mix; unexpected utilization patterns or unexpectedly severe or widespread illnesses; failure to effectively oversee our third-party vendors; noncompliance by our or our business associates with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; the timing of collections on amounts receivable from state and federal governments and agencies; litigation costs; regulatory issues with federal and state agencies including, but not limited to, the California Department of Managed Health Care and Department of Health Care Services, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state departments of insurance; operational issues; changes in economic or market conditions; investment portfolio impairment charges; volatility in the financial markets; and general business and market conditions.\nAdditional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks set forth below, and the other risks discussed in our other filings with the SEC.\nAny or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many of the factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. These factors should be considered in conjunction with any discussion of operations or results by us or our representatives, including any forward-looking discussion, as well as information contained in press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors or other communications by us. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis, judgment, belief or expectation only as of the date thereof and are subject to changes in circumstances and a number of risks and uncertainties. Except as may be required by law, we do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements.\nFederal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on the costs of operating our business and a failure to successfully execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect thereto could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ACA transformed the U.S. health care system through a series of complex initiatives. While we have experienced significant growth in our revenues and membership in certain products as a result of the ACA, the measures initiated by the ACA and the associated preparation for and implementation of these measures have had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on, among other things, the costs of operating our business, and could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Due in part to the magnitude, scope and complexity of these initiatives, as well as the continuing uncertainties related to their ongoing implementation and evolution, the ultimate impact of the ACA on us remains difficult to predict.\nThe ACA imposes significant fees, assessments and taxes on us and other health insurers, health plans and industry participants. Among others, the ACA imposes a significant non-deductible tax (technically called a \u201cfee\u201d) on\nhealth insurers, effective for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2013. In 2014, this \u201chealth insurer fee\u201d was assessed at a total of $8 billion nationwide. In 2015, it is expected to be assessed at a total of $11.3 billion nationwide in 2015 and will increase annually thereafter. The health insurer fee will be allocated pro rata amongst industry participants based on a ratio of net health insurance premiums written for the previous calendar year to total net premiums written for the U.S. health insurance industry, subject to certain exceptions and adjustments. In September 2014, we paid the federal government a lump sum of $141.4 million for our portion of the health insurer fee based on 2013 net premiums written. We currently estimate that our allocable share of the health insurer fee payable in 2015, based upon 2014 premiums, will be approximately $230 million. However, this estimate is subject to inherent uncertainty as the amount of industry premiums upon which the fee allocation is based has not been announced and the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) is not expected to provide additional information on the 2014 health insurer fee until June 2015. While we are required to accrue for the health insurer fee on a pro rata basis throughout the year, in future years, we could experience significant volatility in our cash flow from operations relative to our results of operations in a given period because the health insurer fee is payable in a single lump sum based on prior year premiums. In 2014, due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee for federal income tax purposes, our full-year effective income tax rate was adversely affected by 24.8 percentage points. In future periods, we expect that the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee will continue to have a material impact on our effective income tax rate.\nIn addition, while certain types of entities and benefits are fully or partially exempt from the health insurer fee, including, among others, government entities, certain non-profit insurers and self-funded plans, we are unable to take advantage of any significant exemptions due to our current mix of plans and product offerings. Consequently, the health insurer fee has represented and will continue to represent a higher percentage of our premium revenues than those of our competitors who have business lines that are exempt from the health insurer fee or whose non-profit status may result in a reduced health insurer fee. Moreover, some of our competitors may have greater economies of scale or a different mix of business, which, among other things, may lead to lower expense ratios and higher profit margins than we have. Since the health insurer fee is not tax deductible and is based on net health insurance premiums written, rather than profits, it generally also will represent a higher percentage of our profits as compared to those competitors. We generally will be unable to match those competitors\u2019 ability to support reduced premiums by virtue of making changes to distribution arrangements, decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services, or otherwise adjusting operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses. As a result, the health insurer fee may adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete.\nAs a whole, the ACA\u2019s fees, assessments and taxes will increase the costs of operating our business and could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, while the ACA does also present significant new business opportunities for us, we and other health insurance companies continue to face uncertainty and execution risk due to the multiple, complex ACA implementations that were and continue to be required in abbreviated time frames in new markets. Additionally, in many cases, our operational and strategic initiatives are being implemented in evolving regulatory environments and without the benefit of established market data. While we were able to implement several strategic and operational ACA initiatives during 2014, the relative lack of operating experience in these new marketplaces for insurers and, in certain cases, providers and consumers, has fostered a dynamic marketplace that requires us to continuously adjust our operating and strategic initiatives over time, particularly in these first few years of the ACA. There is no assurance that insurers, including us, will be able to successfully make these adjustments on an ongoing basis. Our execution risk encapsulates, among other things, our simultaneous participation in the exchanges, Medicaid expansion and California\u2019s Coordinated Care Initiative (\u201cCCI\u201d), as further described in \"Item 1. Business-Segment Information-Western Region Operations Segment-California Coordinated Care Initiative.\u201d These initiatives involved the incorporation of new and expanded populations and, among other things, have required that we restructure our provider network in response, and will require us to remain diligent in monitoring the market to, among other things, effectively and efficiently adapt to the ACA\u2019s dynamic environment. Any delay or failure by us to successfully execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to health care reform or otherwise appropriately react to changes to the legislation, implementing regulations, actions of our competitors and the changing marketplace could result in operational disruptions, disputes with our providers or members, increased exposure to litigation, regulatory issues, damage to our existing or potential member relationships or other adverse consequences that may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe ACA has been the subject of various legal challenges and legislative initiatives, which increase the uncertainty of how the law will impact us.\nThere are numerous steps required to implement the ACA, and although many significant regulations have been finalized, further amendments to these regulations, additional clarifying regulations and other guidance are expected over several years.\nEven in cases where the federal government has issued final regulations, we and other health insurers continue to face uncertainty because these final regulations are sometimes unclear or incomplete, subject to further change, or rely on sub-regulatory guidance. For example, there is a potential for uncertainty and disruption related to an upcoming change in the definition of \u201csmall employer\u201d for purposes of the types of plans that health insurance issuers can offer to employers. Currently, all of the states in which we operate regulate group health plans with 50 or fewer employees as small group plans. However, beginning in 2016, the ACA redefines the definition of small employer to include plans with up to 100 employees. Federal regulators have announced transitional guidance that will allow groups in the 51-100 size range to renew their current large group plans through plan years beginning on or before Oct. 1, 2016, but it is not clear whether the states in which we operate will adopt this transitional policy. Any uncertainty with regard to the change in definition or how the change will affect new and existing groups with 51-100 employees may lead to uncertainty in our ability to predict costs and set premiums in 2016 and future years.\nIn addition to ongoing regulatory questions, many of the operational components of health care reform are still being developed, including how market participants ultimately interact and adapt to the new requirements within and outside the ACA\u2019s state-run and federally-facilitated health insurance exchanges. Moreover, federal regulators have previously delayed implementation of certain ACA requirements through various extensions, allowances and transition periods, including the requirement that large employers provide coverage to full-time employees or pay a penalty, along with related reporting requirements, and the requirement that federal and state small business health option program exchanges be able to facilitate employee choice among multiple health plans, due to operational concerns impacting both employers and health insurance issuers. The markets impacted by these delays represent a significant portion of our business, including our small group markets, and as a result, we will be implementing certain key ACA related strategic and operational initiatives for the first time in 2015. These delays and developing regulations contribute to lingering uncertainty surrounding the ACA, and the ultimate impact of health care reform on us may not be evident until the ultimate requirements of the ACA have been definitively determined, the various related programs have been fully implemented, and both insurers and regulators are able to make necessary adjustments.\nIn addition, certain legal and legislative challenges to the ACA remain despite the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2012 decision in NFIB v. Sebelius. In Sebelius, the Supreme Court upheld the ACA\u2019s individual mandate as valid under Congress\u2019 taxing power. The Sebelius decision also permits states to opt out of the elements of the ACA that require expansion of Medicaid coverage in January 2014 without losing their existing federal Medicaid funding. Arizona and California have extended coverage to the uninsured through Medicaid expansions; however, the law in Arizona authorizing the expansion has been subject to litigation, and it is not clear when this will be resolved.\nSeveral lawsuits have been brought regarding whether the ACA authorizes the IRS to provide premium tax credits (i.e., federal subsidies) to individuals who purchase coverage through a federally-facilitated exchange (\u201cFFE\u201d), and different federal courts have come to different conclusions on this matter. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear one of these challenges, King v. Burwell. Oral arguments are scheduled for March, 2015, although a final decision from the Supreme Court is not expected until as late as June, 2015. Any significant restriction or prohibition of federal subsidies for coverage obtained through FFEs may impact the affordability of FFE products for low income individuals, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our FFE exchange membership in Arizona, and have an adverse impact on the Arizona individual market risk pool more generally. While such an outcome would most directly impact states with FFEs such as Arizona, the potential uncertainty created by such a ruling may have collateral effects in states with state-based exchanges or on the ACA in general, particularly in light of the newly Republican controlled Congress. For more information on our ACA health insurance exchanges, see the risk factor below under the heading, \u201c-We cannot assure you that our participation in the ACA\u2019s health insurance exchanges will continue to be a success.\u201d Other litigation regarding the implementation of the ACA remains ongoing, including litigation around federal regulations regarding contraception coverage and regarding the ability of HHS to make payments to plans under the ACA\u2019s cost sharing reductions program.\nOn the legislative front, though repeal of the ACA in its entirety remains unlikely, Congress has proposed certain legislative initiatives that may affect certain provisions of the ACA, including initiatives that could repeal or modify the requirement that large employers provide coverage to employees, repeal the individual mandate, delay or repeal the tax on medical devices, delay or repeal the health insurer fee, repeal the risk corridors program and other potential changes.\nCertain initiatives that have been unable to establish momentum in the past, may gain support with the newly Republican controlled Congress.\nCertain of the proposed legislative changes described above, withholding of ACA funding by Congress, extended delays in the issuance of clarifying regulations and other guidance, delays in implementation, legal challenges or other lingering uncertainty regarding the ACA could cause us to incur additional costs of compliance or require us to significantly modify or adjust certain of the operational and strategic initiatives we have already established. Such modifications may result in the loss of some or all of the substantial resources that have been and will be invested in the ACA implementation, require investment of additional resources and, depending on the nature of the modification, could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nVarious health insurance reform proposals continue to emerge at the state level, which could have an adverse impact on us.\nVarious health insurance reform proposals have been considered at the state level, and more are likely to be considered in the future. Many of the states in which we operate have been implementing parts of the ACA and many states have added new requirements that are more exacting than the ACA's requirements. In most cases states can mandate minimum medical loss ratios(\"MLRs\") , implement rate reforms and enact benefit mandates that go beyond provisions included in the ACA. For additional discussion on MLRs and its impact on our business, see \"-We face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices. If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\" In addition, state exchange boards in California have the ability to limit the number of plans and negotiate the price of coverage sold on these exchanges and to limit the service areas in which Qualified Health Plans (\u201cQHPs\u201d) in the exchanges may operate. These kinds of state regulations and legislation could, among other things, limit or delay our ability to increase premiums in future years even where actuarially supported, and thereby could adversely impact our revenues and profitability. This also could increase the competition we face from companies that have lower health care or administrative costs than we do and therefore can price their premiums at lower levels than we can.\nFurther, the interaction of current and new federal regulations and the continuing implementation of federal health care reform by the various states in which we do business will continue to create substantial uncertainty for us and other health insurance companies about the requirements under which we must operate. States may disagree in their interpretations of the federal statute and regulations, and state \u201cguidance\u201d that is issued could be unclear or untimely. In the case of the ACA exchanges, we are required to operate under and comply with the regulatory authority of the federal government in addition to the laws, rules and regulations of each of the states that establish and administer their own exchanges. State exchange standards and processes related to areas such as enrollment, payment, certification standards, and other areas have differed and may differ in the future from those of the federally-facilitated exchanges. In some cases, it may not be clear whether federal or state guidelines apply, and federal and state guidelines may not align perfectly. For example, under current federal guidance, the determination of what constitutes a \u201csmall group\u201d for purposes of determining whether a plan participates in the risk adjustment program may differ from the determination used by states in enforcing compliance with the market reform requirements for small group health plans in some instances. If we do not successfully implement the various state law requirements of the ACA, including with respect to the exchanges, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively incorporate the ACA\u2019s premium stabilization and other related provisions into our business, or these provisions are not successful in mitigating our financial risks, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe ACA also includes premium stabilization provisions designed to apportion risk amongst insurers, including the reinsurance, risk adjustment, and risk corridors programs.\nThe permanent risk adjustment program is applicable to plans in the individual and small group markets that are subject to the ACA\u2019s market reforms. This risk adjustment program became effective at the beginning of 2014 and has and will continue to shape the economics of health care coverage both within and outside the exchanges. These provisions will effectively transfer funds from health plans with relatively lower risk enrollees to plans with relatively higher risk enrollees to help protect against the consequences of adverse selection. The individual and small group markets represent a significant portion of our commercial business and the relevant amounts transferred may be substantial. To adapt to this new economic framework, we have dedicated significant resources and incurred significant costs to implement numerous strategic and operational initiatives both within and outside the exchanges that, among other things, require us to focus on and manage different populations of potential members than we have in the past.\nThe success of these initiatives relies on our ability to achieve an accurate risk adjustment allocation, which in turn depends in large part on our ability to accurately assess our health plans\u2019 risk and incorporate that into the risk adjustment calculus. This calculation relies primarily on encounter data to define a health plan\u2019s average actuarial risk. The process of accurately collecting this data presents disadvantages to more heavily capitated health plans such as ours because providers receiving fixed fees from health insurers may not have the same incentive to provide accurate and complete encounter data with respect to services rendered when compared to providers under fee for service arrangements. This incentive problem may be particularly acute for health plans operating under the delegated HMO model, which is prevalent in our California health plans. Under this model, third party intermediaries assume responsibility for certain utilization management and care coordination responsibilities, including the collection of encounter data. We have been refining our health plan infrastructure and provider network to help ensure that we are accurately capturing this data. However, if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, assuming we accurately capture complete encounter data, there is continued uncertainty about how HHS will validate this risk adjustment data. The \u201cdistributed data collection\u201d approach by which HHS will collect risk adjustment data is still ongoing for 2014 plan data there remains some uncertainty regarding the types of penalties that will be imposed and the criteria for imposing such penalties where an insurer fails to provide sufficient data to HHS. Uncertainty or delay in the data collection process and the evaluation of preliminary risk scores in the context of our competitive market may limit our ability to accurately predict receivables or payables under the program and adversely impact our ability to set premium rates for future periods.\nIn addition to these permanent risk adjustment provisions, the ACA implements temporary reinsurance and risk corridors programs, which seek to ease the transition into the post-ACA market by helping to stabilize rates and protect against rate uncertainty in the initial years of the ACA.\nWe have made and are continuing to make significant efforts to design and implement a cohesive strategy with respect to these premium stabilization programs and the exchanges, but these programs are subject to risks inherent in estimated calculations and untested initiatives and the relevant regulatory framework for the ACA remains subject to change and interpretation over time. Calculating these premium stabilization provisions require us to estimate receivables and payables. Until the final calculations are performed that determine the amounts collectible and payable, the estimates can vary and the final amounts may materially differ from those estimates. The final determination and settlement of amounts due or payable from these premium stabilization provisions for 2014 will not occur until at least June 2015. If we are required to make material adjustments from our prior estimates, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of the operational aspects relating to these premium stabilization programs, as well as related to advanced payments of premium tax credits for exchange plans, such as reporting data to HHS and the calculation of payments and charges, will be operationalized for the first time in 2015, including with respect to the small group market, and the data required and operational procedures for such reporting are still being developed. Any inability by Health Net to obtain and submit complete data for reporting under these premium stabilization or to reconcile our data with CMS or state exchanges as needed, could adversely affect our performance under these programs.\nIn addition, there have been recent legislative and regulatory developments with respect to the risk corridors program. In December of 2014, Congress passed and the President signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (Public Law 113-235), which contained language restricting the ability of HHS to use certain sources of funding to make payments under risk corridors program for 2015. HHS recognizes, in both final regulations and guidance, it is obligated to make the risk corridors program payments without regard to budget neutrality. Although HHS anticipates the program will be budget neutral, the ACA requires HHS to make full payments to those issuers with risk corridors ratios above 103 percent. Additionally, HHS states in final regulations and guidance that if the program\u2019s collections, including any potential carryover from prior years, are insufficient to satisfy its payment obligations, the agency will use other sources of funding to meet its payment obligations, subject to the availability of appropriations. If corridor collections are insufficient in 2014, HHS explains that it shall fulfill its obligations for the 2014 benefit year by using funds collected for the 2015 benefit year prior to making payments on 2015 obligations. The risk corridor receivable balance included in other noncurrent assets as of December 31, 2014 was $90.4 million and the risk corridor payable balance included in other noncurrent liabilities as of December 31, 2014 was $3.6 million. If we experience payment delays that are extended for any significant period of time, it may require us to modify our strategic and operational initiatives with respect to both our on and off exchange products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or liquidity. For additional discussion of the risks associated with participation in programs involving a government payor, see the risk factor below under the heading, \u201c-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs or if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, we may experience a significant reduction in\nrevenues from these government programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\u201d\nWhether due to such regulatory uncertainty or otherwise, if these premium stabilization programs prove ineffective in mitigating our financial risks, including adverse selection risk, or we are unable to successfully adapt our strategy to any future changes in certain of our markets, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For additional information on these premium stabilization programs, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Health Care Reform Legislation and Implementation-Premium Stabilization Programs and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe cannot assure you that our participation in the ACA\u2019s health insurance exchanges will continue to be a success.\nThe ACA required the establishment of state-run or federally facilitated \u201cexchanges\u201d where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage. We currently participate as QHPs in the exchanges in California and Arizona. Our continued participation in the exchanges and future participation in any other exchanges in the states in which we operate is conditioned on the approval of the applicable state or federal government regulator, which could result in the exclusion of some carriers, including us, from the exchanges.\nWe believe the exchanges have, and will continue to represent a significant commercial business opportunity for us. For example, our individual commercial enrollment increased nearly 190 percent during 2014, driven in large part by enrollment in the exchanges through the first open enrollment period. However, as we complete our second enrollment period, changing economic conditions, the dynamic competitive environment on the exchanges, various legislative and legal developments and the ongoing evolution of the regulatory framework for the exchanges may alter the economics and structure of our participation in the exchanges, which remain a new marketplace with which we have limited experience. If we are not able to successfully adapt to any such changes in our markets, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected. As an example, the size and mix of the exchange market pool is subject to change based on changes in the U.S. economy, changes to eligibility rules and processes and any changes to the validity of premium tax credits on FFEs. The exchange market pool is also impacted by changes in unemployment rates, average household income, and changes in employer coverage. In addition, the exchange market pool is impacted by the new processes for redetermination of eligibility based on income, employer coverage and eligibility management activities. These factors are generally beyond our control.\nFurthermore, the complexity of the process may cause confusion for new consumers seeking to enroll for the first time as well as renewing consumers who may see changes in their plans and premium responsibility. In some cases, individuals have been terminated from exchange coverage or had their eligibility for subsidies adjusted or terminated due to a failure to provide documentation verifying eligibility, which results in additional administrative costs or membership losses for issuers. This complexity has required us to increase our consumer outreach and education efforts and modify our information systems to adapt to these new rules. In addition, while we have adapted our products and sales practices to the new direct-to-consumer channel opened by the exchanges, the exchanges have also required, and will continue to require, us to market to and administer premium collection through a new population with which we have limited experience. This new exchange population presents additional operational challenges, including the potential for discontinuance of coverage due to premium delinquency. Any failure to successfully implement these initiatives or modifications in response to developing regulations may have an adverse impact on our exchange membership and profitability on the exchanges.\nDue to legislative developments and regulatory allowances designed to help smooth the transition into the ACA, there are a number of other aspects of the exchanges that have yet to be fully implemented or where there are still outstanding questions, including many of the primary functionalities of the SHOP plans, which were delayed until 2015, and certain aspects of the ACA\u2019s premium stabilization provisions. For additional information, see the risk factor above under the heading, \u201c-If we do not effectively incorporate the ACA\u2019s premium stabilization and other related provisions into our business, or these provisions are not successful in mitigating our financial risks, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\u201d In addition, recent lawsuits filed by stakeholders on the exchanges have raised questions for exchange participants, including us, surrounding provider network size, network capacity and the adequacy of communication between health insurers and their consumers with respect to network composition for exchange products. In addition, state and federal regulators have expressed concern about provider network adequacy for exchange products. For example, the CDI recently issued an emergency regulation to establish stronger requirements for health insurers to create and maintain sufficient medical provider networks to provide timely access to medical care. In order to comply with the regulation, which was effective as of February 2, 2015, we and other health insurers will need to devote resources and incur significant costs. These and other similar actions by courts or regulators in this area may require us to adjust our tailored network exchange strategy or make other material modifications to our\nbusiness and operations. Our exchange strategy relies heavily on our use of tailored network products and whether or not we are required to make adjustments to our networks, there is no assurance that our tailored network strategy will be successful over time. See \u201c-The markets in which we do business are highly competitive. If we do not design and price our product offerings competitively, our membership and profitability could decline\u201d for additional information regarding our tailored network strategy.\nOur continued success on the exchanges is also dependent on our ability to respond to changes in the competitive market over time. The exchanges are an open market, with pricing and membership data publicly available to both consumers and our competitors. All exchange participants, including us, have reviewed our competitive positions, and with this data, our competitors could modify their product features or networks, change their pricing relative to others in the market and adjust their mix of business within or outside the exchanges. Competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may also introduce pricing that we may not be able to match, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nTaken together, the exchanges\u2019 untested nature, the evolving marketplace surrounding them and the responses of state and federal decision makers to these issues have created lingering uncertainty for us and other health insurers participating in the exchanges. For example, on July 7, 2014, California Senate Bill 1446 (\u201cSB 1446\u201d) was signed into law effective immediately, allowing insurance carriers to continue non-grandfathered and non-ACA compliant small group policies that were in effect as of December 31, 2013 and active as of July 7, 2014 for one additional year through December 31, 2015. Arizona has similarly issued guidance allowing non-compliant plans to renew in some instances. While we expect that these transitional policies will help to reduce rate impact for many small groups that have not yet transitioned to ACA-compliant health plans, which in turn may help to reduce membership turnover in our small group business, these and similar allowances and extensions have demonstrated the ability of state and federal decision makers to revise the operational rules and regulations relating to the exchanges, in some cases with retroactive effect, in order to address future implementation or other difficulties. These types of delays or adjustments may in turn impact the economics of the exchange marketplace and the success of our strategy with respect to the exchanges. The resultant uncertainty extends to certain aspects of the exchanges that remain under consideration, including among other things, the premium stabilization provisions described in further detail herein. The fluid and novel nature of the exchange marketplace impacts our ability to predict exchange enrollment, premiums and costs, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. If we fail to effectively adapt our business strategy and operations to these evolving regulations and markets, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs.\nA substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services and supplies delivered to our members. Many of these costs, including costs associated with physician and hospital care, new medical technology and prescription drugs, for example, are rising. The total amount of health care costs we incur is affected by the number and type of individual services we provide and the cost of each service. Our future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to manage future health care utilization and costs through product pricing criteria, utilization management, product design, medical management initiatives and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts. Periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts, coupled with continued consolidation of physician, hospital and other provider groups, may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused, and are expected to continue to cause, the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs. Additionally, there is always the possibility that adverse risk selection could occur when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans rather than risk moving to another plan, or, in the case of the exchanges, that members who elect to purchase products through the exchange will utilize higher levels of health care services than those in off exchange products. Moreover, the introduction of new populations with which there is limited cost experience, including through Medicaid expansion, the exchanges and the CCI, as well as the uncertain impact of premium stabilization provisions on the industry could adversely affect our ability to accurately predict or control health care costs. Any of these factors could cause our health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations.\nOther factors that may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs and, as a result, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows include but are not limited to changes in utilization rates; demographic characteristics; catastrophes; large scale public health epidemics; terrorist activity; unanticipated seasonality; changes in provider reimbursement; fluctuations in medical cost trends; the regulatory\nenvironment, including, for example, the implementation of the ACA or other state or federal laws and their impact on our health care costs and our ability to change our premium rates; health care practices; the introduction of new therapies, treatments or drugs; inflation; new technologies; clusters of high-cost cases; and continued consolidation of physician, hospital and other provider groups. A significant category of our health care costs is the cost of hospital-based products and services. Factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include, but are not limited to, the underfunding of public programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare and the constant pressure that places on rates from commercial health plans, new technology, state initiated mandates, alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters, an aging population, changes in the economic environment and, under certain circumstances, relatively low levels of hospital competition caused by market concentration. Another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services. Factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include, but are not limited to, the price of drugs, utilization of new and existing drugs, changes in discounts and the impact of health care reform on pharmaceutical manufacturers through such requirements as increased fees. For example, drugs recently approved for the treatment of hepatitis C have been aggressively priced by pharmaceutical companies. Due to the relatively high incidence of hepatitis C in populations we serve and a number of factors that may drive significant demand for these therapies, these products may cause a significant increase in our health care costs and, if we are unable to effectively manage these costs, it may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nAs a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products, our annual pre-tax income for 2014 would have been reduced by approximately $113 million. The inability to accurately forecast and manage our health care costs in all circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices. If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover our costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service, plan benefits and the quality and depth of provider networks, price has been and will continue to be a significant basis of competition. Any future increase in our premiums could result in the loss of members, particularly in light of continued economic pressures and the implementation of the ACA. Our premiums are set in advance of the actual delivery of services, and, in certain circumstances, before contracting with providers. While we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care and other costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge or bid, factors such as competition, new or changed regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs. For example, certain of our competitors are not subject to the ACA's health insurer fee or are assessed at half the rate that we and other health insurers will pay, and our ability to incorporate the impact of the health insurer fee into our commercial and Medicare 2015 premium rates, which are set a year in advance in 2014, was limited, in large part due to these competitive pressures. In addition, many factors may, and often do, cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors include, but are not limited to, increased utilization rates, increasing medical cost trends, catastrophes, public health epidemics, terrorist activity, unanticipated seasonality, changes in insured population characteristics, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, including those included in the ACA or other state or federal laws. If we are unable to accurately estimate costs and set our premiums accordingly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our ability to increase our premiums may be restricted by law. For example, the ACA requires the establishment of a process for review of certain premium rate increases to determine whether they are \u201cunreasonable.\u201d As part of this rate review process, certain insurers may be excluded from participating in the state-based or federally facilitated exchanges created by the ACA if the review determines that the insurer has demonstrated a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium rate increases. The federal government and some states in which we do business have also required prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases and/or have subjected such increases to heightened scrutiny, such as third-party review. For example, the CDI and Department of Managed Health Care require a third-party actuarial review of health insurance carriers' and health plans' proposed premium rate increases to confirm compliance with applicable law, resulting in a potential delay in carriers' and plans' ability to implement rate increases. Further, in California, proponents of rate review qualified an initiative measure for the November 2014 ballot that would have, if approved, imposed significant additional requirements on health plans relating to premium increases. While the initiative was defeated, there can be no assurance that the California legislature will not consider similar rate regulation measures in the future. These requirements and proposed changes have in the past and could in the future,\namong other things, lower the amount of premium increases we receive or extend the amount of time that it takes for us to obtain regulatory approval to implement increases in our premium rates. In recent years, certain of our competitors were asked by the Commissioner of the CDI to voluntarily delay implementation of scheduled premium increases to permit additional review by the CDI, which review led the carriers to reduce proposed rate increases. We have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, greater scrutiny by regulators of proposed increases to our premium rates. For additional detail on the impact of federal health care reform and potential additional changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on our ability to maintain or increase premium levels, see \u201c-Federal health care reform legislation has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on the costs of operating our business and a failure to successfully execute our operational and strategic initiatives with respect thereto could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations,\u201d \"-The ACA has been the subject of various legal challenges and legislative initiatives, which increase the uncertainty of how the law will impact us,\"\u201c-Various health insurance reform proposals continue to emerge at the state level, which could have an adverse impact on us,\u201d \"-If we do not effectively incorporate the ACA\u2019s premium stabilization and other related provisions into our business, or these provisions are not successful in mitigating our financial risks, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected,\" and \"-We cannot assure you that our participation in the ACA\u2019s health insurance exchanges will continue to be a success\" (collectively the \"ACA Risk Factors\"). Our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels.\nThe ACA and other federal and state legislation and regulations require a reconciliation of premiums based on a final assessment of the relative medical risk a health plan incurs in the individual and small group market. Since the risk value is based on a health plan\u2019s score relative to the industry and enrollment growth of new populations with limited cost experience under ACA, we may be required to accrue additional liabilities based on the risk profile of the overall population. In addition, the ACA requires us to maintain certain minimum medical loss ratios, or \u201cMLRs\u201d. In the event we fail to maintain such minimum MLRs, we will be required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers annually. Certain state Medicaid programs, including with respect to the Medi-Cal expansion population, are imposing MLR requirements on Medicaid managed care organizations that generally require such plans to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their state customers if they cannot demonstrate they have met the minimum MLRs. With respect to our Medi-Cal expansion population, this MLR requirement acts as a \u201ccorridor\u201d, with rebates paid to DHCS for MLRs under 85% and additional premium paid to us by DHCS if MLRs exceed 95%. Beginning in 2014, we have been required to incorporate the effect of the aforementioned premium stabilization provisions for individual and small group markets into our commercial MLRs. Due in part to the uncertainty with respect to these premium stabilization provisions, which as noted above will be calculated for the first time in the summer of 2015 for the 2014 benefit year, it may be difficult to accurately predict our commercial MLR rebates, which may cause meaningful disruptions in our market share and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. For further information on MLRs, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, and for further information on premium stabilization provisions, see \"-If we do not effectively incorporate the ACA\u2019s premium stabilization and other related provisions into our business, or these provisions are not successful in mitigating our financial risks, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\"\nThe markets in which we do business are highly competitive. If we do not design and price our product offerings competitively, our membership and profitability could decline.\nWe are in a highly competitive industry that is currently subject to significant changes from, among other things, legislative reform, business consolidations and new strategic alliances. Many of our competitors may have certain characteristics, capabilities or resources, such as greater market share, greater economies of scale, superior provider and supplier arrangements and existing business relationships, which give them an advantage in competing with us. These competitors include HMOs, PPOs, self-funded employers, insurance companies, hospitals, health care facilities and other health care providers. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future.\nThe addition of new competitors in our industry can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. For example, the new developing marketplace created by the ACA's state-based and federally facilitated exchanges has and may continue to encourage new market participants and lead to increased competition in the individual and small group markets. There also is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us, which could result in a decrease in our revenues. In addition, our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us.\nIn addition, in response to changes in the health care market, including those related to federal and state health care reform, our competitors have in the past and could in the future modify their product features or benefits, change their pricing relative to others in the market and adjust their mix of business within or outside the exchanges, or even exit segments of the market. We may not be able to match our competitors' ability to support reduced premiums by virtue of any full or partial exemptions from the fees and taxes imposed by the ACA, or by making changes to their distribution arrangements, decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services, or otherwise adjusting their operating costs and reducing general and administrative expenses. New competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may also introduce product offerings or pricing that we may not be able to match, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. The response to the ACA over time by our existing competitors and related adjustments to their offerings, if any, could cause meaningful disruption in local health care markets in which we operate.\nIn addition, while certain types of entities and benefits are exempt from the calculation of the health insurer fee, including, among others, government entities, certain non-profit insurers and self-funded plans, we are unable to take advantage of any significant exemptions due to our current mix of plans and product lines. Consequently, the health insurer fee will represent a higher percentage of our premium revenues than those of certain of our competitors who are able to exempt all or a portion of their premium revenues from the health insurer fee allocation. Moreover, some of our competitors may have greater economies of scale or a different mix of business, which, among other things, may lead to lower expense ratios and higher profit margins than we have. For additional discussion of how the ACA continues to affect the competitive landscape in which we operate, see the ACA Risk Factors above.\nIn recent years, there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers, such as the hospital, medical group, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. This activity may create stronger competitors and/or result in higher health care costs. Furthermore, since the adoption of the ACA, we have seen further provider consolidation, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to negotiate competitive rates. In addition, our contracts with government agencies, such as our Medicaid contracts, T-3 contract for the TRICARE North Region and MFLC contracts, are from time to time up for re-bid. If we were to lose any significant government contract to a competitor, or if we were to win the bid for such contract on less favorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs or if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\u201d for more information regarding our government contracts. To the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market, our ability to retain or increase our number of customers, our revenue growth, our pricing flexibility, our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected.\nTailored network products are an important part of our business strategy. Recently we have seen aggressive pricing by our competitors on certain tailored network products, and we will need to continue developing innovative provider relationships to remain competitive. For example, we have been working to build alliances with provider groups and other stakeholders in the health care system through shared risk arrangements, including Accountable Care Organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d), that have seen increasing support as state and federal governments and the health care industry seek to improve the quality of care while controlling the costs of such care. Cost conscious large group customers that have embraced tailored networks are important to our ability to maintain scale in tailored network products, and some of these customers, including certain Medicare customers, may demand that we provide ACO or similar arrangements to reduce costs, or may seek to join a private health insurance exchange to pool risk and lower costs. Our ability to successfully implement such arrangements or design products for the private exchanges may be necessary to remain competitive for these accounts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement and maintain these strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future profitable growth in the post-ACA marketplace; that the products we have designed in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected; or that the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors. The loss of large group customers in tailored networks may make it more difficult to efficiently execute our tailored network strategy, which could have a material adverse impact on our commercial business.\nThese tailored networks are based on provider networks that may not include all hospitals or medical professionals. We cannot control the capacity of these organizations to serve new membership coming from other health plans or as a result of the ACA. With the growth in tailored network offerings in the State of California, there has been increased scrutiny by regulators and consumer watchdog groups with respect to network adequacy. For example, recent regulatory action and class action lawsuits have raised concerns regarding provider network size, network capacity and the adequacy of communication between health insurers and their consumers with respect to network composition for\nexchange products. Such regulatory action and lawsuits may require us to make changes to our provider networks, which could result in higher costs, deterioration in our competitive position and in membership loss. Failure to successfully implement our tailored network strategy may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we do not design and price our products appropriately and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we set rates too high or too low for highly competitive markets, if we lose membership in more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in less profitable products, if we do not provide satisfactory service levels, if membership or demand for our services does not increase as we expect or if membership or demand for our services declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur reserves for claims are estimates of incurred costs based on a number of assumptions. An extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process and considerable variability is inherent in such estimates. The accuracy of these estimates also may be affected by external forces such as, for example, changes in medical claims submissions and payment patterns and medical cost trends. Included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) and for claims received but not processed. Our methodology for calculating these estimates is consistently applied from period to period, and our IBNR best estimate is made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required. Any adjustments to the prior period IBNR best estimates are included in the current period. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of IBNR. Given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates, the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts reserved. If such a revision in our estimates results in significant unfavorable development, it could adversely affect current period net income, profitability per enrolled member and, subsequently, our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period. Our stock price could also be negatively impacted. If our actual claims liability is lower than estimated, it could mean that we set premium prices too high, which could result in a loss of membership. For additional information regarding our methodology in establishing our reserves for claims and other settlements, see \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d.\nOur businesses are subject to laws and significant rules and regulations, which increases our cost of doing business and could impact our financial performance by restricting our ability to conduct business or adversely affecting our ability to grow our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, financial requirements, licensing requirements, enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies. Our HMO and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves, minimum net worth, premium rates, approval of policy language and benefits, appeals and grievances with respect to benefit determinations, provider contracting, utilization management, issuance and termination of policies, claims payment practices and a wide variety of other regulations relating to the development and operation of health plans. These laws, rules, and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as Health Net. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses. The laws, rules, and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws, rules, and regulations are subject to frequent change, and there is no guarantee that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these laws, rules, and regulations to interpret them and to impose substantial fines or restrict our ability to do business when they believe violations or failures to meet standards or requirements have occurred. Regulatory agencies, such as the California Department of Managed Health Care, the California Department of Health Care Services, the CDI, CMS, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Office of Civil Rights and state departments of insurance, have the authority to impose substantial fines and/or penalties against us, require us to change how we do business and restrict our business activities. Certain of these agencies have done so in the past, and may impose substantial fines and/or penalties against us, require us to change how we do business and restrict our business activities in the future if they determine that we have not complied with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Further, such fines, penalties and restrictions may be more severe in circumstances in which regulatory agencies determine that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. See \u201c-Federal and state audits, reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows\u201d for further discussion on the impact of any fines, penalties or restrictions that may be imposed against us. As we have members in various states and are therefore subject to the regulatory oversight of multiple jurisdictions, we have been in the past, and could be in the future, subject to fines and/or penalties imposed by multiple regulatory agencies relating to the same incident. Existing or future laws, rules, and regulations, including the ACA and related health care reform initiatives could, among other things, force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and/or enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs, and/or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members, providers or others. See the ACA Risk Factors above. Further, we may be liable for violations of laws, rules and regulations by individual Health Net associates notwithstanding our internal policies and compliance programs. For example, see \u201c-If we or our business associates that handle certain information on our behalf fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security, among other things, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.\u201d\nAs a federal and state government contractor, we are subject to U.S. and state government oversight. The government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those audits and investigations, the government could make claims against us. Under government procurement regulations and practices, a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined, debarred and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time. In addition, we are subject to state and federal false claims laws that generally prohibit the submission of false claims for reimbursement or payment to government agencies. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Courts have imposed substantial fines and penalties against companies found to have violated these laws. We are also exposed to other risks associated with U.S. and state government contracting, including but not limited to dependence upon Congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds, the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow, and the general ability of federal and/or state government to terminate contracts with it, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain or maintain, governmental approvals, or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities, could adversely affect our revenue or membership, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. See \u201c-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs or if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\u201d\nWe are subject to a number of risks in connection with our decision to enter into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities.\nOn November 2, 2014, we entered into a master services agreement (as subsequently amended and restated, the \u201cCognizant MSA\u201d) with a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\u201cCognizant\u201d) for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities. As a result of the agreement, we anticipate a material reduction in our annual general and administrative and depreciation expense by 2017. However, the agreement is conditioned upon regulatory approval of the transaction, and there can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. Regulators may also require us to make changes to the current structure of the transaction (including, without limitation, the scope of services covered by the transaction) as a condition precedent to approval. If regulatory approval is not obtained, substantially delayed or conditioned on changes to the terms of the transaction being made, we may not be able to fully realize anticipated cost savings or other expected benefits of the transaction. We have incurred material costs and will continue to incur material incremental costs and devote substantial resources to prepare for the Cognizant transaction. If regulatory approval is not obtained or the Cognizant MSA is otherwise terminated prior to Cognizant\u2019s commencement of services, we will lose some or all of the resources that have been and will be invested in this transaction through such date, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe Cognizant MSA covers a broad range of consulting, technological and administrative services in claims management, membership and benefits configuration, customer contact center services, information technology, quality assurance, appeals and grievance services, and medical management support. We also expect that certain of our employees will become employees of Cognizant or its subcontractors, and that certain positions will be eliminated, as part of the transaction. Given the scope of services that will be provided by Cognizant, and assuming the transaction closes, the transition presents considerable execution risk inherent to large scale strategic and operational initiatives,\nincluding, among others, with respect to the efficient and secure transfer of information and data and the management of our workforce, which will require us to coordinate and monitor the transition through our dedicated governance and oversight structure.\nThe success of our business will depend in part on Cognizant\u2019s ability to perform the contracted functions and services in a timely, satisfactory, and compliant manner. If we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a timely, satisfactory or compliant manner, we may not fully achieve anticipated cost savings or other expected benefits of the transaction; we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions; we may be vulnerable to security breaches that threaten the security and confidentiality of our information and data; we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers or be subject to claims against us by our members; and we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWhile the Cognizant MSA requires Cognizant to meet all regulatory compliance requirements with respect to the services provided, we ultimately retain responsibility for regulatory compliance. If we fail to adequately monitor and regulate Cognizant\u2019s performance throughout the term of the Cognizant MSA, we may be subject to additional risk. For additional information on these and other risks associated with third party arrangements such as the Cognizant transaction, please refer to the risk factors set forth below under the heading \u201c-We are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties\u201d and \u201c-Federal and state audits, reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.\u201d\nOur participation in the dual eligibles demonstration portion of the California Coordinated Care Initiative in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons.\nThe CCI, and the dual eligibles demonstration program in particular, is a model of providing health care that is new to regulatory authorities and health plans in the State of California. Our participation and success in the dual eligibles demonstration is subject to a number of risks inherent in untested health care initiatives and new populations with limited cost experience. For example, the CCI requires us to provide benefits with which we had limited operating experience, including but not limited to LTSS benefits. Our failure to successfully organize and deliver on this model would negatively affect the operating and financial success of this business opportunity.\nSome of the risks involved in the CCI and our participation in the dual eligibles demonstration include:\n\u2022\nDual eligibles are generally among the most chronically ill individuals within each of Medicare and Medi-Cal, requiring a complex range of services from multiple providers. If we do not accurately predict the costs of providing benefits to dual eligibles or the rates under our agreement with CMS and DHCS prove to be inadequate, our participation in the CCI may prove to be unprofitable.\n\u2022\nOur profitability in the CCI will be dependent in part on our ability to successfully provide and administer LTSS benefits, both directly and through subcontracting arrangements with third parties. Because we have limited operating experience in providing and administering these benefits, particularly with respect to cost management, there is no assurance that the arrangements we have made and are continuing to refine will be on favorable terms or that the information exchange between us and these third parties will allow us to efficiently manage member care, which may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly as our Medi-Cal membership increases through, among other things, Medicaid expansion.\n\u2022\nDual eligibles have the option to opt out of the dual eligibles demonstration while retaining all of their Medi-Cal benefits under CCI, including LTSS, which may reduce or eliminate the inherent efficiencies of the dual eligibles demonstration portion of the CCI. In particular, while the provision and administration of LTSS benefits may increase Medi-Cal costs, successfully managing care for these LTSS recipients may generate equal or greater Medicare savings in the form of reduced costs for treatment for acute conditions and/or hospitalizations. In the first year of the CCI, we experienced opt-out rates that were higher than originally anticipated. If large numbers of dual eligibles continue to opt out of the dual eligibles demonstration, we may be unable to capitalize on such potential efficiencies in the dual demonstration portion of the CCI, and, as a result, we may not be able to maximize our investment in the CCI and our profitability with respect to our participation in the CCI may be lower than originally anticipated.\n\u2022\nIn each county, we will be offered as one of the health plans selected to participate in the CCI. Dual eligibles in each county will be able to select to receive benefits from any of the participating health plans. As a result of such competitive factors, we may not attract a satisfactory number of dual eligibles.\n\u2022\nWe are required to make required filings with, and obtain approvals from, regulatory authorities in order to meet the ongoing demands of the CCI. There can be no assurance that we will obtain these approvals on satisfactory terms, or at all.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to various other risks and uncertainties associated with participating in government programs such as Medicare and Medi-Cal. For example, the agreement we have with DHCS and CMS governing the dual eligibles demonstration may be terminated by DHCS and CMS without cause upon 180 days prior notice. Furthermore, the CCI itself is subject to changing legislation and regulations as well as state budgetary concerns. For example, the California Director of Finance is required to annually evaluate the CCI\u2019s cost effectiveness and report to the state legislature. If the legislature determines that the CCI is not cost effective, the program may be suspended. Furthermore, potential cost savings that were expected to improve the cost effectiveness of the program may be limited due to certain modifications imposed after the CCI became effective. These changes include the exemption of more than 100,000 potential beneficiaries from the dual eligibles demonstration based on their enrollment in Medicare D-SNP programs, their age or health condition, the transfer of significant savings initially allocated under the program from the state to the federal government, and the federal direction to suspend a tax that the state had used to fund the program implementation. The state has developed a new tax proposal that it believes complies with federal guidelines, but there is no assurance that it will successfully be enacted and approved. The 2015-16 California state budget projects net savings for the upcoming fiscal year, but also discusses potential risks, which, if not addressed by January 2016, could lead to the termination of the program in January 2017. See \u201c-Medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk\u201d, \u201c-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs or if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, we may experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\u201d and \u201c-Federal and state audits, reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows\u201d.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance that the business opportunity presented by the CCI, including the dual eligibles demonstration, will prove to be successful. Our failure to successfully adapt to the requirements of the CCI, the inability of the program to generate the necessary cost savings for the state or the termination or suspension of the program by the state could have a adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nGovernment programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs, if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, or if we experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nApproximately 61% of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 relate to federal, state and local government health care coverage or counseling programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and MFLC. Nearly all of the revenues in our Government Contracts reportable segment, which does not include Medicare and Medicaid related revenues, come from the federal government, either directly or as a sub-contractor for a federal government contract. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations\u201d for more information regarding our reportable segments. In addition, a growing portion of our revenues for our Western Region Operations reportable segment, which includes Medicare and Medicaid related revenues, relates to government programs. Our Medicaid premium revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were approximately $4.8 billion, an increase of 95.7% from the prior year. The portion of our Western Region Operations reportable segment that relates to government programs is expected to increase in 2015 as, among other things, new members continue to enroll under both Medicaid expansion and the dual eligibles demonstration. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Western Region Operations Reportable Segment-California Coordinated Care Initiative\u201d and \u201c-Our participation in the dual eligibles demonstration portion of the California Coordinated Care Initiative in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons\u201d for more information regarding our opportunities under the CCI and related risks. Due to this concentration of revenues, a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur contracts with the government are generally subject to a highly-structured competitive bid process and government discretion in the negotiation process, including with respect to performance requirements. If we fail to design and maintain programs attractive to our government customers, if we are not successful in winning new contracts or contract renewals on favorable terms, or if our existing contracts are terminated, our current government health care coverage or counseling programs business and our ability to expand these businesses could be materially and adversely affected. Under government-funded health programs, the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels and generally has the ability to terminate our contract for convenience. Any reduction in premium or reimbursement levels by the government payor, such as a reduction in Medicare Advantage payment rates as provided in the ACA, may lead to payment delay or result in premiums that increase at a lower rate than cost. If we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans, we could be adversely affected. In addition, the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements for our Government Contracts reportable segment represents our best estimate of the government's liability to us under TRICARE, MFLC, PC3 and other government contracts, or amounts due us as a sub-contractor. These government receivables are generally estimates subject to government audit and negotiation, and there is an inherent uncertainty in government contracts based in large part on a vulnerability to disagreements with the government. As a result, the final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts for our Government Contracts reportable segment may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize in our consolidated financial statements. Medicare revenue that we record may also be subject to change due to risk adjustment reimbursement settlements. See \u201c-Medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk\u201d for additional information about risks related to these risk adjustment reimbursement settlements. Moreover, with respect to the ACA's premium stabilization provisions, the final determination and settlement of amounts due or payable relating to the 2014 calendar year will not occur until June 2015, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.\nContracts under our government programs are generally subject to frequent change, including but not limited to changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, expand or reduce the scope of the contract, reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs, as applicable, under such programs. An enrollment freeze or significant reduction in payments from government programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Such changes may occur during re-competition of government contracts, for example. The T-3 contract for our TRICARE business expires on March 31, 2015. In June 2014, at the Department of Defense's request, we submitted a proposal to add three additional one-year options to our existing T-3 contract. The DoD has also informed us that it intends to complete its negotiations with us for the options prior to March 31, 2015, and that if such negotiations are successful, it intends to exercise the first of the one-year options by that date. However, there can be no assurance that we will finalize negotiations prior to March 31, 2015 or that we will do so at rates greater than or equal to those under the current T-3 contract. In the event the extension results in significantly reduced rates or if we are unable to finalize negotiations and our TRICARE business is opened up for rebidding and we are unable to secure a contract in the rebidding process, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. For additional information on our TRICARE operations, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Government Contracts Reportable Segment.\u201d\nIn addition, the reimbursement rates we receive from federal and state governments relating to our government-funded health care coverage programs may be subject to change. For example, on April 1, 2014, CMS announced final 2015 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for 2015 Medicare Advantage and Part D payments that we receive in connection with our participation in these programs. These payment rates represent reduced funding from the federal government compared to prior periods and adversely impacted our expected Medicare revenues for 2014. CMS announced proposed Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for 2016 on February 20, 2015, which set forth slight reductions to payment rates. Furthermore, if Medicare Advantage rates decline, our competitors may exit certain counties in which we participate, which may increase adverse selection risk and negatively impact our profitability. Any significant reduction in the reimbursement rates that we receive in connection with our government-funded health care coverage programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, particularly as our membership in and focus on government programs increases.\nFurthermore, Medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (\u201csequestration\u201d), subject to a 2% cap. Certain other programs, including Medicaid benefits, are exempt from the sequestration cuts. All parts of the Medicare program, including Medicare Advantage, were subject to cuts, and these reductions have adversely impacted our Medicare Advantage MCR. In addition, reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by, among other things, terminating or materially changing such programs, or by\ndecreasing or delaying payments made under such programs. In addition, legislation is currently being considered to repeal the \u201csustainable growth rate\u201d formula that is used to calculate Medicare physician payments and replacing it with a new formula. While it is not currently clear what the details of any such legislation would be, such legislation, if finalized, could possibly make further cuts to Medicare payments or various related programs in order to offset the cost of the new payment formula.\nFederal and state governments could also choose to require benefits to be delivered to new populations of potential members or require us to deliver new services to existing populations. If we have limited cost experience with these new populations or services, we may not be able to accurately predict or adequately control the associated health care costs. For example, as part of the CCI, we are required to expand our current Medi-Cal offerings to provide LTSS benefits to all our existing Medi-Cal members, including SPDs and those who do not participate in the dual eligibles demonstration portion of the CCI. We have limited operating experience in providing LTSS benefits, and if we are not able to successfully manage the associated costs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our entrance into the Medicaid program in Arizona and Medicaid expansion in both California and Arizona have and will continue to significantly increase our Medicaid enrollment. This population of members may have different characteristics than our Medicaid population prior to Medicaid expansion. Moreover, both Medicaid expansion and the transition of individuals between the California individual exchange and Medi-Cal will result in changes to enrollment in both Medi-Cal and our exchange population, which will require us to maintain efficient information systems and coordinate efforts with multiple state and local agencies to help ensure that these individuals maintain continuous coverage. If we do not accurately predict the costs of providing benefits to these new populations, fail to obtain suitable rates or otherwise fail to efficiently and effectively incorporate these new and changing populations into our existing business, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFinally, we are also exposed to other risks associated with U.S. and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor, including but not limited to the general ability of the federal and/or state government to terminate contracts with it, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance; potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed; and our dependence upon Congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity. For example, due to the federal government shutdown in October 2013, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs, Defense Health Agency delayed reimbursement payments owed to us for underwritten claims under the T-3 contract for our TRICARE business. These reimbursement payments were ultimately received following the conclusion of the government shutdown, and the delay did not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, there can be no assurance that we will avoid similar payment delays in the future, which, if extended for any significant period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows or liquidity. In addition, delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain or maintain, governmental approvals, or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities, could adversely affect our revenue or membership, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted.\nOther changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk.\nMedicare programs represent a significant portion of our business, accounting for approximately 23% of our total premium revenue in our Western Region Operations reportable segment in 2014 and an expected 19% in 2015. The ACA includes, among other things, provisions that significantly reduce the government\u2019s Medicare payment rates. For more information on the risks associated with the ACA, see the ACA Risk Factors above. These ACA mandated reductions in Medicare payment rates have in the past and may continue in the future to have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. For example, on February 20, 2015, CMS announced proposed Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for 2016, which reflected slight funding reductions from the prior year. In addition, all parts of the Medicare program, including Medicare Advantage, are subject to the risks of reduced government funding, including in connection with significant spending reductions in connection with the Budget Control Act of 2011. For additional detail on these cuts and the potential effect on our Medicare business, see \u201c-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs, if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, or if we experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nor results of operations.\u201d The cumulative impact of reductions in reimbursement rates, funding reductions and other factors has had an adverse impact on the profitability of our Medicare business in the past, and any further significant reductions in the reimbursement rates that we receive in connection with our Medicare business could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, particularly as our membership in and focus on government programs increases, including through the dual eligibles demonstration.\nIf we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants; if our Medicare operations are subject to sanctions or penalties; if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts; or if our existing contracts are terminated, our current Medicare business and our ability to expand our Medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected, negatively impacting our financial performance. There are also specific additional risks under Title XVIII, Part D of the Social Security Act associated with our provision of Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits as part of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings. These risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables, inadequacy of pricing assumptions, inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs, as well as the underlying seasonality of this business, and extended settlement periods for claims submissions. Our failure to comply with Part D program requirements can result in financial and/or operational sanctions on our Part D products, as well as on our Medicare Advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage.\nIn connection with our participation in the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs, we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by CMS. This mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its Medicare enrollees. Under the CMS risk adjustment methodology, all Medicare Advantage plans must collect and submit diagnosis code data from hospitals and physician providers to CMS by specified deadlines. CMS uses this diagnosis information to calculate the risk adjusted premium paid to Medicare Advantage plans throughout the year. For any given year, the final settlement of these risk adjustment payments is generally made in the third quarter of the following year. Because the recorded revenue associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism is based on our best estimate at the time, the actual payment we receive from CMS for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements. See \u201c-Federal and state audits, reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows\u201d for information on potential audits of the coding practices and provider documentation supporting the risk adjustment payments that we receive for our Medicare members.\nIn addition, CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between one and five stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance on certain measures of quality. The Star Ratings are used by CMS to award quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans. Beginning with the 2014 Star Rating, (calculated in the Fall of 2013), Medicare Advantage plans were required to achieve a minimum of 4 Stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment in 2015. The methodology and measures included in the Star Ratings system can be modified by CMS annually and Star Ratings thresholds are based on performance of Medicare Advantage plans nationally. For the 2015 Star rating (2016 payment year), our California HMO and Oregon HMO and PPO contracts with CMS were measured at 4.0 Stars. Our Arizona HMO contract was measured at 3.5 Stars and our California PPO contract was measured at 3.0 Stars in the Star Ratings system. This will place approximately 87% of our current membership in 4.0 Star plans for 2015 that qualify for an expected quality bonus payment in 2016. We are continuing to expand efforts and resources to improve our Star Ratings and other quality measures, but a failure to achieve a 4 Star Rating, and consequently failure to qualify for a quality bonus payment in any year, would have an adverse effect on our revenue, income and reputation, and could hinder our ability to compete effectively in the Medicare marketplace.\nIf we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nThe level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability, and we may not be able to manage the level of our administrative expense in all circumstances. In addition, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, higher revenues and greater economies of scale than we do, which among other things, may allow them to more successfully manage their general and administrative expense ratios or make investments in new technologies. While we attempt to effectively manage such expenses, including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies, increases in staff-related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time. These increases could be caused by any number of things, including difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies, our entrance into new relationships with third parties, such as the arrangement we entered into with Cognizant in November 2014,\nacquisitions and divestitures, business or product start-ups or expansions, such as, for example, our participation in the CCI and the health insurance exchanges, changes in business or regulatory requirements, including compliance with the ACA, ICD-10 and HIPAA regulations, or other reasons. In addition, any failure to appropriately manage our general and administrative expenses could require us to increase premium rates in order to cover our health care costs and general and administrative expenses.\nDuring recent years we have dedicated significant resources to implement programs designed to achieve general and administrative cost savings and improve our operational performance. As a part of these programs, we have and will continue to contract with key strategic partners in an effort to ultimately lower our cost structure and incremental costs and consolidate business and management operations, in particular the recent arrangement with Cognizant. Under this arrangement, Cognizant would perform a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities, subject to regulatory approval of the transaction. This transaction would significantly increase the scope of services currently performed for us by third parties. For additional details on the Cognizant transaction, see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-We are subject to a number of risks in connection with our decision to enter into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities.\u201d However, there can be no assurance that our strategies to reduce our general and administrative costs and improve our operational performance will be successful or achieve anticipated savings.\nIn addition, in order to offset some of the reduced revenues from certain of our contracts, we continuously make efforts to reduce, reallocate or eliminate certain overhead and other administrative expenses. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in making these cuts and adjustments at a pace that will maintain or increase our profitability.\nOur business is regionally concentrated in the states of California, Arizona and Oregon.\nOur business operations are primarily concentrated in three states: California, particularly Southern California, Arizona and Oregon. The majority of our Medicaid operations are in the state of California, with a high concentration of operations and members in Los Angeles County, and we now participate in the Medicaid program in Arizona. Medicaid expansion and our participation in the dual eligibles demonstration has further increased our concentration in Southern California, particularly Los Angeles County. Due to this geographic concentration, in particular in Southern California, we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results if our health plans in these areas, in particular, Southern California, experience significant losses. In addition, our financial results could be adversely affected by economic conditions in these areas. If economic conditions in the state of California or in the other states in which we operate deteriorate, we may experience reductions in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if reimbursement payments from a state are significantly delayed, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For example, in the past, budget issues have led the state of California to delay certain of its monthly Medicaid payments to us. Any such irregularity in the timing of these payments in future periods may adversely impact our operating cash flow from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of such payments.\nFederal and state audits, reviews and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have been and, in some cases, currently are, involved in various federal and state governmental audits, reviews and investigations. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by government agencies, state insurance and health and welfare departments and others pertaining to financial performance, market conduct and regulatory compliance issues. Such audits, reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate or enroll members in certain programs, or the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions, which could be substantial. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation, audit results, sanctions or penalties could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell our products and services or negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. State attorneys general have become increasingly active in investigating the activities of health plans, and we have received in the past, and may continue to receive in the future, subpoenas and other requests for information as part of these investigations. We have, among other things, entered into consent agreements relating to, and in some instances have agreed to pay fines in connection with, several recent audits and investigations.\nMany regulatory audits, reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers. Our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits, reviews and investigations of this nature. Depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed, regulatory\nfindings could require remediation of any claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe utilize claims submissions, medical records and other medical data as provided by health care providers as the basis for payment requests that we submit to CMS under the risk adjustment model for our Medicare Advantage contracts. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (\u201cRADV\u201d) audits of selected Medicare health plans, including ours, to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Our Arizona and California health plans have been selected for such an audit, though the results will not be known until CMS establishes a baseline \u201cerror rate.\u201d Such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. In February 2012, CMS published a final RADV audit and payment adjustment methodology. The methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited, beginning with 2011 payments, using an extrapolation of the \u201cerror rate\u201d identified in audit samples and, for Medicare Advantage plans, after considering a fee-for-service \u201cerror rate\u201d adjuster that will be used in determining the payment adjustment. Depending on the error rate found in those audits, if any, potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe have been sanctioned in the past by CMS and have been advised that we will be subject to targeted monitoring and heightened surveillance and oversight by CMS going forward. Any future sanctions, fines or penalties against our Medicare operations may be more severe as a result of our past performance, particularly in circumstances in which CMS determines that we have repeatedly failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. If CMS were to impose financial or other penalties and/or sanctions on us, or terminate our existing Medicare contracts, this could have a material adverse effect on our Medicare business, our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See \u201c-Medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk\u201d for additional information about our Medicare programs and the associated risks.\nOn February 4, 2015, we received a notice from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (\u201cAHCCCS\u201d), Division of Health Care Management (\u201cDHCM\u201d) that stated that we were in violation of its contract for Acute Care Medicaid services in Maricopa County. These violations for failure to meet contractual requirements included, among other things, deficiencies related to staffing and support services, website accessibility, provider credentialing, claims processing and grievance and appeals. As a result, DHCM imposed a monetary sanction of $200,000 to be withheld from our future capitation payments, and imposed a cap on auto assignment effective February 13, 2015 until further notice. DHCM also required us to submit corrective action plans as specified in the notice, and stated that any failure to correct the deficiencies outlined in the notice could result in additional compliance actions, including additional sanctions up to non-renewal of the one-year option to extend our Arizona Medicaid contract or termination of the contract in whole or in part. If we were to be subject to additional sanctions or if our contract with AHCCCS was terminated or not renewed, this could have an adverse impact on our Medicaid business, our reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions. In addition, in November 2014 we announced that we entered into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities, subject to regulatory approval of the transaction. This transaction would significantly increase the scope of services currently performed for us by third parties. For additional details on the Cognizant transaction, see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-We are subject to a number of risks in connection with our decision to enter into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities.\u201d Violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business by such third parties, or governing our dealings with such parties, could, among other things, subject us to additional audits, reviews and investigations and adverse effects from such audits, reviews and investigations. In addition, from time to time, government agencies investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors, including but not limited to regular audits to enforce mandatory pricing arrangements. Government investigations of us, whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines and/or penalties being imposed upon us, or could lead to suspension or debarment from government programs or future government contracting, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201c-We are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties\u201d for additional detail regarding risks associated with our relationships with third parties.\nWe face risks related to litigation, which, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties and/or monetary damages, including punitive damages. In addition, we may incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and/or liquidity could be adversely affected if litigation expenses are greater than we project.\nWe have been in the past, are currently, or may become in the future, subject to a variety of legal actions, including but not limited to claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular, such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care, poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged, improper rescission, termination or non-renewal of coverage, and insufficient payments for out-of-network services. These legal actions also include claims brought against companies in general, including, but not limited to employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, wage and hour claims, including, without limitation, cases involving allegations of misclassification of employees and/or failure to pay for off-the-clock work, breach of contract actions, tort claims, fraud and misrepresentation claims, shareholder suits, including, without limitation, suits alleging securities fraud, intellectual property and real estate related disputes, and claims arising from or in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions, including but not limited to actions to block or unwind such transactions. For example, we currently are a party to certain putative class and collective actions relating to the alleged misclassification of certain independent contractors under our MFLC program. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for further information on this matter. In addition, we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims by employer groups for return of premiums; claims by providers, including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement, claims related to self-funded business and claims related to reinsurance matters; and claims alleging information security incidents and breaches. In our role as a federal and state government contractor, we are, and may be in the future, subject to qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government for violations of, among other things, state and federal false claims laws. The legal actions to which we are currently and in the future could be subject can also include allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, unfair or improper business practices and violations of state or federal antitrust laws and can include claims for punitive damages and various forms of injunctive relief. Also, there are currently, and may be in the future, attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations, including us. In some of the cases pending against us, substantial non-economic or punitive damages are also being sought.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty, and we have in the past and continue to incur significant expenses in the defense of litigation matters, including without limitation, substantial discovery costs. Recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face. There is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses, including discovery expenses, in any of the actions we defend in excess of any amounts budgeted for defense. Plaintiffs' attorneys have increasingly used expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic. Responding to these requests, the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents, may require application of significant resources and impose significant costs on us. In certain cases, we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs' counsel.\nWhile we currently have insurance policies that may provide coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation matters, there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for any particular case or liability. Insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded or settlement amounts. In addition, certain liabilities, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. Insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self-insuring cases against us. The deductible on our errors and omissions (\u201cE&O\u201d) insurance has reached such a level. Given the amount of the deductible, the only cases which would be covered by our E&O insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy.\nWe regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us, including those described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. We record reserves and accrue costs for certain significant legal proceedings which represent our best estimate of the probable loss, including related future legal costs, for such matters, both known and unknown. However, our recorded amounts might differ materially from the ultimate amount of any such costs. The costs associated with any settlement of or judgment relating to the various legal proceedings to which we are or may be subject from time to time, such as the proceedings described in Note 13, could be substantial and, in certain cases, could result in a significant earnings charge or impact on our cash flow in any particular quarter. The costs\nassociated with any settlement of or judgment relating to the various legal proceedings to which we are or may be subject from time to time, such as the proceedings described in Note 13, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and/or liquidity and may affect our reputation.\nWe may not be able to manage our membership growth effectively.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our membership as a result of the changing health care environment including the implementation of the exchanges, the CCI and Medicaid expansion in California and Arizona. We have devoted significant resources to manage this rapid growth in our membership, and continuing growth could significantly strain our management and other resources in the future. Our ability to continue managing membership growth effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to modify operational, financial and management information systems and functions on a timely basis and to attract, train, and retain skilled employees. In the event that we are unable to manage our membership growth effectively, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. See \u201c-We cannot assure you that our participation in the ACA\u2019s health insurance exchanges will continue to be a success,\" \"-Our participation in the dual eligibles demonstration portion of the California Coordinated Care Initiative in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons,\" and \"-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to effectively administer these programs, if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, or if we experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\"\u201d for additional information. on the growth we have experienced in certain lines of business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\nWe currently contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions. These third parties provide a material amount of services to us, and include, but are not limited to, information technology infrastructure and applications solutions providers, medical management providers, claims administration providers, billing and enrollment providers, third party providers of actuarial services, call center providers and specialty service providers. In addition, in November 2014 we announced that we entered into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of additional activities, including a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities, subject to regulatory approval of the transaction. For additional details on the Cognizant transaction, see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-We are subject to a number of risks in connection with our decision to enter into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities.\u201d Our current and any future arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data. In addition, we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements. Any contractual remedies and/or indemnification obligations we may have for vendor or service provider failures may not be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses suffered as a result of any vendor's failure to satisfy its obligations to us or under applicable law. Our current and any future outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in the vendor's or service provider's operations, security posture or vulnerabilities, financial condition or other matters outside of our control. If we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers, we could be subject to additional risk. If these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms, may be required to pay a termination fee, which may be significant, and may incur significant costs and/or disruption to our operations in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. In addition, we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers, as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing, unanticipated delays or difficulties in transitioning our operations to the third party, vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and/or regulations, or otherwise. This could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems or disputes that could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nViolations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business or noncompliance with contract terms by third party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members, providers or other third parties, or sanctions and/or fines from the regulators that oversee our business. In turn, this\ncould increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation. In addition, we currently outsource and may in the future outsource key services and functions to third parties, including companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States, including international economic and political conditions, and additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and U.S. laws applicable to operations in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.\nWe face a wide range of risks, and our success depends on our ability to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures.\nAs a large company operating in a complex and highly-regulated industry, we encounter a variety of risks. The risks we face include, among others, a range of strategic, regulatory, competitive, financial, operational, information technology, information security, reputational, external and industry risks identified in this Risk Factors discussion. The third party vendors and service providers to which we outsource key functions are required to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations and contractual requirements. Any violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business, or the terms of our contracts, by third party vendors or service providers could increase our enterprise risk exposure. As we further outsource key functions, this risk increases. We continue to devote resources to further develop and integrate our enterprise-wide risk management processes. Failure to identify, prioritize and appropriately manage or mitigate these risks could adversely affect our profitability, our ability to retain or grow business or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships on competitive terms with the hospitals, provider groups and other providers that provide services to our members, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe contract with hospitals, provider groups and other providers as a means to provide access to health care services for our members, to manage health care costs and utilization and to help ensure the delivery of quality care. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or other contract terms that are unfavorable to us or take other actions, including litigation, which could result in higher health care costs, less desirable or uncompetitive products for customers and members, disruption to provider access or limited access for current members or to support growth, or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations and multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or even monopolies. If these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate contract terms that are unfavorable to us or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. The continuing trend of consolidation of hospitals, provider groups and other providers may further enhance this risk, particularly if such consolidation involves large high cost hospitals, providers or provider groups that we currently have under contract.\nAs the health care environment has evolved, we have developed and are continuously working to monitor strategic provider relationships with respect to the new market driven by, among other things, the ACA, the CCI and other federal and state health care reforms, regulations and initiatives. Accordingly, our business strategy includes creating tailored network products and other customized customer solutions through, among other things, strategic provider relationships that help manage the cost of care. For example, our product portfolios and services include offerings such as SmartCareSM, ExcelCareSM, PureCareSM and CommunityCareSM, which are recent collaborations with our provider partners. Through these types of arrangements, we offer tailored network product offerings served by more cost-effective physician groups and hospitals. Membership in our tailored network products was approximately 50% of total commercial membership as of December 31, 2014, compared with approximately 38% as of December 31, 2013. For additional information on our tailored network products and innovative provider relationships, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Segment Information-Western Region Operations Segment-Managed Health Care Operations.\u201d The success of our tailored network products and continued development of strategic provider relationships are important parts of our business strategy. In addition, we will need to manage our provider network to support our participation in the CCI, including the provision of LTSS benefits for dual eligibles and other individuals, a service that we have not previously provided or managed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives, that the products we design in collaboration with certain providers will be successful or developed within the time periods expected, or the products that we offer will be preferable to similar products of our competitors. Moreover, recent regulatory action and class action lawsuits have raised concerns regarding provider network size, network capacity and the adequacy of communication between health insurers and their consumers with respect to\nnetwork composition for exchange products, which may require us to modify our tailored network strategy. See \u201c-The markets in which we do business are highly competitive. If we do not design and price our product offerings competitively, our membership and profitability could decline.\u201d Failure to successfully implement these strategic initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe contract with professional providers in California for HMO primarily through capitation fee arrangements. Generally, under a capitation fee arrangement, we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member per month and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services, and in some cases, institutional services. Provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with primary care physicians, specialists and other secondary providers to provide services. In addition, we frequently delegate responsibility for certain functions such as claims payment or utilization management to these providers under a \"delegated HMO\" model. The inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us. A provider group's financial instability or failure to pay specialists or secondary providers for services rendered could be exacerbated by the current economic conditions, and could lead specialists or secondary providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our capitated payments to the provider group. We rely on our delegated, capitated physician groups to disburse this payment to their eligible providers, but in the event these groups fail to do so, we may find it necessary to pay such unpaid provider claims depending on state law, regulatory action or other factors. In California, for instance, although legal precedent to date has held that health plans generally are not liable for unpaid provider claims under these circumstances, there can be no assurance that the law will not change, or that we will not be found liable for unpaid provider claims in the future. There can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with specialists or secondary providers, the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the ACA, including for example, the risk adjustment program, may make our existing provider fee arrangements less successful in certain of our market segments. The risk adjustment program defines a health plan's average actuarial risk and subsequently determines such health plan's risk adjustment payment allocation based on the collection of encounter data from providers. This structure puts more heavily capitated health plans such as ours at a disadvantage because providers receiving fixed fees from health insurers do not have the same incentive to provide accurate and complete encounter data with respect to services rendered when compared to providers under fee for service arrangements. This incentive problem is particularly acute under the delegated HMO model, which is prevalent in our California health plans. Under this model, third party intermediaries assume responsibility for certain utilization management and care coordination responsibilities, including the collection of encounter data. As a result, we have been working with providers to enhance our traditional capitation arrangements to help better align our and our providers' interests in capturing accurate and complete encounter data and determining an accurate average actuarial risk. For additional detail on the risk adjustment program and how the ACA and related proposals and initiatives are changing the health care landscape, see the ACA Risk Factors above. There can be no assurance that our efforts in this regard will be successful. Failure to successfully implement this strategy and receive accurate and complete encounter data may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur dependence on capitated provider groups is substantial in our Western Region Operations reportable segment. Approximately 66% of our Western Region Operations members were enrolled with capitated provider groups as of December 31, 2014. Our use of tailored network products also places a greater emphasis on our relationships with certain capitated provider groups, as tailored network products restrict covered members' access to certain physician groups. If these capitated provider groups cannot provide comprehensive services to our members in tailored network products or encounter financial difficulties, it could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations. In addition, the use of tailored network products could create an increased risk of out of network claims issues, which could result in higher medical costs to us.\nThe provider groups that we contract with are also required to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The inability of a provider group to pass compliance audits or otherwise maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations may cause us to terminate a contract with a provider or assume responsibility for the noncompliant functions, such as claims payment or utilization management. Furthermore, violations of, or noncompliance with, applicable laws and/or regulations or contract terms by providers who perform delegated functions for us could increase our exposure to liability to our members or sanctions and/or fines from the regulators that oversee our business, among other things. We have seen increasing attention from regulators in this space, particularly with respect to provider network data integrity, and if we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of these delegated entities, we could be subject to additional risk. For additional information, see \u201c-We are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\u201d\nSome providers that render services to our members and insureds who have coverage for out-of-network services, or who obtain out-of-network emergency services, are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies. In certain cases, there is no pre-established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider; rather, the plan's obligation is to reimburse the provider based upon the terms of the member's plan or as otherwise required by law. The amount of provider reimbursement that a plan is obligated to pay in certain cases is established by a standard set forth in the plan that is not clearly translated into dollar terms, such as \u201cmaximum allowable amount\u201d or \u201cusual, customary and reasonable.\u201d However, in other instances such reimbursement requirements are defined by statute or regulation and such amounts may, in certain instances, be greater than those calculated according to the plan standards. These statutory requirements related to provider reimbursements may increase our health care costs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, providers who render out-of-network services may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member. Regulatory authorities in various states may also challenge the manner in which we reimburse members for services performed by non-contracted providers. As a result of litigation or regulatory activity, we may have to pay providers additional amounts or reimburse members for their out-of-pocket payments. The uncertainty about our financial obligations for such services and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of our original payments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPhysicians and other professional providers, provider groups and hospitals that contract with us have in certain situations commenced litigation and/or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts for which they allege we are liable, including amounts related to unpaid claims and amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us. We are currently a party to matters of this nature and could face additional claims or be subject to litigation and/or arbitration proceedings in the future in connection with similar matters. We believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals, including accounting firms and attorneys, in these efforts. These efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse general economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nAdverse general economic conditions could expose us to a number of risks, including risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers. In light of the substantial uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of the ACA and related state health care reform proposals, how the implementation of these new requirements will affect these risks remains unclear. If our customer base experiences cash flow problems or other financial difficulties, it could, in turn, adversely impact membership in our plans. For example, our customers could modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, or may make changes in the mix of products purchased from us. If our customers experience financial issues, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that are owed to us. Further, our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business, and in order to compete effectively in our markets, we also must deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers and that are designed and priced properly and competitively. A significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and/or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, particularly our individual customers on the exchanges, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our revenues, profitability and cash flow. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other providers and, as a result, could adversely affect our contracted rates with such parties and increase our medical costs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our Medi-Cal membership was approximately 1.6 million members, and it is expected to continue to increase in 2015 as a result of Medicaid expansion and our participation in the CCI. However, the State of California has experienced budget deficits in the recent past. Challenging economic conditions, another economic downturn or continued government efforts to contain medical costs and health care related expenditures could adversely affect state and federal budgets, including California's, resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government-funded health care coverage programs, including Medicare and Medi-Cal or reimbursements or payments in these programs that do not keep pace with our cost trends. Any future state budget difficulties may also threaten the ongoing viability of the CCI, as discussed further in the risk factor under the heading, \u201c-Our participation in the dual eligibles demonstration portion of the California Coordinated Care Initiative in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties may prove to be unsuccessful for a number of reasons.\u201d\nFor additional discussion on budget issues at the federal level and the potential risks to our business, see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-Government programs represent an increasing share of our revenues. If we are unable to\neffectively administer these programs, if we do not effectively adapt to changes to these programs, or if we experience a significant reduction in revenues from these government programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\u201d In addition, continued state and federal budgetary pressures could cause new or higher levels of assessments or taxes for our commercial programs, such as surcharges on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims or premium taxes on insurance companies and HMOs, and could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, any enrollment freeze or significant delay in reimbursement payment from government programs in which we participate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. For example, in the past, budget issues have led the State of California to delay certain of its monthly Medicaid payments to us. Any such irregularity in the timing of these payments in future periods may adversely impact our operating cash flow from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of such payments.\nWe must comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security, including requiring through contract that business associates that handle certain information on our behalf comply with relevant privacy and security requirements, including, but not limited to HIPAA.\nWe are subject to compliance obligations arising from laws and regulations governing certain Protected Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d) and Personal Information (\u201cPI\u201d) including but not limited to: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d) and their respective implementing regulations; the Federal Trade Commission Act; federal regulations governing substance abuse records; state privacy and security laws such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (\u201cCMIA\u201d) and the California Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCalOPPA\u201d); and state breach notification laws that require providing notification in the event of a breach of PI (such as Cal. Code \u00a7 1798.82). A variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws, including, but not limited to HHS, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), state attorneys general, and other state regulators. In addition, as our individual exchange business grows, we are increasingly impacted by requirements under the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities.\nHIPAA regulations, as amended, require health plans, clearinghouses and providers to, among other obligations: comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use, disclosure, storage, and transmission of PHI; adopt rigorous internal policies and procedures to safeguard PHI; and enter into specific written agreements with business associates that receive, transmit, use and/or create PHI on our behalf. HIPAA also established significant civil and criminal sanctions for violations. These regulations expose us to liability for, among other things, violations of the regulations by our business associates, including the third party vendors involved in our outsourcing projects. Other state and federal laws and regulations, including some of the laws noted above, impose similar privacy and security requirements.\nThe HITECH Act expanded HIPAA's requirements for security and privacy safeguards, including improved enforcement, additional limitations on use and disclosure of PHI and additional potential penalties for violations, and imposed notice obligations in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI.\nThe HITECH Act has been implemented on a rolling basis through subsequent rulemaking. On January 17, 2013, the Office of Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) of HHS issued the omnibus final rule on HIPAA privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement requirements under the HITECH Act, and a final regulation for required changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule for the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. The omnibus final rule became effective on March 26, 2013, with an applicable compliance date of September 23, 2013. Although our contracts with our business associates require business associates to maintain the privacy and security of PHI and PI that we disclose to them, we may have limited control over the actions and practices of our business associates. This risk increases as we contract with third parties for the performance of additional services on our behalf. Compliance with HIPAA and state and federal privacy and security laws and regulations has resulted in and may in the future result in significant costs to us due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by us or our business associates. If we or our business associates fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security, such as applicable contractual requirements or the requirements imposed through the laws and regulations referenced above, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected and our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIf we or our business associates that handle certain information on our behalf fail to comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security, among other things, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable information or data, including PHI and cardholder data, by our businesses are regulated at the federal and state levels, and in some cases are subject to contractual requirements. Despite the privacy and security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party vendors and service providers, are vulnerable to privacy and security incidents including, but not limited to, computer hacking, breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses or other forms of cyber-attack, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. For additional details on the types of information we process and store, and the applicable laws, rules and regulations see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-We must comply with requirements relating to patient privacy and information security, including requiring through contract that business associates that handle certain information on our behalf comply with relevant privacy and security requirements, including, but not limited to HIPAA.\u201d\nA party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent our security systems could, among other things, misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information (including but not limited to PHI, cardholder data and other member information), user information or other proprietary information, cause significant interruptions in our operations and cause all or portions of our website to be unavailable. Internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems, and we have in the past, and expect that we will in the future, experience external attacks on our network, such as, for example, reconnaissance probes, denial of service attempts, malicious software attacks and phishing attacks. We have expended significant resources to protect against such attacks, detect if and when attacks occur, respond to these attempted attacks and recover the enterprise to regular operations, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Any reductions in the availability of our website could impair our ability to conduct our business and adversely impact our members during the occurrence of any such incident.\nBecause the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations. Recent, well-publicized attacks on prominent companies, including in our industry, have resulted in the theft of significant amounts of sensitive and personal information and demonstrate the sophistication of the perpetrators and magnitude of the threat posed to companies across the nation, including the health care industry. In addition, in November 2014 we announced that we entered into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities, subject to regulatory approval of the transaction. The Cognizant transaction will require us to devote significant resources to transition from our existing systems infrastructure and relocate to a new data center, and if we are unable to successfully execute and manage this transition, the movement of data during the transition may enhance the information management and data security risks we currently face. For additional details on the Cognizant transaction and associated risks, see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-We are subject to a number of risks in connection with our decision to enter into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities.\u201d\nNoncompliance with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us, one of our business associates or another third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages; litigation; consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices; requirements that we provide notices, credit monitoring services and/or credit restoration services or other relevant services to impacted individuals; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief. Additionally, the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial.\nIf we fail to effectively maintain our information management systems, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends significantly on effective and efficient information systems. The information gathered and processed by our information management systems assists us in, among other things, pricing our services, monitoring utilization and other cost factors, processing provider claims, billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection. Our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification, claims status and other information. We have different information systems for our various businesses and\nthese systems require the commitment of significant resources for continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and evolving industry and regulatory standards. We have partnered with third parties to support our information technology systems and to help design, build, test, implement and maintain our information management systems. Additionally, in November 2014 we announced that we entered into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology activities, which would significantly increase the scope of services provided to us by third parties in this regard, subject to regulatory approval of the transaction. Our merger, acquisition and divestiture activity also requires transitions to or from, and the integration of, various information management systems within our overall enterprise architecture.\nWe are in the process of reducing the number of systems that we operate. Any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems, including in connection with the decommissioning of a system or the implementation of a new system; any inability or failure to properly maintain information management systems; any failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems, including to renew technology, maintain technology currency, keep pace with evolving industry standards or eliminate redundant or obsolete applications; or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs, could result in operational disruptions, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, disputes with customers and providers, regulatory or other legal or compliance problems, significant increases in administrative expenses and/or other adverse consequences. If for any reason there is a business continuity interruption resulting in loss of access to or availability of data, we may, among other things, not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be adversely impacted. In addition, we currently obtain, and subject to regulatory approval, expect to obtain in the future, significant portions of our systems-related and other services and facilities, including our data center, from independent third parties. This makes our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately. See \u201c-We are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\u201d\nIn addition, the Cognizant transaction will require us to devote significant resources to transition from our existing systems infrastructure and relocate to a new data center, and if we are unable to successfully execute and manage this transition, the movement of data during the transition may enhance several of the information management and data security risks we currently face. For additional details on the Cognizant transaction and associated risks, see the risk factor under the heading \u201c-We are subject to a number of risks in connection with our decision to enter into a master services agreement with Cognizant for the performance of a significant portion of our business process and information technology activities.\u201d\nWe also face challenges with respect to our implementation and support of the requirements of the ACA. Because federal and state regulators continue to release new and revised final rules and regulations relating to the implementation of the ACA, there remains substantial uncertainty with respect to these requirements, including, but not limited to rules and regulations related to the state-based and federally facilitated exchanges, the assessment and collection of the health insurer fee and the reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridors programs. Among other things, we have been required to define and implement new billing and payment capabilities and support new requests from third parties and government agencies for data collection and reporting. These additional demands have required and are continuing to require us to make significant systems changes, including developing, investing in, configuring, installing and monitoring the performance of new products and technology. The implementation of these changes has required and will continue to require the expenditure of material resources. See the ACA Risk Factors for further information regarding the ACA and the challenges we continue to face in implementing its provisions.\nCMS adopted a new coding set for diagnoses, commonly referred to as ICD-10, which significantly expands the number of codes utilized. The new ICD-10 coding set is currently required to be implemented by October 2015. We will be required to incur additional expenses to implement and support the new ICD-10 coding set. If we have not adequately implemented the requirements of the ACA and ICD-10 within the time period required, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nAs the requirements of supporting our businesses evolve over time, including as a result of the ACA's dynamic marketplace and in connection with the Cognizant transaction, there can be no assurances that we will be able to make the necessary systems changes or other modifications necessary to successfully meet such demands. If we do not successfully respond to such demands in a timely manner, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness, or need to refinance existing indebtedness, in the future, which may adversely affect our operations.\nOur indebtedness includes $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2017. Our Senior Notes payable balance was $399.5 million as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we have a $600 million five-year revolving credit facility that expires in October 2016. As of December 31, 2014, we had $100.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility. For a description of our Senior Notes and our revolving credit facility, see \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Structure.\u201d We may incur additional debt in the future. Our existing indebtedness, and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce funds available to fund stock repurchases, working capital, capital expenditures and other general operating requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWe continually evaluate options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to obtain any financing, whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise, and the terms of any such financing are dependent on, among other things, our financial condition, financial market conditions within our industry and generally, credit ratings and numerous other factors. In the event we need to access the credit markets, including to refinance our debt, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could, in addition to other negative effects, have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements.\nDowngrades in our debt ratings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by nationally recognized ratings agencies are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and managed care companies. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings also are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. In addition, our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Rating agencies review our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's independent opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders and other factors, and are subject to change. Potential downgrades from ratings agencies, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital.\nAs a holding company, our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends, in part, on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries' ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings, business and tax considerations, legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions. Under California\u2019s Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as amended (also known as the Knox-Keene Act), our subsidiaries that are licensed under the Knox-Keene Act must comply with certain minimum capital or tangible net equity (\u201cTNE\u201d) requirements ranging up to 130% of a specified minimum TNE for larger and older licensees such as Health Net of California. In addition, each of our subsidiaries regulated under the Knox-Keene Act have agreed to certain undertakings to the Department of Managed Health Care, restricting dividends and loans to affiliates, to the extent that the payment of such would reduce its TNE below 130% of the minimum requirement. In addition, in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements, known as RBC. These laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Failure to maintain the minimum RBC standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including increased reporting and/or state supervision. In addition, in most states, we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay\ndividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts as determined by the state\u2019s formula. If our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us, it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and free cash flow. For additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries' statutory capital requirements, see \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Statutory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nThe value of our intangible assets may become impaired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $570.7 million as of December 31, 2014, representing approximately 11 percent of our total assets and 33 percent of our consolidated stockholders' equity at December 31, 2014.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to income may be necessary. This impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding estimated fair value including assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives, long-term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting processes, as well as the expected weighted average cost of capital used in the discount process. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets, we may be required to record impairment losses against income. Any future evaluations resulting in an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially impact our results of operations and stockholders' equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in stockholders' equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.\nFrom time to time, we divest assets or businesses that we believe are less of a strategic fit for the company or do not produce an adequate return. Any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Critical Accounting Estimates-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d for further discussion of our procedures related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe value of our investment portfolio and our goodwill could be adversely impacted by varying economic and market conditions which could, in turn, have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders' equity.\nOur investment portfolio is comprised primarily of available-for-sale investment securities such as interest-yielding debt securities of varying maturities. As of December 31, 2014, our available-for-sale investment securities were approximately $1.8 billion. The value of fixed-income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short- and long-term interest rates, with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease. These securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market. We closely monitor the fair values of our investment securities and regularly evaluate them for any other-than-temporary impairments. We have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amount invested.\nThe current economic environment and the volatility of capital markets could negatively impact the liquidity of investments, such as the debt securities we hold, and a worsening in these markets could have negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets. In addition, such uncertainty has increased the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets.\nOver time, the economic and capital market environment may decline or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding the impairment of certain investments. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. There is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information regarding our investment portfolio.\nIn addition, our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries' portfolios. There can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, illiquidity or otherwise, could have a negative effect on our stockholders' equity. In addition, if it became\nnecessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our stock price experiences significant fluctuations or if our market capitalization materially declines, we could be required to take an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill. If we were required to take such a charge, it would be non-cash and would not affect our liquidity or financial condition, but could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge was taken.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility, and, although the price of our common stock rose significantly in 2014, it has shown significant volatility in years past. In 2012, the per share value of our common stock decreased by 20.1%. In 2013, the per share value of our common stock increased by 21.8%, and in 2014, the per share value of our common stock increased by 82.3%. There can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will vary in a manner consistent with the variation in the Standard & Poor's 400 Mid-Cap Index of which our common stock is a component. The market prices of our common stock and the securities of certain other publicly-traded companies in our industry have in the past or may in the future show significant volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors, including, without limitation, the ACA and health care reform generally, public communications regarding managed care, legislative or regulatory actions, political developments, developments in connection with our master services agreement with Cognizant, litigation or threatened litigation, health care cost trends, proposed premium increases, pricing trends, reductions in government reimbursement, competition, earnings, proposed changes in or the introduction of new government programs or initiatives, developments with respect to the CCI, receivable collections or membership reports of particular industry participants, and market speculation about or actual merger and acquisition activity. Additionally, adverse developments affecting any one of the companies in our sector could cause the price of our common stock to weaken, even if those adverse developments do not otherwise affect us. There can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price.\nSecurities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nNegative publicity regarding the managed health care industry and health care reform could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services.\nManaged health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. For example, the Company and the managed health care industry have been subject to negative publicity surrounding premium rate increases and government investigations into the industry and our own business practices. Such risks may be exacerbated in the event we and other companies in our industry raise premium rates by more than has been done in recent years to price for the expanded benefits required by, and the fees, taxes and assessments imposed by, the ACA or to respond to any increase in medical cost trends. In addition, health care, health care reform and its implementation and related health care reform proposals have been and are expected to continue to be the subject of intense media attention and political debate. Such political discourse can often generate publicity that portrays managed care in a negative light. Our marketing efforts may be affected by, among other things, the amount of negative publicity to which the industry has been subject, as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry. Speculation, uncertainty or negative publicity about us, our industry, our third party vendors or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services, require changes to our products or services, or stimulate additional legislation, regulation, review of our practices or those of the industry or litigation that could adversely affect us.\nManaging executive succession and retention is critical to our success. If we are unable to manage the succession of our key executives, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on retaining existing key executives and attracting additional qualified executives to meet current and future needs. We face intense competition for qualified executives, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such executives. Although we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with our key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to attract and retain suitable successors. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team.\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business.\nWe continue to evaluate the profitability realized or that we expect to be realized by our existing businesses and operations. From time to time we review, from a strategic standpoint, potential acquisitions and divestitures in light of our core businesses and growth strategies. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. For divestitures, success may also be dependent upon efficiently reducing general and administrative or other functions for our remaining operations. In the event the structure of the transaction results in continuing obligations by the buyer to us or our customers, a buyer's inability to fulfill these obligations could lead to future financial loss on our part. As a seller, we may have significant continuing indemnification, administrative services or other obligations to the buyer. Potential acquisitions or divestitures present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, significant post-closing obligations, increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur $600 million revolving credit facility due in October 2016 requires us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make investments or other restricted payments, sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities. Our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Structure-Revolving Credit Facility\u201d for further details regarding our revolving credit facility.\nThe restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies. In addition, any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and, in some circumstances, under the indenture governing our Senior Notes, which, in any case, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our ability to recruit, manage, enable and retain a skilled and talented workforce.\nOur products and services and our operations require a large number of employees. As of December 31, 2014, we employed 7,922 individuals on a full-time basis and 92 individuals on a part-time or temporary basis. It is critical that we recruit, manage, enable and retain talent to successfully execute our strategic objectives, which requires aligned policies, a positive work environment and a robust succession and talent development process. Further, particularly in light of the changing health care environment, we must focus on building employee capabilities to help ensure that we can meet upcoming challenges and opportunities. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit, manage, enable and retain talent and meet upcoming challenges and opportunities. In addition, the impact of the external or internal environment or other factors on employee morale, enablement and engagement could also significantly impact the success of the Company.\nOur forecasts and other forward-looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties. Our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward-looking statements.\nFrom time to time in press releases and otherwise, we publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our future results, including estimated revenues, net earnings and other operating and financial metrics. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and, as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect.\nThe achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors, including those described in this report, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the uncertainties associated with federal and state health care reform, challenging economic conditions and our potential participation in new government programs or the provision of new services and/or benefits to new populations, among other things, may make it particularly difficult to forecast\nour future performance. As a result, we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information affecting us, our services, and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward-looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which could decrease the value of your shares of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These provisions may prohibit stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. In addition, federal antitrust laws apply to us, and any change in control of our state health plans or health insurance companies also would require the approvals of the applicable regulatory agencies in each state in which we operate.\nIn addition to the Rights Agreement, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of the Company that our stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nLarge-scale public health epidemics and/or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn outbreak of a pandemic disease and/or future terrorist activities, including bio-terrorism, could materially and adversely affect the U.S. economy in general and the health care industry specifically. Depending on the government's actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies, a large-scale public health epidemic or future acts of bio-terrorism could lead to, among other things, increased utilization of health care services and the associated increased health care costs due to increased in-patient and out-patient hospital costs, disruption of information and payment systems and the cost of any anti-viral or other medication used to treat affected people.\nDisasters, including earthquakes, fires and floods, could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power losses, virus outbreaks, telecommunications failures, break-ins or similar events could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations, result in loss of data, and/or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers. We have in place a disaster recovery plan that is intended to provide us with the ability to recover our critical information technology systems in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor. We also have business continuity plans that provide for the processes and resources necessary to operate during and following a disaster. However, there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster. Any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the agreements that govern the Northeast Sale, we have retained responsibility for certain liabilities of the acquired business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the Stock Purchase Agreement for the Northeast Sale, we are required to indemnify the Buyer and its affiliates for all pre-closing liabilities of the acquired business and for a broad range of excluded liabilities, including liabilities arising out of the acquired business incurred through the winding-up and running-out period of the acquired business. The Stock Purchase Agreement does not limit the amount or duration of our obligations to the Buyer and its affiliates with respect to these indemnities. As a result, in the event that the amount of these liabilities was to exceed our expectations, we could be responsible to the Buyer and its affiliates for substantial indemnification obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include:\n\u2022\nany requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles;\n\u2022\na significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nour inability to convert to international financial reporting standards, if required;\n\u2022\nfailure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies, including data security;\n\u2022\nprovider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers;\n\u2022\nfailure to protect our proprietary information; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our corporate governance policies or procedures.", "PERMNO": 76697, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "HNT"}
