{"cik": "95552", "company": "SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements, which may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7. \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\")\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks and uncertainties. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. Discussion about the important operational risks that our business encounters can also be found in the MD&A section and in the business description in Item 1, \"Business\" of this Annual Report. Below, we have described our present view of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently do not consider significant, could also potentially impair our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our reactions to these risks and uncertainties as well as our competitors' reactions will affect our future operating results.\nRisks Relating To Our Company\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and volatility in the automotive industry could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe majority of our sales are made in domestic U.S. markets and almost exclusively within North America. Therefore, our financial performance depends largely on conditions in the U.S. automotive industry, which in turn can be affected significantly by broad economic and financial market conditions. Consumer demand for automobiles is subject to considerable volatility as a result of consumer confidence in general economic conditions, levels of employment, prevailing wages, fuel prices and the availability and cost of consumer credit. With steady improvement in the North American automotive industry since the global recession that began in 2008, vehicle production levels in 2016 reached the highest level in the last decade. However, there can be no guarantee that the improvements in recent years will be sustained or that reductions from current production levels will not occur in future periods. Demand for aluminum wheels can be further affected by other factors, including pricing and performance comparisons to competitive materials such as steel. Finally, the demand for our products is influenced by shifts of market share between vehicle manufacturers and the specific market penetration of individual vehicle platforms being sold by our customers.\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our sales. The loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand could adversely affect our operating results.\nFord, GM, Toyota and FCA, together, represented approximately 88 percent of our total sales in 2016. Our OEM customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Increasingly global procurement practices, the pace of new vehicle introduction and demand for price reductions may make it more difficult to maintain long-term supply arrangements with our customers, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to negotiate supply arrangements with our customers on terms acceptable to us in the future. The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers provide that we will manufacture wheels for a particular vehicle model, rather than manufacture a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model (usually three to five years), typically are non-exclusive and do not require the purchase by the customer of any minimum number of wheels from us. Therefore, a significant decrease in consumer demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or a decision by a manufacturer not to purchase from us, or to discontinue purchasing from us, for a particular model or group of models, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe automotive component supply industry is highly competitive, both domestically and internationally. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price, technology, quality, delivery and overall customer service and available capacity to meet customer demands. Some of our competitors are companies, or divisions or subsidiaries of companies, which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We cannot ensure that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these competitors. In particular, our ability to increase manufacturing capacity typically requires significant investments in facilities, equipment and personnel. Our operating facilities are at full or near to full capacity levels which may cause us to incur labor costs at premium rates in order to meet customer requirements, experience increased maintenance expenses or require us to replace our machinery and equipment on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted new entrants, particularly from low cost countries. As a result, our sales levels and margins continue to be adversely affected by pricing pressures reflective of significant competition from producers located in low-cost foreign markets, such as China. Such competition with lower-cost structures poses a significant threat to our ability to compete internationally and domestically. These factors have led to our customers awarding business to foreign competitors in the past, and they may continue to do so in the future. In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to\nnew technologies or evolving customer requirements. Consequently, our products may not be able to compete successfully with competitors' products.\nWe experience continual pressure to reduce costs.\nThe vehicle market is highly competitive at the OEM level, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. Customer concentration, relative supplier fragmentation and product commoditization have translated into continual pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margin, rate of profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in OEMs' purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business. Our OEM customers typically attempt to qualify more than one wheel supplier for the programs we participate in and for programs we may bid on in the future. As such, our OEM customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing or may decrease sales volume. Such actions may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions for our company, resulting in lower revenues, gross profit, operating income and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement cost-saving measures or achieve expected benefits under our plans to improve operations.\nAs part of our ongoing focus to provide high quality products, we continually analyze our business to further improve our operations and identify cost-cutting measures. We may be unable to successfully identify or implement plans targeting these initiatives, or fail to realize the benefits of the plans we have already implemented, as a result of operational difficulties, a weakening of the economy or other factors. Cost reductions may not fully offset decreases in the prices of our products due to the time required to develop and implement cost reduction initiatives. Additional factors such as inconsistent customer ordering patterns, increasing product complexity and heightened quality standards are making it increasingly more difficult to reduce our costs. It is possible that as we incur costs to implement improvement strategies, the impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow may be negative.\nInterruption in our production capabilities could result in increased freight costs or contract cancellations.\nIn the last six months of 2016, we experienced significant operating inefficiencies primarily in one of our manufacturing facilities. The inefficiencies stemmed from a variety of issues that reduced production rates. Contributing factors to the inefficiencies included an electricity outage and unanticipated equipment reliability issues which reduced finished goods and work-in-process inventories. We also experienced several new product launches and significant ramp-up in demand for newer products for which unusually high scrap rates were occurring. Lower than normal production yields coupled with the loss of inventory safety stock resulted in a series of expedited shipments to customers. The higher than normal costs included approximately $13 million in freight expediting costs and additional costs related to the production inefficiencies.\nAn interruption in production capabilities at any of our facilities as a result of equipment failure, interruption of raw materials or other supplies, labor disputes or other reasons could result in our inability to produce our products, which would reduce our sales and operating results for the affected period and harm our customer relationships. We have, from time to time, undertaken significant re-tooling and modernization initiatives at our facilities, which in the past have caused, and in the future may cause, unexpected delays and plant underutilization, and such adverse consequences may continue to occur as we continue to modernize our production facilities. In addition, we generally deliver our products only after receiving the order from the customer and thus typically do not hold large inventories. In the event of a production interruption at any of our manufacturing facilities, even if only temporary, or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control, delivery times to our customers could be severely affected. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to premium freight costs and other performance penalties, as well as contract cancellations, and cause us to lose future sales and expose us to other claims for damages. Our manufacturing facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or violent weather conditions. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nSimilarly, it also is possible that our customers may experience production delays or disruptions for a variety of reasons, which could include supply-chain disruption for parts other than wheels, equipment breakdowns or other events affecting vehicle assembly rates that impact us, work stoppages or slow-downs at factories where our products are consumed, or even catastrophic events such as fires, disruptive weather conditions or natural disasters. Such disruptions at the customer level may cause the affected customer to halt or limit the purchase of our products.\nWe may be unable to successfully launch new products and/or achieve technological advances.\nIn order to effectively compete in the automotive supply industry, we must be able to launch new products and adopt technology to meet our customers' demand in a timely manner. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed for new product programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, we cannot ensure that our customers will execute the launch of their new product programs on schedule. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. Further, changes in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. Our failure to successfully and timely launch new products or adopt new technologies, or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs, could adversely affect our results. We cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products will not become obsolete.\nOur international operations and international trade agreements make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture a substantial portion of our products in Mexico, have a minor investment in a wheel manufacturing company in India and we sell our products internationally. Accordingly, unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures, trade protection laws, regulations and policies affecting trade and investments and social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region, among other factors, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.\nChanges in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently develop and sell products could adversely affect our business. A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in Mexico. New leadership in the U.S. federal government is not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). If the U.S. withdraws from or materially modifies NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Proposals to institute a border adjustment of 20% for imports could have a negative impact on our operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies may adversely impact our financial condition.\nDue to the growth of our operations outside of the U.S., we have experienced increased exposure to foreign currency gains and losses in the ordinary course of our business. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso and any currencies of other countries in which we conduct our business may have a material impact on our financial condition, as cash flows generated in foreign currencies may be used, in part, to service our U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities, or vice versa.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the value of our foreign assets as reported in U.S. dollars, and may adversely affect reported earnings and, accordingly, the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. We cannot ensure that fluctuations in exchange rates will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.\nOur business requires us to settle transactions between currencies in both directions - i.e., peso to U.S. dollar and vice versa. To the greatest extent possible, we attempt to match the timing of transaction settlements between currencies to create a \u201cnatural hedge.\u201d Based on the current business model and levels of production and sales activity, the net imbalance between currencies depends on specific circumstances. While changes in the terms of the contracts with our customers will be creating an imbalance between currencies that we are hedging with foreign currency forward contracts, there can be no assurances that our hedging program will effectively offset the impact of the imbalance between currencies or that the net transaction balance will not change significantly in the future.\nTo manage this risk, we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted\nfuture cash flows. We have a program to hedge a portion of our material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 36 months. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There is no guarantee that our hedge program will effectively mitigate our exposures to foreign exchange changes which could have material adverse effects on our cash flows and results of operations.\nIncreases in the costs and restrictions on availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow.\nGenerally, we obtain our raw materials, supplies and energy requirements from various sources. Although we currently maintain alternative sources, our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials may be driven by the supply/demand relationship for that commodity or governmental regulation. In addition, if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated, the availability or price of raw materials could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are able to periodically pass certain aluminum cost increases on to our customers, we may not be able to pass along all changes in aluminum costs, or there may be a delay in passing the aluminum costs onto our customers. Our customers are not obligated to accept energy or other supply cost increases that we may attempt to pass along to them. This inability to pass on these cost increases to our customers could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow, possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability.\nAluminum and alloy pricing may have a material effect on our operating margins and results of operations.\nThe cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel and in our selling prices to OEM customers. The price for aluminum we purchase is adjusted monthly based primarily on changes in certain published market indices, but the timing of such adjustments is based on specific customer agreements and can vary from monthly to quarterly. As a result, the timing of aluminum price adjustments flowing through sales rarely will match the timing of such changes in cost and can result in fluctuations to our gross profit. This is especially true during periods of frequent increases or decreases in the market price of aluminum.\nThe aluminum we use to manufacture wheels also contains additional alloying materials, including silicon. The cost of alloying materials also is a component of the overall cost of a wheel. The price of the alloys we purchase is also based on certain published market indices; however, most of our customer agreements do not provide price adjustments for changes in market prices of alloying materials. Increases or decreases in the market prices of these alloying materials could have a material effect on our operating margins and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws.\nWe incur significant costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot ensure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. Failure to be in compliance with such laws and regulations could result in material fines or sanctions. Additionally, changes to such laws or regulations may have a significant impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes and the health and safety of our employees. The nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health. In addition, some of our properties are subject to indemnification and/or cleanup obligations of third parties with respect to environmental matters. However, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of such third parties, we could be required to bear the liabilities that would otherwise be the responsibility of such third parties.\nFurther, changes in legislation or regulation imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, or otherwise impacting or limiting our equipment and operations or from the vehicles that use our products could adversely affect demand for those vehicles or require us to incur costs to become compliant with such regulations.\nWe are from time to time subject to litigation, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We are exposed to potential product liability and warranty risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of automotive products, the failure of which could\nresult in property damage, personal injury or death. Accordingly, individual or class action suits alleging product liability or warranty claims could result. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot give assurance that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be unsuccessful in replacing key managers who either resign or retire. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience reduced net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations, internal control over financial reporting or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Many of our key controls rely on maintaining personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. in order to operate effectively. Material weaknesses or deficiencies may cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements, unintentional errors, or omissions, and late filings with regulatory agencies may occur.\nOur share repurchase program may limit our flexibility to pursue other initiatives.\nAlthough our existing cash and funds available under our senior secured credit facility are currently adequate to fund our approved common stock repurchase plan, dedication of our financial resources to the repurchase of outstanding shares will reduce our liquidity and working capital, which in turn may limit our flexibility to pursue other initiatives to grow our business or to return capital to our shareholders through other means. After making such expenditures, a significant change in our business, the economy or an unexpected decrease in our cash flow for any reason could result in the need for additional outside financing.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology (\"IT\") security systems causing an IT security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IT business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in adverse consequences to our business, including: an adverse impact on our operations due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of IT systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities, an inability to timely prepare and file our financial reports with the Securities Exchange Commission and negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.\nWe may be unable to successfully achieve expected benefits from our joint ventures or acquisitions.\nAs we continue to expand globally, we have engaged, and may continue to engage, in joint ventures and we may pursue acquisitions that involve potential risks, including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such joint ventures or acquisitions. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge, and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully. Failure to successfully integrate operations or to realize the expected benefits of such joint ventures or acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"). Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our consolidated financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.", "PERMNO": 52396, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SUP"}
