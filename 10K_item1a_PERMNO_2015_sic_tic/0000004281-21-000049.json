{"cik": "4281", "company": "Howmet Aerospace Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nHowmet\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Howmet or that Howmet currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases, public health epidemics or pandemics and other adverse public health developments in countries where we, our employees, customers and suppliers operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the global community, including the United States, Europe and South America, is adversely impacting our operations, and the nature and extent of the impact over time is highly uncertain and beyond our control. The extent to which COVID-19 further affects our operations over time will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the duration of the pandemic, the continued severity of the virus, resurgences and emergence of variants of the virus, the efficacy and availability of vaccines, and the extent of actions that may be taken to contain its impact. These actions include, but are not limited to, declarations of states of emergency, business closures, manufacturing restrictions and a prolonged period of travel, commercial and/or other similar restrictions and limitations, many of which have been implemented across much of the globe and all of which have negatively affected our business. The longer the duration, the greater the impact on our business and the more heightened the risk of a continuing material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or cash flows, as well as on our business strategies and initiatives. We continue to monitor guidelines proposed by federal, state and local, as well as foreign, governments with respect to measures for continued operation, which may change over time depending on public health, safety and other considerations. We are continuing to focus on the safety and protection of our workforce by continuing to implement additional safety protocols in light of COVID-19.\nAs a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain its spread, our global sales, including to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries that are impacted by COVID-19, have been and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted due to the disruption in demand, which has had and over time could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below:\n\u2022Business and operations risks: We continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to COVID-19 to determine whether we will need to significantly modify our business practices or take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. We have had a number of smaller manufacturing locations that have experienced periods of shutdowns. Future shutdowns will be dependent on facts and circumstances as they unfold, including based on the restrictions and limitations noted above. Additional shutdowns, while not required by governmental authorities, may be necessary to match our production to the reduced demand of our customers. In addition, due to the foregoing factors and potential further disruptions, we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase. We may also face challenges in restoring our production levels if and when COVID-19 abates, including as a result of government-imposed or other limitations that prevent the return of all or a portion of our workforce, continue to disrupt demand and/or limit the capabilities of our suppliers. As a result of COVID-19 and its potential impact on the aerospace industry, the possibility exists that a sustained impact to our operations, financial results and market capitalization may require material impairments of our assets, including, but not limited to, goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets, and right-of-use assets. While we have already implemented plans to reduce costs, including certain headcount reductions, reductions in certain cash outflows, suspension of our common stock dividend and reductions in the levels of our capital expenditures, the longer-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, but could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\n\u2022Customer and supplier risks: We have limited visibility into future demand due to the disruptions resulting from COVID-19. The sharp decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that governments and private organizations worldwide have implemented in an attempt to contain its spread is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, airlines and airframers and their respective demand for our customers\u2019 products and services. Aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and, as a result, demand for products in the OEM market has significantly decreased. Several of our aerospace and commercial transportation customers temporarily suspended operations at certain production sites,\nreduced operations and production rates, and/or took cost-cutting actions, including, but not limited to, General Electric Company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation and The Boeing Company, which represented approximately 11%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our third-party sales in 2020. Due to the foregoing factors and other cost-cutting measures, we are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products, customer requests for potential payment deferrals, pricing concessions or other contract modifications, and delays in deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones. COVID-19 may also limit the ability of our counterparties generally to perform their obligations to us, including, but not limited to, our customers\u2019 ability to make timely payments to us. These trends may lead to charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts over time, as noted above, as we have historically depended upon the strength of these industries, particularly the commercial aerospace industry. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact customer contract negotiations, including the ability to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations and our ability to obtain new customers. Similarly, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. To date, we have not experienced significant disruption to our supply chain. If our suppliers\u2019 operations were to be impacted, we may need to seek alternate suppliers, which may be more expensive, may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers, each of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The duration of the current disruptions to our customers and to our supply chain, and related financial impact to us, cannot be estimated at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Ultimately, the demand for our products is, in turn, driven by demand for transportation and for people to travel within and between various countries. Should the COVID-19 pandemic cause a long-term deterioration in demand for transportation or travel due to fear or anxiety related to health concerns, governmental restriction, economic hardships, or increased use of electronic communication technologies embraced during the COVID-19 related shutdowns, the effects on our business may extend well beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis and immediate related governmental actions.\n\u2022Market risks: The current financial market dynamics and volatility pose heightened risks to our liquidity. For example, dramatically lower interest rates and lower expected asset valuations and returns can materially impact the calculation of long-term liabilities such as our pension. In addition, extreme volatility in financial markets has had and may continue to have adverse impacts on other asset valuations such as the value of the investment portfolios supporting our pension. Our long-term liabilities are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that can move in offsetting directions and should be considered as of the time of a relevant measurement event.\n\u2022Liquidity and credit risks: We currently have the ability to borrow up to $1.0 billion under our Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which was amended in June 2020. A prolonged period of generating lower financial results and cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition, including in respect of satisfying both required and voluntary pension funding requirements, could result in potential increases in net debt or reductions in EBITDA, and could otherwise negatively affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. If the foregoing or other factors negatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the Credit Agreement, our ability to draw under the Credit Agreement would be adversely affected. There can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades as a result of weaker than anticipated performance of our business or other factors, including overall market conditions. Rating downgrades could further adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our business. Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding (including for receivables securitization or supply chain finance programs used to finance working capital) or our ability to refinance certain of our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Although the U.S. federal and other governments have announced a number of funding programs to support businesses, our ability or willingness to access funding under such programs may be limited by regulations or other guidance, including eligibility criteria, or by further change or uncertainty related to the terms of these programs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed herein, including, but not limited to, risks related to global economic conditions, competition, loss of customers, costs of supplies, manufacturing difficulties and disruptions, investment returns, our credit profile, our credit ratings and interest rates. We expect that the longer the period of disruption from COVID-19 continues, the more material the adverse impact will be on our business operations, financial performance, results of operations and/or cash flows. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or cash flows.\nThe markets for Howmet\u2019s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors, including global economic conditions.\nHowmet is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. Howmet sells many products to industries that are cyclical, such as the aerospace and commercial transportation industries, and the demand for its products is sensitive to, and quickly impacted by, demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries, which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies, currency exchange rates, energy prices or other factors beyond its control.\nIn particular, Howmet derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy. The commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft and spare parts. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs. Demand for commercial aircraft and spare parts is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S., regional and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators, the retirement of older aircraft, the performance and cost of alternative materials, and technological improvements to aircraft. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; however, it is also driven by the effects of terrorism, a changing global geopolitical environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older military aircraft, and technological improvements to new engines.\nFurther, the demand for Howmet\u2019s commercial transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by commercial transportation and automotive manufacturers. Commercial transportation and automotive sales and production are affected by many factors, including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements and levels of competition. The automotive industry is also sensitive to general economic conditions, including credit markets and interest rates, and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage, vehicle size, configuration and features.\nHowmet is unable to predict the future course of industry variables, the strength of the U.S., regional or global economies, or the effects of government actions. Negative economic conditions, such as a major economic downturn, a prolonged recovery period, or disruptions in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHowmet could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s reputation, business and financial statements.\nThe manufacture of many of Howmet\u2019s products is a highly exacting and complex process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols, specifications and procedures, including those related to quality or safety, problems with raw materials, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, labor unrest and environmental factors. Such problems could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance. Product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls, customer penalties, contract cancellation and product liability exposure. Because of approval, license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers and/or their suppliers, alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to Howmet or its customers. Accordingly, manufacturing problems, product defects or other risks associated with our products, could result in significant costs to and liability for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages, fines or penalties, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.\nA material disruption of Howmet\u2019s operations, particularly at one or more of its manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business.\nIf Howmet\u2019s operations, particularly one of its key manufacturing facilities, were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, theft, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes or other reasons, Howmet may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s financial performance.\nInterruptions in production could increase Howmet\u2019s costs and reduce its sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to incur costs for premium freight, make substantial capital expenditures, or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders, which could negatively affect Howmet\u2019s profitability and financial condition. Furthermore, a delivery delay by us due to production interruptions could subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer. Howmet maintains property damage insurance that the Company believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under Howmet\u2019s insurance policies may not offset the lost profits or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nInformation technology system failures, cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of Howmet\u2019s intellectual property and other sensitive information, disrupt its business operations, and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nHowmet relies on its information technology systems to manage and operate its business, process transactions, and summarize its operating results. Howmet\u2019s information technology systems could be subject to damage or interruption from power outages; computer, network and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism; and usage errors by employees. If Howmet\u2019s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and Howmet may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations. Any material disruption in the Company\u2019s information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHowmet also faces global cybersecurity threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company. Cyber attacks and security breaches may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other electronic security breaches.\nThe Company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves, the locations of its operations and its technological innovations. The Company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on Howmet\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nHowmet employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks, including technical security controls, data encryption, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, anti-virus software and frequent backups. Additionally, the Company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information, which includes training intended to prevent the success of \u201cphishing\u201d attacks. While the Company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use the Company\u2019s systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt its operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact Howmet\u2019s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources, and could result in the diminution of the value of the Company\u2019s investment in research and development.\nHowmet\u2019s enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from cyber attacks and security breaches. Howmet also maintains compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber attack or security breach.\nHowever, a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around the Company\u2019s cybersecurity environment may prevent Howmet from detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or the market price of its securities.\nHowmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial portion of raw materials essential to our operations, and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHowmet has supply arrangements with a limited number of suppliers for raw materials. We maintain annual or long-term contracts for a majority of our supply requirements, and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, or obtain replacements for, any of our long-term contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all.\nFrom time to time, increasing demand levels have caused regional supply constraints in the industry and further increases in demand levels could exacerbate these issues. Such constraints could impact our production or force us to purchase primary metal and other supplies from alternative sources, which may not be available in sufficient quantities or on terms that are favorable to us. Howmet could also have exposure if a key supplier is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis. In addition, a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key supplier exposes us to the risk of default by the supplier on its contractual agreement, and this risk is increased by weak and deteriorating economic conditions on a global, regional or industry sector level. Any of the foregoing supply chain disruptions or those due to capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, cyber attacks, delivery issues or disruptions due to weather-related, natural disaster, or pandemic events could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s operations and profitability.\nHowmet\u2019s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost or volatility in the availability of raw materials.\nHowmet may be adversely affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials (including, but not limited to, nickel, titanium, aluminum, cobalt, vanadium and platinum), as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of Howmet\u2019s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions, changes in geopolitical conditions or regulatory requirements (such as human rights regulations or environmental regulations), labor relations between the producers and their work forces, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, sanctions, new or increased import duties, countervailing or anti-dumping duties, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. In addition, from time to time, commodity prices may fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve, which may cause periodic supply interruptions. Howmet may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. Shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s operating results.\nHowmet could be adversely affected by the loss of key customers or significant changes in the business or financial condition of its customers.\nHowmet has long-term contracts with a significant number of its customers, some of which are subject to renewal, renegotiation or re-pricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions. Howmet\u2019s failure to successfully renew, renegotiate or favorably re-price such agreements, or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships, could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue.\nAdditionally, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by Howmet could affect Howmet\u2019s financial results. Howmet\u2019s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their businesses. For example, due to the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft by regulatory authorities in March 2019, Boeing suspended production of the aircraft in January 2020 and resumed low-rate production in May 2020, which has resulted in a reduction in the Company\u2019s sales. While regulatory authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions lifted grounding orders beginning in late 2020, our sales could continue to be negatively affected from the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding.\nHowmet\u2019s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with Howmet, including to reduce the amount of Howmet\u2019s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers. If Howmet\u2019s customers reduce, terminate or delay purchases from Howmet due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and Howmet is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nHowmet could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending.\nHowmet\u2019s products are used in a variety of military applications, including military aircraft. Although many of the programs in which Howmet participates extend several years, they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations. Changes in military strategy, policy and priorities, or reductions in defense spending, may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for Howmet\u2019s products, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHowmet may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business, or complete projects, at the levels, projected costs or by the dates targeted.\nFrom time to time, Howmet may announce future targets or goals for its business, including revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, restructuring plans, cost reductions and improvements in profitability. Future targets and goals reflect the Company\u2019s beliefs and assumptions and are based on the Company\u2019s then current expectations, its perception of historical trends, and estimates and projections about the environment, economies and markets in which Howmet operates, as well as other applicable factors. As such, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties regarding future events, including the risks discussed in this report. The actual outcome may be materially different. Failure by the Company to achieve the targets or goals at the levels or by the dates targeted, if at all, may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of its securities.\nIn addition, the implementation of Howmet\u2019s business strategy may involve the entry into and the execution of complex projects, which place significant demands on the Company\u2019s management and personnel, and may depend on numerous factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. There can be no assurance that such projects will be completed within budgeted costs, on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to the risks described in this report, or other factors. The failure to complete a material project as planned, or a significant delay in its execution, could have an adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHowmet faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability.\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1 (Business-Competitive Conditions) of this report, the markets for Howmet\u2019s products are highly competitive. Howmet\u2019s competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in our product markets. New product offerings, new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace Howmet products. The willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by Howmet, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for Howmet\u2019s products, and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting Howmet\u2019s competitors or customers could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, Howmet may face increased competition due to industry consolidation. As companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or merged. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of Howmet\u2019s business may acquire or form alliances with Howmet\u2019s competitors, thereby reducing their business with Howmet. Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. Consolidation within Howmet\u2019s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s profitability. Moreover, if, as a result of increased leverage, customers require Howmet to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished, Howmet could decide not to sell certain products to a particular customer, or not to sell certain products at all, which would decrease Howmet\u2019s revenue and could benefit its competitors. Consolidation within Howmet\u2019s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for Howmet\u2019s products if a combined entity replaces Howmet\u2019s products with those of Howmet\u2019s competitors with which it has prior relationships. The result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nHowmet may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully.\nHowmet\u2019s competitive position and future performance depends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in Howmet\u2019s end markets;\n\u2022identify and successfully execute on a strategy to remain an essential and sustainable element of our customers\u2019 supply chains;\n\u2022fund, develop, manufacture and bring innovative new products to market quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u2022monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers\u2019 and competitors\u2019 abilities to deploy such technologies; and\n\u2022achieve sufficient return on investment for new products based on capital expenditures and research and development spending.\nHowmet is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects, including advanced alloy development, engineered product design, and other advanced manufacturing technologies. While Howmet intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services, it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors, including those developing technology to displace Howmet\u2019s current products. In addition, Howmet may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages. There can be no assurance that any of Howmet\u2019s new products, development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or be beneficial to Howmet.\nHowmet\u2019s business depends, in part, on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations, reductions and delays.\nHowmet is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial, general aviation, military aircraft and aircraft engine programs. Many of these contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years. If Howmet fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, program cancellations, reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nProduct liability, product safety, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims and investigations may materially affect Howmet\u2019s financial condition and damage its reputation.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products expose Howmet to potential product liability, personal injury, property damage and related claims. These claims may arise from allegations of failure to meet product specifications, product design flaws and malfunction of products, as well as from misuse of our products, use of our products in an unintended, unapproved or unrecommended manner, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us. New data and information, including information about the ways in which Howmet\u2019s products are used, may lead Howmet, regulatory authorities, government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations, or impose restrictions, related to the manufacturing or use of Howmet\u2019s products.\nIn the event that a Howmet product fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, Howmet may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product. In addition, if a Howmet product is perceived to be defective or unsafe, Howmet\u2019s sales could decrease, its reputation could be adversely impacted and it could be subject to further liability claims. Moreover, events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose Howmet to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions.\nThere can be no assurance that Howmet will be successful in defending any such proceedings or that insurance available to Howmet will be sufficient to cover any losses associated with such proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could: (i) have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or profitability; (ii) impose substantial monetary damages and/or non-monetary penalties; (iii) result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations or other proceedings involving Howmet; (iv) result in loss of customers; (v) require changes to our products or business operations; or (vi) damage Howmet\u2019s reputation and/or negatively impact the market price of Howmet\u2019s common stock. Even if Howmet successfully defends against these types of claims, Howmet could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims; Howmet\u2019s management could be required to devote significant time, attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims and responding to these investigations; and Howmet\u2019s reputation could suffer. Product liability claims and related lawsuits and investigations, product recalls, and allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from sales to U.S. and foreign governments and their respective agencies, as a subcontractor of their prime contractors. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nHowmet\u2019s global operations expose Howmet to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the market price of its securities.\nHowmet has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the United States, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. As a result, Howmet\u2019s global operations are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which Howmet does business, as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, including:\n\u2022economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, such as those related to tariffs, sanctions and trade barriers (including tariffs imposed by the United States as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China or other foreign entities), taxation, data privacy, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of assets or earnings;\n\u2022geopolitical risks such as political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements;\n\u2022war, terrorist activities, kidnapping of personnel or other dangerous conditions;\n\u2022major public health issues, such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic (such as Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Influenza, H7N9 virus, coronavirus (including COVID-19), and the Ebola virus), which could cause disruptions in Howmet\u2019s operations, workforce, supply chain or end markets;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing contractual rights and intellectual property, including a lack of remedies for misappropriation in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022changes in trade and tax laws that may result in our customers being subjected to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and reduce their willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products;\n\u2022compliance with antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u2022rising labor costs or labor unrest, including strikes;\n\u2022compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements as compared to U.S. laws;\n\u2022aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by foreign governmental authorities;\n\u2022compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and corruption laws;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. laws concerning trade, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations, and the sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u2022imposition of currency controls; and\n\u2022adverse tax audit rulings.\nAlthough the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company\u2019s international operations subject Howmet to complex and dynamic laws and regulations that, in some cases, could result in conflict or inconsistency between applicable laws of different jurisdictions and/or legal obligations. While Howmet believes it has adopted appropriate risk management, compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the associated risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs, penalties, liabilities or other potential risks such as loss of export privileges or repatriation of assets that may arise from such events.\nHowmet may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business and competitive position.\nHowmet owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. The Company\u2019s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining Howmet\u2019s competitive position in a number of the markets that the Company serves. Howmet\u2019s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Howmet\u2019s proprietary technologies or design around the patents Howmet owns or licenses. Despite its controls and safeguards, Howmet\u2019s technology may be misappropriated by its employees, its competitors or other third parties. The pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of Howmet intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient. Further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of Howmet intellectual property increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against Howmet relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce Howmet\u2019s rights sufficiently, could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business and competitive position.\nHowmet may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in U.S. federal, state or foreign law, regulation or policy.\nHowmet\u2019s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or interpretations, or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Howmet. The Company may experience an unfavorable change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws, regulations or policies.\nHowmet is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks in the United States and abroad in connection with its business and products. These risks include, among other things, potential claims relating to product liability, product testing, health and safety, environmental matters, employment matters, required record keeping and record retention, compliance with securities laws, intellectual property rights, government contracts and taxes, insurance or commercial matters, as well as compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing import and export, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition, sales and trading practices, human rights and modern slavery, sourcing of raw materials, third-party relationships, supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products. Howmet may be a party to litigation in a foreign jurisdiction where geopolitical risks might influence the ultimate outcome of such litigation. Howmet could be subject to fines, penalties, damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.\nThe global and diverse nature of Howmet\u2019s operations means that these risks will continue to exist, and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time. While Howmet believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks, such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise. In addition, various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws, regulations or policies, or other contingencies that the Company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. Litigation and compliance efforts may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report and in Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nUnanticipated changes in Howmet\u2019s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect Howmet\u2019s future profitability.\nHowmet is subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect the Company\u2019s tax expense and profitability. Howmet\u2019s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. The assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The Company\u2019s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures.\nCorporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the United States and in many other jurisdictions. In particular, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Act\u201d) was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 Act. Those guidance projects, which include both Proposed and Final Treasury Regulations, continued into 2020. Howmet continues to review the ongoing interpretive guidance and evaluate its consequences. The ultimate impact of the 2017 Act may differ from reported amounts due to, among other things, changes resulting from such ongoing guidance. Further, we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Act or enact alternative legislation by the new presidential administration or Congress.\nLabor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of Howmet\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. For more information, see \u201cEmployees\u201d in Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this report. While Howmet previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions, Howmet may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at Howmet\u2019s facilities in the future. Howmet may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHowmet is subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.\nFailure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s business results.\nHowmet is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), state and local wage laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and regulations related to safety, discrimination, organizing, whistle-blowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments, citizenship requirements, and healthcare insurance mandates. Allegations that Howmet has violated such laws or regulations could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees, which could have a material adverse impact on Howmet\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nHowmet is exposed to environmental, health and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities.\nHowmet\u2019s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including present, past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that\ncaused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Environmental matters for which Howmet may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites, at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates, at sites that it may acquire in the future, or at third-party sites used by Howmet, its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including remediation obligations, may prove to be more challenging and costly than the Company anticipates. Howmet\u2019s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation and/or increased costs, including increased remediation costs, all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the industrial activities conducted at Howmet\u2019s facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees, customers or third parties that may be on site. We have experienced serious injuries in the past, notwithstanding the safety protocols, practices and precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies in the United States and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. From time to time, we have incurred fines for violations of various health and safety standards. In addition to industrial activities, the global COVID-19 pandemic will continue to significantly impact the health of our employees and increase the cost of health and safety measures within our operations. Significant community transmission in the vicinity of our operations is likely to impact the workforce availability due to quarantine and isolation practices. Social distancing, mask use, testing and other measures increase costs of operation. While we maintain insurance and have in place policies to minimize risks associated with industrial activities and COVID-19, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities relating to any injury, death or other workers compensation claims. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity and/or significant reputational harm.\nHowmet may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.\nIncreased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, such as cap-and-trade systems, additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) standards in the United States. New or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect Howmet and its customers and suppliers, including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company or its customers or suppliers. Also, Howmet relies on natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities. Any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the Company and its customers and suppliers, which could also have a negative impact on Howmet\u2019s profitability.\nPhysical risk associated with climate change may result in an increase of the exposure and impact of events with damage due to flooding, extreme winds and extreme precipitation for Howmet locations, suppliers or customers. Prolonged periods of drought may result in wildfires, which may have an adverse effect on production capacity of Howmet sites, suppliers and customers. While we maintain insurance coverage, these types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nA decline in Howmet\u2019s financial performance or outlook or a deterioration in its credit profile could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to capital markets, its liquidity and its borrowing costs.\nHowmet has significant capital requirements and depends, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic actions. A decline in the Company\u2019s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors could affect the Company\u2019s access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that Howmet will have access to the global capital market on terms the Company finds acceptable. Limitations on Howmet\u2019s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in the Company\u2019s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Howmet\u2019s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade of Howmet\u2019s credit ratings could limit its ability to obtain future financing, increase borrowing costs and costs relating to credit facilities, adversely affect the market price of Howmet securities, trigger collateral postings, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHowmet\u2019s credit ratings are important to the Company\u2019s cost of capital. The major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations, execution and timeliness of financial reporting. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings Howmet receives impact our borrowing costs\nas well as the terms upon which we will have access to capital. Failure to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position, and could also restrict our access to capital markets. For information on our credit ratings, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Part II, Item 7 (Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).\nThere can be no assurance that one or more of the credit rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to Howmet\u2019s ratings in the future. Increased debt levels, macroeconomic conditions, a deterioration in the Company\u2019s debt protection metrics, a contraction in the Company\u2019s liquidity, or other factors could potentially trigger such actions. A rating agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade of Howmet\u2019s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could result in adverse consequences, including: (i) adversely impact the market price of Howmet securities; (ii) adversely affect existing financing (for example, a downgrade by S&P or Moody\u2019s would subject Howmet to higher costs under the Credit Agreement); (iii) limit access to the capital (including commercial paper) or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all; (iv) result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the Company incurs; (v) increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities; or (vi) result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from Howmet.\nLimitations on Howmet\u2019s ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in Howmet\u2019s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect Howmet\u2019s ability to maintain or grow its business, which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nHowmet\u2019s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures.\nHowmet requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. Insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact Howmet\u2019s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and return-seeking capital projects. Over the long term, Howmet\u2019s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions, which could adversely affect the long-term value of its business and the Company\u2019s position in relation to its competitors.\nAn adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods.\nHowmet\u2019s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense Howmet records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors. Howmet calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").\nThese valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions used by Howmet to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Howmet is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant charge to shareholders\u2019 equity. For a discussion regarding how Howmet\u2019s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\u201d in Part II, Item 7 (Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities Howmet would contribute to the pension plans.\nPotential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans\u2019 funded status. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (\u201cMAP-21\u201d), enacted in 2012, provided temporary relief for employers like Howmet who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25-year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations. In 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (\"HATFA\") extended the relief provided by MAP-21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by MAP-21. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\"BBA 2015\") extended the relief period provided by HATFA. Howmet believes that the relief provided by BBA 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the Company\u2019s U.S. pension plans\u2019 funded status over the next several years due to recent and potential future declines in discount rates. However, higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans\u2019 funded status as a result of unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lower-than-expected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows. Adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the Company\u2019s liabilities related to such plans, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nHowmet is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation, economic factors, and currency controls in the countries in which it operates.\nEconomic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, competitive factors in the countries in which Howmet operates, and volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect Howmet\u2019s revenue, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, including the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan (renminbi), and Japanese yen, may affect Howmet\u2019s profitability.\nIn addition, a portion of Howmet\u2019s indebtedness, including borrowings, if any, under the Company\u2019s Five-Year Credit Facility, bears interest at rates equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Howmet\u2019s outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Accordingly, the Company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate. Further, LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include changes in the cost of Howmet\u2019s variable rate indebtedness.\nHowmet also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the Company\u2019s ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by Howmet\u2019s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. While Howmet currently has no need, and does not intend, to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, should the Company need to do so to fund its operations, it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs. Howmet currently has operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including China, and, if the Company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on Howmet\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nDividends and share repurchases fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors, depend on a number of factors, and are subject to limits under the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement.\nShare repurchases and the declaration of dividends fall within the discretion of Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Board\u2019s decision regarding such matters depends on many factors, including Howmet\u2019s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of the Company\u2019s debt obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the Board deems relevant. In addition, under the Company\u2019s amendment to the Credit Agreement, during the period from June 30, 2020 through December 31, 2021 (unless the Company ends this period earlier in accordance with the amendment or otherwise), common stock dividends and share repurchases are permitted only if no borrowings are outstanding under the Credit Agreement and are limited to an aggregate amount of $100 million through June 30, 2021, with such limit increasing to an aggregate amount of $250 million after June 30, 2021 if the Consolidated Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio is no greater than 3.75 to 1.00. The Company suspended dividends in April 2020 to preserve cash and provide flexibility in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since June 30, 2020, the Company has repurchased approximately $73 million of its common stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will declare dividends or repurchase stock in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.\nGeneral Risks\nFailure to attract and retain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce, or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect Howmet\u2019s operations and competitiveness.\nHowmet\u2019s global operations require highly skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience. Shortages in certain skills, in areas such as engineering, manufacturing and technology and other labor market inadequacies have created more competition for talent among us and other companies both within and outside of our industry. If the Company fails to attract, develop and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business, our operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the Company\u2019s growth and business strategy. The loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm Howmet\u2019s business, and any unplanned turnover, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions, could deplete the Company\u2019s institutional knowledge base, result in loss of technical or other expertise, delay or impede the execution of the Company\u2019s business plans and erode Howmet\u2019s competitiveness.\nHowmet may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliances.\nHowmet has made, and may continue to plan and execute, acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio. There is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized. Acquisitions present significant challenges and risks, including the effective integration of the business into the Company, unanticipated costs and\nliabilities, and the ability to realize anticipated benefits, such as growth in market share, revenue or margins, at the levels or in the timeframe expected. The Company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully. Additionally, adverse factors may prevent Howmet from realizing the benefits of its growth projects, including unfavorable global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, or unexpected delays in target timelines.\nWith respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures, curtailments and closures, Howmet may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations, including high exit costs or objections from customers, suppliers, unions, local or national governments, or other stakeholders. In addition, Howmet may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities or businesses, including, but not limited to, if a buyer fails to honor all commitments. Howmet\u2019s business operations are capital intensive, and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges, including employee separation costs, asset impairment charges and other measures.\nIn addition, Howmet has participated in, and may continue to participate in, strategic alliances, joint ventures and other similar arrangements from time to time. Strategic alliances and joint ventures inherently involve special risks. Even if Howmet holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements, its partners may have opposing economic or business interests, exercise veto rights to block Howmet actions, take action contrary to Howmet\u2019s policies or objectives, or, as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable to fulfill their obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that acquisitions, growth investments, divestitures, closures, strategic alliances, joint ventures or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to Howmet, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in costs, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risks, or other factors.\nAnti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of Howmet, including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of Howmet\u2019s shareholders.\nHowmet\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. For example, Howmet is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire Howmet. Additionally, the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other anti-takeover measures without stockholder approval. These provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Howmet\u2019s shareholders. These provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Howmet common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nArconic Corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction.\nIn connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Arconic Corporation and also entered into various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, an agreement related to the Davenport plant, an employee matters agreement, intellectual property license agreements, metal supply agreements and real estate and office leases. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the Company prior to the separation was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between us and Arconic Corporation following the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. We will rely on Arconic Corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Arconic Corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties and/or losses.\nIn connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify Arconic Corporation for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to Arconic Corporation, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Arconic Corporation indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Arconic Corporation is allocated responsibility, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with Arconic Corporation, Arconic Corporation has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Arconic Corporation for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Arconic Corporation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Arconic Corporation has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in\nfurtherance of the Company\u2019s operations. Further, the indemnity from Arconic Corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Arconic Corporation any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction could result in substantial tax liability.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution of Arconic that we receive an opinion of our outside counsel, satisfactory to our Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). This condition was satisfied prior to the Distribution of Arconic. However, the opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings by us and Arconic Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct by us and Arconic Corporation. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Arconic Corporation breach any of our representations or covenants contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding our receipt of the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the Distribution of Arconic and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that: (i) the IRS will not assert that the Distribution of Arconic and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii) a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, we, our stockholders and Arconic Corporation, could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIf the Distribution of Arconic fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the Arconic Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who received such Arconic Corporation shares in the Distribution of Arconic would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution of Arconic, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution of Arconic may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us as a result of certain post-distribution transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of ours or Arconic Corporation. Under the tax matters agreement entered into between us and Arconic Corporation in connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, Arconic Corporation may be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Arconic Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Arconic Corporation, or (iii) any of Arconic Corporation\u2019s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Arconic Corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Arconic Corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Arconic Corporation any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Arconic Inc. Separation Transaction, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from transactions (including the internal reorganization) in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction could result in substantial tax liability.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution of Alcoa that (i) the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction and the Distribution of Alcoa received by Howmet remain valid and be satisfactory to Howmet\u2019s Board of Directors and (ii) Howmet receive an opinion of its outside counsel, satisfactory to the Board of Directors, regarding the qualification of the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the Distribution of Alcoa. However, the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and\nundertakings of Howmet and Alcoa Corporation, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Howmet and Alcoa Corporation. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Howmet or Alcoa Corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding Howmet\u2019s receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution of Alcoa and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by Howmet of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that (i) the IRS will not assert that the Distribution of Alcoa and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (ii) a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge, Howmet, Alcoa Corporation and Howmet shareholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIf the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Howmet would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Alcoa Corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and Howmet shareholders who received Alcoa Corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, even if the Distribution of Alcoa, together with certain related transactions, otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, the Distribution of Alcoa may nevertheless be rendered taxable to Howmet and its shareholders as a result of certain post-Distribution of Alcoa transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of Howmet or Alcoa Corporation. The possibility of rendering the Distribution of Alcoa taxable as a result of such transactions may limit Howmet\u2019s ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of Howmet\u2019s business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement that Howmet entered into with Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Corporation may be required to indemnify Howmet against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Alcoa Corporation, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Alcoa Corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by Alcoa Corporation or (iii) any of Alcoa Corporation\u2019s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. However, the indemnity from Alcoa Corporation may be insufficient to protect Howmet against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities, and Alcoa Corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully. Moreover, even if Howmet ultimately succeeds in recovering from Alcoa Corporation any amounts for which Howmet is held liable, Howmet may be temporarily required to bear such losses. In addition, Howmet and Howmet\u2019s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Alcoa Inc. Separation Transaction, including tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. Each of these risks could negatively affect Howmet\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 24643, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "HWM"}
