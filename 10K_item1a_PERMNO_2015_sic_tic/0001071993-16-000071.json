{"cik": "1071993", "company": "CONTANGO OIL & GAS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating the Company. An investment in the Company is subject to risks inherent in our business. The trading price of the shares of the Company is affected by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions. The value of an investment in the Company may decrease, resulting in a loss.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have no ability to control the market price for natural gas and oil. Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and a continued substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and growth and could have a material adverse effect on the business, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nOur revenues, profitability and future growth depend significantly on natural gas and crude oil prices. Natural gas and crude oil prices declined severely during 2015 and have declined even further through 2016 to date. The markets for these commodities are volatile and prices received affect the amount of future cash flow available for capital expenditures and repayment of indebtedness and our ability to raise additional capital. Lower prices also affect the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce. Factors that can cause price fluctuations include:\n\u00b7\nOverall economic conditions, domestic and global.\n\u00b7\nThe domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and oil.\n\u00b7\nThe level of consumer product demand.\n\u00b7\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters.\n\u00b7\nThe price and availability of competitive fuels such as LNG, heating oil and coal.\n\u00b7\nPolitical conditions in the Middle East and other natural gas and oil producing regions.\n\u00b7\nThe level of LNG imports and any LNG exports.\n\u00b7\nDomestic and foreign governmental regulations.\n\u00b7\nSpecial taxes on production.\n\u00b7\nAccess to pipelines and gas processing plants.\n\u00b7\nThe loss of tax credits and deductions.\nA substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas and oil that may be economically produced by us. The Company may utilize financial derivative contracts, such as swaps, costless collars and puts on commodity prices, to reduce exposure to potential declines in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have derivative arrangements in place on any post-2015 production. During January 2016, we entered into financial derivative contracts with a member of our bank group resulting in 1,300,000 MMBtus of natural gas per month being hedged from February 2016 through July 2016, and from November 2016 through December 2016, and 250,000 MMBtus of natural gas per month being hedged from August 2016 through October 2016 through swaps that provide for a fixed price of $2.53 per MMBtu on the contract volumes.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in new or emerging plays; therefore, our drilling results in these areas are not certain.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging plays, such as in our South Texas and Wyoming resource plays, are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and with longer production history. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion strategies and techniques in these formations will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. Accordingly, our drilling results are subject to greater risks in these areas and could be unsuccessful. We may be unable to execute our expected drilling program in these areas because of disappointing drilling results, capital constraints, lease expirations, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntake-away capacity, availability of drilling rigs and other services or otherwise, and/or crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price declines. To the extent we are unable to execute our expected drilling program in these areas, our return on investment may not be as attractive as we anticipate and our common stock price may decrease. We could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future if our drilling results are unsuccessful.\nInitial production rates in shale plays tend to decline steeply in the first twelve months of production and are not necessarily indicative of sustained production rates.\nOur future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells. Initial production rates in shale plays tend to decline steeply in the first twelve months of production and are not necessarily indicative of sustained production rates. As a result, we generally must locate and develop or acquire new crude oil or natural gas reserves to offset declines in these initial production rates. If we are unable to do so, these declines in initial production rates may result in a decrease in our overall production and revenue over time.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of undeveloped acreage and/or a decline in our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit agreement. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7\nOur proved reserves.\n\u00b7\nThe level of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we are able to produce from existing wells.\n\u00b7\nThe prices at which crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels, to further develop and exploit our current properties, or to conduct exploratory activity. In order to fund our capital expenditures, we may need to seek additional financing. Our credit agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness without the consent of the lenders. Our lenders may withhold this consent in their sole discretion. In addition, if our borrowing base redetermination results in a lower borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit agreement, we may be unable to obtain financing otherwise currently available under our senior secured revolving credit agreement. As part of the regular redetermination schedule, the borrowing base on our revolving credit agreement was redetermined at $225 million effective May 8, 2015, and $190 million effective November 13, 2015 due primarily to lower commodity prices and the impact of the significant reduction in the Company\u2019s drilling program in 2015. Since the last regularly scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base, effective through May 1, 2016, commodity prices have continued to decline. The decline in prices will likely negatively impact the price decks utilized by banks in their calculation of the Company\u2019s borrowing base at May 1, 2016. It is not possible to forecast what that adjustment to the borrowing base might be at that time, and because of that uncertainty, the Company has currently limited its planned 2016 capital expenditure budget to a level that is below our projected internally generated cash flows, thereby allowing for the repayment of a portion of the outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d\nIn addition, our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness is unceratain and will be affected by our future performance and events or circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under such indebtedness and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under any of our other outstanding indebtedness.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. In particular, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ngenerally has diminished significantly. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms that are similar to existing debt, and reduced, or in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.\nWe rely on third-party operators to operate and maintain some of our wells, production platforms, pipelines and processing facilities and, as a result, we have limited control over the operations of such facilities. The interests of an operator may differ from our interests.\nWe depend upon the services of third-party operators to operate some production platforms, pipelines, gas processing facilities and the infrastructure required to produce and market our natural gas, condensate and oil. We have limited influence over the conduct of operations by third-party operators. As a result, we have little control over how frequently and how long our production is shut-in when production problems, weather and other production shut-ins occur. Poor performance on the part of, or errors or accidents attributable to, the operator of a project in which we participate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Also, the interest of an operator may differ from our interests.\nFailure of our working interest partners to fund their share of development costs could result in the delay or cancellation of future projects, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural gas and crude oil prices declined significantly during 2015 and have declined even further through 2016 to date. An extended or more severe downturn could have material adverse effects on the liquidity of our working interest partners. Our working interest partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources. If our partners are not able to fund their share of costs, it could result in the delay or cancellation of future projects, resulting in a reduction of our reserves and production, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risks of our customers and derivative counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or derivative counterparties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, which risks may increase during periods of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our significant customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In addition, our risk management activities are subject to the risks that a counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument, the terms of the derivative instruments are imperfect, and our risk management policies and procedures are not properly followed. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or our derivative counterparties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRepeated offshore production shut-ins can possibly damage our well bores.\nOur offshore well bores are required to be shut-in from time to time due to a variety of issues, including a combination of weather, mechanical problems, sand production, bottom sediment, water and paraffin associated with our condensate production, as well as downstream third-party facility and pipeline shut-ins. In addition, shut-ins are necessary from time to time to upgrade and improve the production handling capacity at related downstream platform, gas processing and pipeline infrastructure. In addition to negatively impacting our near term revenues and cash flow, repeated production shut-ins may damage our well bores if repeated excessively or not executed properly. The loss of a well bore due to damage could require us to drill additional wells.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNatural gas and oil reserves are depleting assets and the failure to replace our reserves would adversely affect our production and cash flows.\nOur future natural gas and oil production depends on our success in finding or acquiring new reserves. If we fail to replace reserves, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely impacted. Production from natural gas and oil properties decline as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Further, the majority of our reserves are proved developed producing. Accordingly, we do not have significant opportunities to increase our production from our existing proved reserves. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of natural gas and oil reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. If we are not successful, our future production and revenues will be adversely affected.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including many factors that are beyond our control. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities of reserves shown in this report.\nIn order to prepare these estimates, our independent third-party petroleum engineers must project production rates and timing of development expenditures as well as analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions relating to matters such as natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and pre-tax net present value of reserves shown in a reserve report. In addition, estimates of our proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and may prove to be incorrect over time. As a result, our estimates may require substantial upward or downward revisions if subsequent drilling, testing and production reveal different results. Furthermore, some of the producing wells included in our reserve report have produced for a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, some of our reserve estimates are not based on a multi-year production decline curve and are calculated using a reservoir simulation model together with volumetric analysis. Any downward adjustment could indicate lower future production and thus adversely affect our financial condition, future prospects and market value.\nApproximately 16% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 were proved undeveloped reserves. The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures that we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nRecovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. Although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards, we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is the current market value of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate, held flat for the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. The present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 was based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period January through December 2015. For our condensate and natural gas liquids, the average West Texas Intermediate (Cushing) posted price was $50.28 per barrel for offshore volumes and the average West Texas Intermediate (Plains) posted price was $46.79 per barrel for onshore volumes. For our natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was $2.587 per MMBtu for offshore volumes and the average Henry Hub spot price was $2.587 per MMBtu for onshore volumes. Assuming strip pricing as of March 1, 2016 through 2020 and keeping pricing flat thereafter, instead of 2015 SEC pricing, while leaving all other parameters unchanged, the Company\u2019s proved reserves would have been 185.4 Bcfe and the PV-10 value of proved reserves would have been $226.3 million. Any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of crude oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock. A reconciliation of our Standardized Measure to PV-10 is provided under \"Item 2. Properties - PV-10\".\nActual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by oil and gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. The timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor.\nOur use of 2D and 3D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are uncertain. For example, we have over 4,000 square miles of 3D data in the South Texas and Gulf Coast regions. However, even when used and properly interpreted, 3D seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators. They do not allow the interpreter to know if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically. Other geologists and petroleum professionals, when studying the same seismic data, may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals.\nIn addition, the use of 3D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses due to such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nunusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations;\n\u00b7\npressures;\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nexplosions and blowouts;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\npipe or cement failures;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u00b7\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u00b7\nunexpected operational events;\n\u00b7\nshortages of skilled personnel;\n\u00b7\nshortages or delivery delays of equipment and services or of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters; and\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, clean-up responsibilities, loss of wells, repairs to resume operations; and regulatory fines or penalties.\nInsurance against all operational risks is not available to us. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. We carry limited environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe potential lack of availability of, or high cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and crude oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget.\nWhen the prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids increase, or the demand for equipment and services is greater than the supply in certain areas, we typically encounter an increase in the cost of securing drilling rigs, equipment and supplies. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur hedging activities could result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as interest rates, we have, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our crude oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids production and our debt that could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses. We typically utilize financial instruments to hedge commodity price exposure to declining prices on our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. We typically use a combination of puts, swaps and costless collars. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivatives in place. In January 2016, we entered into financial derivative contracts with a member of our bank group resulting in 1,300,000 MMBtus of natural gas per month being hedged from February 2016 through July 2016, and from November 2016 through December 2016, and 250,000 MMBtus of natural gas per month being hedged from August 2016 through October 2016 through swaps that provide for a fixed price of $2.53 per MMBtu on the contract volumes.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into hedging transactions for such period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nunderlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margin. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows. The proposed margin rules are not yet final, and therefore the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts or increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nIf prices remain at current levels or decline further, we will likely incur substantial further impairment of proved properties.\nIf management\u2019s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and/or natural gas prices decline further in 2016 as they have done in 2014 and 2015, we will likely be required to record further non-cash impairment write-downs in the future, which would result in a negative impact to our financial results. Furthermore, any sustained decline in oil and/or natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments. We review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review. To determine if a depletable unit is impaired, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncompare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management\u2019s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property. Future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers\u2019 estimates of proved reserves. In addition, other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions. For each property determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis.\nFair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows. Any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization to reduce our recorded cost basis in the asset. Each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment, including the determination of the depletable units\u2019 estimated reserves, future cash flows and fair value.\nManagement\u2019s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future. Any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded, impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset. Any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property, as well as the property\u2019s fair value. Additionally, as management\u2019s views related to future prices change, the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates. Changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment.\nProduction activities in the Gulf of Mexico increase our susceptibility to pollution and natural resource damage.\nA blowout, rupture or spill of any magnitude would present serious operational and financial challenges. All of the Company\u2019s operations in the Gulf of Mexico shelf are in water depths of less than 300 feet and less than 50 miles from the coast. Such proximity to the shore-line increases the probability of a biological impact or damaging the fragile eco-system in the event of released condensate.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives restricting emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nBased on findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which includes certain of our operations.\nWhile, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax. For example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules, expected to be finalized in 2016, that would establish new controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent in 2025. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how new methane restrictions would impact our business or how or when the United State might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international agreement agreed to in Paris, any new legal requirements that impose more stringent requirements on the emission of GHGs from our operations could result in increased compliance costs or additional\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\noperating restrictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of the FERC, the CFTC, or the FTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. We believe that the gas gathering facilities we own meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline system\u2019s status as a non-jurisdictional gatherer. Under the 2005 Act and implementing regulations, the FERC prohibits market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas. The CFTC has similar authority under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations it has promulgated thereunder with respect to certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas. The FTC also prohibits manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market with respect to sales of commodities, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. These agencies have substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation. The FERC has also imposed requirements related to reporting of natural gas sales volumes that may impact the formation of prices indices. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these and other matters may be considered or adopted from time to time. Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations administered by these agencies could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, as described in Part I, Item 1: \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters.\u201d\nThe natural gas and oil business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some liabilities or losses that we may incur.\nThe natural gas and oil business involves a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u00b7\nBlowouts, fires and explosions.\n\u00b7\nSurface cratering.\n\u00b7\nUncontrollable flows of underground natural gas, oil or formation water.\n\u00b7\nNatural disasters.\n\u00b7\nPipe and cement failures.\n\u00b7\nCasing collapses.\n\u00b7\nStuck drilling and service tools.\n\u00b7\nReservoir compaction.\n\u00b7\nAbnormal pressure formations.\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures or unauthorized discharges of brine, toxic gases or well fluids.\n\u00b7\nCapacity constraints, equipment malfunctions and other problems at third-party operated platforms, pipelines and gas processing plants over which we have no control.\n\u00b7\nRepeated shut-ins of our well bores could significantly damage our well bores.\n\u00b7\nRequired workovers of existing wells that may not be successful.\nIf any of the above events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\nInjury or loss of life.\n\u00b7\nReservoir damage.\n\u00b7\nSevere damage to and destruction of property or equipment.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nPollution and other environmental and natural resources damage.\n\u00b7\nRestoration, decommissioning or clean-up responsibilities.\n\u00b7\nRegulatory investigations and penalties.\n\u00b7\nSuspension of our operations or repairs necessary to resume operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing and collisions. In addition, offshore operations, and in some instances operations along the Gulf Coast, are subject to damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of properties.\nIf we were to experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities, any one of which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. In accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, and particular types of coverage may not be available. An event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur ability to market our natural gas and oil may be impaired by capacity constraints and equipment malfunctions on the platforms, gathering systems, pipelines and gas plants that transport and process our natural gas and oil.\nAll of our natural gas and oil is transported through gathering systems, pipelines and processing plants. Transportation capacity on gathering system pipelines and platforms is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to these facilities or due to capacity being utilized by other natural gas or oil shippers that may have priority transportation agreements. If the gathering systems, processing plants, platforms or our transportation capacity is materially restricted or is unavailable in the future, our ability to market our natural gas or oil could be impaired and cash flow from the affected properties could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, repeated shut-ins of our wells could result in damage to our well bores that would impair our ability to produce from these wells and could result in additional wells being required to produce our reserves.\nIf our access to sales markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation arrangements may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possible loss of a lease due to lack of production.\nWe may not have title to our leased interests and if any lease is later rendered invalid, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site.\nOur practice in acquiring exploration leases or undivided interests in natural gas and oil leases is to not incur the expense of retaining title lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest prior to executing the lease. Instead, we rely upon the judgment of consultants and others to perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental, county or parish clerk\u2019s office before leasing a specific mineral interest. This practice is widely followed in the industry. Prior to the drilling of an exploration well\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe operator of the well will typically obtain a preliminary title review of the drillsite lease and/or spacing unit within which the proposed well is to be drilled to identify any obvious deficiencies in title to the well and, if there are deficiencies, to identify measures necessary to cure those defects to the extent reasonably possible. However, such deficiencies may not have been cured by the operator of such wells. It does happen, from time to time, that the examination made by title lawyers reveals that the lease or leases are invalid, having been purchased in error from a person who is not the rightful owner of the mineral interest desired. In these circumstances, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site or may incur costs to remedy a defect. It may also happen, from time to time, that the operator may elect to proceed with a well despite defects to the title identified in the preliminary title opinion.\nCompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than many of our competitors.\nWe compete with a broad range of natural gas and oil companies in our exploration and property acquisition activities. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and oil properties. Further, they may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil and to acquire additional properties in the future depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, many of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time than we have and have substantially larger staffs. We may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or in such a highly competitive environment.\nProposed U.S. federal budgets and pending legislation contain certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe federal administration has released repeated budget proposals over the past few years which include numerous proposed tax changes. The proposed budgets and legislation would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by oil and gas companies in the United States and impose new taxes. Among others, the provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for oil and gas properties; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers; and implementation of a fee on non-producing leases located on federal lands. Should some or all of these provisions become law, taxes on the E&P industry would increase, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Although these proposals initially were made in 2009, none have become law. It is still, however, the federal administration\u2019s stated intention to enact legislation to repeal tax incentives and deductions and impose new taxes on oil and gas companies.\nWe are subject to stringent laws and regulations, including environmental requirements that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of our facilities, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations:\n\u00b7\nRequire that we obtain permits before commencing drilling or other regulated activities.\n\u00b7\nRestrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities.\n\u00b7\nLimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas, such as wetlands or wilderness areas.\n\u00b7\nRequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells.\n\u00b7\nImpose substantial penalties for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury and clean-up costs and other environmental natural resource and property damages. We maintain insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages; however, it is possible that coverage might not be sufficient in a catastrophic event. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability, or we may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages. The trend in environmental laws and regulations is to place more stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards. The EPA is required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017. With EPA lowering the ground-level ozone standard, states may be required to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations and require the installation of , resulting in a need to install new emissions controls, longer permitting timelines and significant increases in our capital or operating expenditures. In another example, the EPA issued a final rule in May 2015 that attempts to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States but this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as that appellate court and numerous district courts ponder lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we can provided no assurance that our future compliance with existing laws and regulations, these recently adopted rulemakings, or any new or amended legal requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nWe may incur significant environmental costs liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. We currently own, operate or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. An accidental release such, for example, while drilling a well, could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property and natural resource damages as well as monetary fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for these costs and liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of our conduct. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be required to remove remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging or other decommissioning activities to prevent future contamination. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, or other similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional CAA regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. Moreover, from time to time, Congress has considered, but not enacted, legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nhydraulic fracturing process. In addition, certain states, including Texas and Wyoming, where we conduct operations, have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach of the State of New York in 2015. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we currently or in the future plan to operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Also, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in June 2015, which report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that EPA\u2019s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nWe may be subject to increased supplemental bonding under the BOEM financial assurance requirements.\nEnergy companies conducting oil and natural gas lease operations offshore on the OCS are required by the BOEM, among other obligations, to conduct decommissioning within specified times following cessation of offshore producing activities, which decommissioning includes the plugging of wells, removal of platforms and other facilities, and the clearing of obstacles from the lease site sea floor. To cover a lease operator\u2019s decommissioning obligations, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulations or otherwise post bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such future obligations will be satisfied. As an operator, we are required to post surety bonds of $200,000 per lease for exploration and $500,000 per lease for developmental activities as part of our general bonding requirements, as well as the posting of additional supplemental bonds to cover, among other things, our decommissioning obligations. We typically post surety bonds with the BOEM to satisfy our general and supplemental bonding requirements.\nIn recent years, the BOEM has sought to bolster its financial assurance requirements imposed on offshore operators on the OCS. For example, in August 2014, the BOEM published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPR\u201d), pursuant to which it seeks to bolster its current bonding requirements established under its rules. While the BOEM is yet to propose rules pursuant to the ANPR, in September 2015, it issued draft guidance (\u201cDraft Guidance\u201d) describing revised supplemental bonding procedures the agency plans to use to impose financial assurance obligations for decommissioning activities on the OCS. Once the Draft Guidance is finalized, the BOEM will issue these supplemental bonding changes in a revised notice to lessees (\u201cNTL\u201d) that will replace an existing 2008 NTL that covers supplemental bonding requirements and related exemptions regarding such external financial assurances. Among other things, the Draft Guidance proposes to eliminate a \u201cwaiver\u201d exemption currently allowed by the BOEM, whereby operators on the OCS meeting certain relatively large net worth and other criteria have the option of being exempted from posting supplemental bonds or other acceptable financial assurances for such operator\u2019s decommissioning obligations. Under the existing 2008 NTL, qualifying operators may self-insure to meet supplemental bonding requirements, but only to the extent the estimated cumulative decommissioning liability is no more than 50% of the operator\u2019s net worth. Under the Draft Guidance, this waiver option would be eliminated and qualifying operators would only be able to self-insure for an amount that is no more than 10% of their tangible net worth. In addition, the Draft Guidance would implement a phase-in period for establishing compliance with supplemental bonding obligations, whereby operators may seek payment of estimated costs of decommissioning obligations owed under a \u201ctailored plan\u201d that is approved by the BOEM and would require payment of the supplemental bonding amount in three approximately equal installments during a one year period from the date of BOEM approval of the tailored plan. It is expected that the revised NTL will be issued by the BOEM by summer 2016. While we have satisfied past secondary bonding obligations imposed by the BOEM, the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrevised NTL, once it is issued and implemented by the BOEM, could result in our having to post additional supplemental bonds to the extent that we no longer have the opportunity to obtain waivers from supplemental bonding. The cost of posting additional supplemental bonds or other financial assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases. Obtaining such bonds may require us to provide other financial assurances to the surety company, such as bank letters of credit, which can limit available liquidity.\nMoreover, notwithstanding any issuance of a revised NTL, the effect of the significant reduction in oil and natural gas pricing since mid-2014 on operators of, and other owners of interests in, offshore federal leases has impacted the BOEM\u2019s financial assurance determinations with respect to such operators and owners. In those cases where the BOEM determines that a company can no longer demonstrate the requisite financial strength and reliability to maintain a waiver from supplemental bonding, the BOEM may direct such operator to relinquish such waiver and instead post increased supplemental bonding amounts. In the event any such increases in supplemental bonding were required of us, such increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. A failure by an operator to post required supplemental bonding or other financial assurances required by the BOEM could result in the BOEM assessing monetary penalties or requiring any on an operator\u2019s federal lease to be suspended or cancelled or otherwise subject an operator to monetary penalties. Any one or more such actions imposed on us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe BSEE has implemented much more stringent controls and reporting requirements that if not followed, could result in significant monetary penalties or a shut-in of all or a portion of our Gulf of Mexico operations.\nThe BSEE is the federal agency responsible for overseeing the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the OCS. They are responsible for leading the most aggressive and comprehensive reforms to offshore oil and gas regulation and oversight in U.S. history. Their reforms have tightened requirements for everything from well design and workplace safety to corporate accountability.\nAdditionally, the OCS Lands Act authorizes and requires the BSEE to provide for both an annual scheduled inspection and a periodic unscheduled (unannounced) inspection of all oil and gas operations on the OCS. In addition to examining all safety equipment designed to prevent blowouts, fires, spills, or other major accidents, the inspections focus on pollution, drilling operations, completions, workovers, production, and pipeline safety. Upon detecting a violation, the inspector issues an Incident of Noncompliance (\"INC\") to the operator and uses one of two main enforcement actions (warning or shut-in), depending on the severity of the violation. If the violation is not severe or threatening, a warning INC is issued. The warning INC must be corrected within a reasonable amount of time specified on the INC. The shut-in INC may be for a single component (a portion of the facility) or the entire facility. The violation must be corrected before the operator is allowed to resume the activity in question.\nIn addition to the enforcement actions specified above, the BSEE can assess a civil penalty of up to $40,000 per violation per day if: (i) the operator fails to correct the violation in the reasonable amount of time specified on the INC; or (ii) the violation resulted in a threat of serious harm or damage to human life or the environment. Operators with excessive INCs may be required to cease operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAdditional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and other related restrictions arising after the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon explosive incident and resulting oil spill in the United States Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the BOEM and the BSEE have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory restrictions, in addition to any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM and/or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in April 2015, the BSEE issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, expected to be finalized in 2016, that focuses on well blowout preventer systems and well control with respect to operations on the OCS. The proposed rule requires, among other things, incorporation of the latest industry standards\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nestablishing minimum baseline standards for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers, as well as more controls over the maintenance and repair of blowout preventers. These recent or any new rules, regulations or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities, any one or more of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Also, if material spill events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations or legal initiatives on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team, our exploration partners, third-party consultants and engineers, and other key personnel and any failure to retain the services of such parties could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy and handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy is highly dependent on our management team, as well as certain key geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals engaged by us. The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified technical professionals could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to manage our growth, if any, will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.\nAcquisition prospects are difficult to assess and may pose additional risks to our operations.\nWe expect to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities on terms our management considers favorable. The successful acquisition of natural gas and oil properties requires an assessment of:\n\u00b7\nRecoverable reserves.\n\u00b7\nExploration potential.\n\u00b7\nFuture natural gas and oil prices.\n\u00b7\nOperating costs.\n\u00b7\nPotential environmental and other liabilities and other factors.\n\u00b7\nPermitting and other authorizations, including environmental permits and authorizations, required for our operations.\nIn connection with such an assessment, we would expect to perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Nonetheless, the resulting conclusions are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain and such an assessment may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it necessarily permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Future acquisitions could pose additional risks to our operations and financial results, including:\n\u00b7\nProblems integrating the purchased operations, personnel or technologies.\n\u00b7\nUnanticipated costs.\n\u00b7\nDiversion of resources and management attention from our exploration business.\n\u00b7\nEntry into regions or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\n\u00b7\nPotential loss of key employees of the acquired organization.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the properties and assets we acquire with our existing operations.\nIntegration of the properties and assets we acquire may be a complex, time consuming and costly process. Failure to timely and successfully integrate these assets and properties with our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. The difficulties of integrating these assets and properties present numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nAcquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows.\n\u00b7\nWe may need to (i) recruit additional personnel and we cannot be certain that any of our recruiting efforts will succeed and (ii) expand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those associated with the acquired properties, and failure to do so may lead to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or distract our management.\n\u00b7\nOur management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nWe are also exposed to risks that are commonly associated with acquisitions of this type, such as unanticipated liabilities and costs, some of which may be material. As a result, the anticipated benefits of acquiring assets and properties may not be fully realized, if at all.\nWhen we acquire properties, in most cases, we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities.\nWe generally acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties, and in these situations we cannot assure you that we will identify all areas of existing or potential exposure. In those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre-closing liabilities, we cannot assure you that the seller will be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. In addition, the competition to acquire producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties is intense and many of our larger competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties that have economically recoverable reserves for acceptable prices.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nconditions that impact demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, domestically and globally;\n\u00b7\nfuture announcements concerning our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nactions of competitors;\n\u00b7\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government and environmental regulation;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, domestically and globally;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\nsales of common stock by us, our significant stockholders or members of our management team; and\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks and acts of war.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNatural gas and crude oil prices declined severely during 2015 and have declined even further through 2016 to date. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This decline in commodity prices and stock market volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nWe have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.\nOur board of directors presently intends to retain all of our earnings for the expansion of our business; therefore, we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Also, the provisions of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and second lien credit agreement restrict the payment of dividends. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 116,461 stock options outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which were fully vested.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u00b7\npermit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, if any, and any qualification, limitations or restrictions of the shares of such series;\n\u00b7\nrequire special meetings of the stockholders to be called by the Chairman of the board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or by resolution of a majority of the board of directors;\n\u00b7\nrequire business at special meetings to be limited to the stated purpose or purposes of that meeting;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nrequire that stockholder action be taken at a meeting rather than by written consent, unless approved by our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nrequire that stockholders follow certain procedures, including advance notice procedures, to bring certain matters before an annual meeting or to nominate a director for election; and\n\u00b7\npermit directors to fill vacancies in our board of directors.\nWe are subject to the Delaware business combination law.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nSection 203 defines a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d as a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholders. Section 203 defines an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d as a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or, in some cases, within three years prior, did own, 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between us and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless:\n\u00b7\nour board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholders becoming an interested stockholder prior to the date the person attained the status;\n\u00b7\nupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and issued employee stock plans, under which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u00b7\nthe business combination is approved by our board of directors on or subsequent to the date the person became an interested stockholder and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThis provision has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock. With approval of our stockholders, we could amend our certificate of incorporation in the future to elect not to be governed by the anti-takeover law.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.", "PERMNO": 88871, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MCF"}
