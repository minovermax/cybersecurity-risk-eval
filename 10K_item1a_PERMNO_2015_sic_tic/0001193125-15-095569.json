{"cik": "730272", "company": "REPLIGEN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the risk factors described below before making an investment decision.\nIf any of the events described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that affect Repligen.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe face competition from numerous competitors, most of whom have far greater resources than we have, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve significant market penetration.\nThe bioprocessing market is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants.\nMany of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly more market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more aggressively on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Many of these competitors have:\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\nlarger and more established distribution networks;\n\u2022\nadditional lines of products and the ability to bundle products to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing, obtaining regulatory approval and entering into collaboration or other strategic partnership arrangements; and\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation.\nOur current competitors or other companies may at any time develop additional products that compete with our products. If an existing or future competitor develops products that compete with or are superior to our products, our revenue may decline. In addition, some of our competitors may compete by lowering the price of their products. If prices were to fall, we may not be able to improve our gross margins or sales growth sufficiently to maintain and grow our profitability.\nWe depend on, and expect to continue to depend on, a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenues.\nAs a result, the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and harm our results of operations. If a large customer purchases fewer of our products, defers orders or fails to place additional orders with us, our revenue could decline, and our operating results may not meet market expectations. In addition, if those customers order our products, but fail to pay on time or at all, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, if any of our current or future products compete with those of any of our largest customers, these customers may place fewer orders with us or cease placing orders with us, which would could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nAs we evolve from a company dependent on others to commercialize our products to a company selling directly to end users, we may encounter difficulties in expanding our product portfolio and our commercial efforts.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s decision to focus our efforts on the growth of our core bioprocessing business, we are increasingly seeking to develop and commercialize our own portfolio of products. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully develop and acquire additional bioprocessing products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully acquire or develop additional bioprocessing products, and the Company\u2019s financial performance will likely suffer if we are unable to do so.\nIf intangible assets that we recorded in connection with our acquisitions become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for the Novozymes Acquisition, we recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, including developed technology and customer relationships relating to the growth factor products. In addition, in connection with the accounting for the Refine acquisition, we recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, including developed technology and customer relationships relating to the ATF system. Under U.S. GAAP, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of intangible assets has been impaired. Intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nOur exposure to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business has and may continue to increase.\nOur operations and sales outside of the United States have increased as a result of the Novozymes Acquisition and the Refine Acquisition and the continued expansion of our commercial organization. Risks related to these increased foreign operations include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly as a result of ongoing economic instability within the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to complex and restrictive employment and labor laws and regulations, as well as union and works council restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws or rulings in the United States or other foreign jurisdictions that may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to burdensome foreign laws and regulations, including regulations that may place an increased tax burden on our operations;\n\u2022\nbeing subject to longer payment cycles from customers and experiencing greater difficulties in timely accounts receivable collections; and\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations.\nOur business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other. We cannot assure you that these and other related factors will not materially adversely affect our international operations or business as a whole.\nWe may be unable to manage efficiently having become a larger and more geographically diverse organization.\nThe Novozymes Acquisition, the Refine Acquisition, the continued expansion of our commercial sales operations, and our organic growth have increased the scope and complexity of our business. We will face\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing a more complex business with an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs. Our inability to manage successfully the geographically more diverse (including from a cultural perspective) and substantially larger combined organization could materially adversely affect our operating results and, as a result, the market price of our common stock.\nThe environmental risks of our business have increased dramatically.\nOur manufacturing business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and is therefore subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations. In addition to these hazardous materials and chemicals, our facility in Sweden also uses Staphylococcus aureus and toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus in some of its manufacturing processes. Staphylococcus aureus and the toxins it produces, particularly enterotoxins, can cause severe illness in humans. The costs of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations are significant and have increased since we completed the acquisition of the Novozymes Biopharma Business. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, of current or future environmental, safety laws or regulations and the cost of compliance with any resulting order or fine could adversely affect our operations.\nOur acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.\nIn addition to the Novozymes Acquisition and the Refine Acquisition, and as a part of our growth strategy, we may make selected acquisitions of complementary products and/or businesses. Any acquisition involves numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel;\n\u2022\nproblems maintaining uniform procedures, controls and policies with respect to our financial accounting systems;\n\u2022\nlack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\nunderperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;\n\u2022\nnegative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nclaims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;\n\u2022\nthe assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions would dilute the ownership of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions may not be an option of if the price of our common stock is low or volatile which could preclude us from completing any such acquisitions;\n\u2022\nany collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangement may require us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;\n\u2022\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nassumption of, or exposure to, historical liabilities of the acquired business, including unknown contingent or similar liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify.\nIn addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies. There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we may make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure to successfully address the foregoing risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.\nIn connection with the Refine Acquisition, we entered into a transition services agreement whereby the sellers agreed to provide transitional services that were reasonably required to operate the Refine Business for a period of up to six (6) months. After this transitional period, we began integrating such operation into our current business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Furthermore, we expect a portion of our future revenue growth to come from existing and new ATF System products and technologies. The commercial success will depend on, among other factors, our successful integration of the Refine Business, and the acceptance of the ATF System products and technologies by the life science and biopharmaceutical industries. As a result, there can be no assurance that these products and technologies, even if successfully developed and introduced, will be accepted by customers. If customers do not adopt our ATF products and technologies, our results of operations may suffer and, as a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nThe ATF System business relies on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, one supplier, and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the ATF System business and our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nThere are only a limited number of suppliers of materials related to the ATF System products, one of which is the sole supplier of materials used for consumable ATF System products. An interruption in operations of the business related to these products could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these materials, or if we cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption could significantly affect the business related to these products and our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe believe that only a small number of suppliers are currently qualified to supply materials for the ATF system. The use of materials furnished by these replacement suppliers would require us to alter our operations related to the ATF system. Transitioning to a new supplier would be time consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations, could affect the performance specifications of the ATF system or could require that we revalidate the materials. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure alternative materials, and bring such materials on line and revalidate them without experiencing interruptions in our workflow. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring or revalidating the materials required for ATF System products, our business related to these products and our financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nOur royalty agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb on sales of Orencia expired on December 31, 2013.\nOur royalty agreement with Bristol provided for us to receive payments from Bristol based on their net sales of their Orencia\u00ae product in the United States through December 31, 2013. As a result, we no longer receive royalty payments under this agreement as of December 31, 2013. If we are unable to replace these royalty payments with an alternative source of revenue and related income, our operating results will decline and, as a result, we may experience a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur license agreement with Pfizer will expire on April 26, 2015.\nOur licensing agreement with Pfizer provided for us to potentially receive payments from Pfizer based on milestones related to clinical development and initial commercial sales in specific geographies, as well as royalty payments from Pfizer based on its future sales of RG3039 or any SMA compounds developed under the license agreement. On January 26, 2015, Pfizer issued to us a notice of its termination of the License Agreement for convenience, effective as of April 26, 2015. As a result, we will no longer receive milestone payments under this agreement.\nWe have limited sales and marketing capabilities.\nWe have a small sales force and, historically, we have generated most of our revenues through sales of bioprocessing products to a limited number of life sciences companies, such as GE Healthcare, EMD Millipore, Sigma-Aldrich, Life Technologies and through other individual distributors. However, due in part to the Refine Acquisition, an increasing amount of our revenue is attributable to our commercialization of bioprocessing products that we sell directly to end-users such as biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing organizations. This will require us to invest additional resources in our sales and marketing capabilities. We may not be able to attract and retain additional sales and marketing professionals, and the cost of building the sales and marketing function may not generate our anticipated revenue growth. In addition, our sales and marketing efforts may be unsuccessful. Our failure to manage these risks may have a negative impact on our financial condition, or results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property, we may not be able to succeed commercially.\nWe endeavor to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our products and processes when available in order to protect them from unauthorized use and to produce a financial return consistent with the significant time and expense required to bring our products to market. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain patent protection for our products and manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\npreserve our trade secrets;\n\u2022\noperate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties; and\n\u2022\nsecure any necessary licenses from others on acceptable terms.\nWe cannot be sure that any patent applications relating to our products that we will file in the future or that any currently pending applications will issue on a timely basis, if ever. Since patent applications in the United States filed prior to November 2000 are maintained in secrecy until patents issue and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Even if patents are issued, the degree of protection afforded by such patents will depend upon the:\n\u2022\nscope of the patent claims;\n\u2022\nvalidity and enforceability of the claims obtained in such patents; and\n\u2022\nour willingness and financial ability to enforce and/or defend them.\nThe patent position of life sciences companies is often highly uncertain and usually involves complex legal and scientific questions. Patents which may be granted to us in certain foreign countries may be subject to opposition proceedings brought by third parties or result in suits by us, which may be costly and result in adverse consequences for us.\nIn some cases, litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to assert claims of infringement, to enforce patents issued to us or our licensors, to protect trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights we own or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the United States that claim technology also claimed by us, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which would result in substantial costs to us.\nSince some of our U.S. patents covering recombinant Protein A have expired, we may face increased competition, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects.\nOther companies could begin manufacturing and selling native or some of the commercial forms of recombinant Protein A in the U.S. and may directly compete with us on certain Protein A products. This may induce us to sell Protein A at lower prices and may erode our market share, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects.\nOur freedom to develop our products may be challenged by others, and we may have to engage in litigation to determine the scope and validity of competitors\u2019 patents and proprietary rights, which, if we do not prevail, could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding the complex patent and other intellectual property rights in the life sciences industry. We have been a party to, and in the future may become a party to, patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights.\nOther types of situations in which we may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings include:\n\u2022\nWe may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to invalidate the patents held by such third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or services do not infringe such third parties\u2019 patents.\n\u2022\nWe may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to enforce our patents against infringement.\n\u2022\nIf our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us, we may participate in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention.\n\u2022\nIf third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, we will need to defend against such claims.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. If a patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding is resolved in a way that is unfavorable to us, we or our collaborative or strategic partners may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products and services without a license from the other party and be held liable for significant damages. The failure to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time, attention and resources.\nWe may become involved in litigation or other proceedings with collaborative partners, which may be time consuming, costly and could result in delays in our development and commercialization efforts.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s decision to focus its efforts on the growth of its core bioprocessing business, we will seek development and commercialization partnerships for our remaining portfolio of clinical stage assets. Any disputes with such partners, such as BioMarin, that lead to litigation or similar proceedings may result in us incurring legal expenses, as well as facing potential legal liability. Such disputes, litigation or other proceedings are also time consuming and may cause delays in our development and commercialization efforts. If we fail to resolve these disputes quickly and with terms that are no less favorable to us than the current terms of the arrangements, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and future prospects may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to continue to hire and retain skilled personnel, then we will have trouble developing and marketing our products.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued service of our management and scientific staff and our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled technical, scientific, management and marketing personnel. We also face significant competition in the hiring and retention of such personnel from other companies, research and academic institutions, government and other organizations who have superior funding and resources. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain skilled personnel could materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business.\nThe market may not be receptive to our new bioprocessing products upon their introduction.\nWe expect a portion of our future revenue growth to come from introducing new bioprocessing products, such as a larger size version of our OPUS disposable chromatography products, the ATF System we acquired from Refine, and new growth factors. The commercial success of these products, as well as the products acquired in the Novozymes Acquisition and the Refine Acquisition, will depend upon their acceptance by the life science and biopharmaceutical industries. Many of the bioprocessing products that we are developing are based upon new technologies or approaches. As a result, there can be no assurance that these new products, even if successfully developed and introduced, will be accepted by customers. If customers do not adopt our new products and technologies, our results of operations may suffer and, as a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf our new products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position could suffer.\nThere can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or market acceptance of new products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products. Failure of our new products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, we could experience lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality bioprocessing products. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our products and technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected. Although our products are tested prior to shipment, defects or errors could nonetheless occur in our products. Furthermore, the Protein A that we manufacture is subsequently incorporated into products that are sold by other life sciences companies and we have no control over the manufacture and production of those products.\nIn the future, if our products experience, or are perceived to experience, a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. Such defects or errors could also narrow the scope of the use of our products, which could hinder our success in the market. Even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any lingering concerns in our target market regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our products could continue to result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, increased service and warranty costs and claims against us.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner, our operating results will be harmed, our ability to generate revenue could be diminished and our gross margin may be negatively impacted.\nOur revenues and other operating results will depend in large part on our ability to manufacture and assemble our products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner. Any interruptions we experience in the manufacturing or shipping of our products could delay our ability to recognize revenues in a particular quarter. Manufacturing problems can and do arise, and as demand for our products increases, any such problems could have an increasingly significant impact on our operating results. While we have not generally experienced problems with, or delays in, our production capabilities that resulted in delays in our ability to ship finished products, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such problems in the future. We may not be able to quickly ship products and recognize anticipated revenues for a given period if we experience significant delays in the manufacturing process. In addition, we must maintain sufficient production capacity in order to meet anticipated customer demand, which carries fixed costs that we may not be able to offset if orders slow, which would adversely affect our operating margins. If we are unable to manufacture our products consistently, in sufficient quantities, and on a timely basis, our bioprocessing revenue, gross margins and our other operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, our customers\u2019 future purchases are difficult to predict and any failure to meet financial expectations may result in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors such as the impact of seasonal spending patterns, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, the inability of some of our customers to consummate anticipated purchases of our products due to changes in end-user demand, and other unpredictable factors that may affect ordering patterns. Because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indicator of our future performance. Additionally, if revenue declines in a quarter, whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue, adverse economic conditions or otherwise, our results of operations will be harmed because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, a large portion of our manufacturing costs, our research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are not significantly affected by variations in revenue. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet investor expectations, the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur future revenues pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with BioMarin regarding the HDACi program depends significantly on BioMarin\u2019s development and commercialization activities, over which we have no control. If BioMarin is unable or determines not to further develop or commercialize the HDACi program, or experiences significant delays in doing so, we may see a delay in receiving any potential milestone or royalty payments or fail to receive any additional financial benefits from the program.\nWe entered into an asset purchase agreement with BioMarin on January 21, 2014, related to the histone deacetylase inhibitor (\u201cHDACi\u201d) portfolio, which includes the Friedreich\u2019s ataxia program. We are dependent on BioMarin for the future success of this development program. We have no control over the conduct and timing of\ndevelopment efforts with respect to the HDACi program. BioMarin\u2019s failure to devote sufficient financial and other resources to the development plan may result in the delayed or unsuccessful development of the program, which could lead to the non-payment or delay in payment of milestones under the asset purchase agreement and may preclude or delay commercialization of any product under the HDACi program and any royalties we could receive on future commercial sales. Our future financial results may be harmed if BioMarin does not commercialize the HDACi program successfully or on a timely basis prior to the achievement of any milestones or the payment of any royalties to us.\nHealth care reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nThe efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including us. Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. The U.S. Congress passed the America Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and is considering a number of proposals that are intended to reduce or limit the growth of health care costs and which could significantly transform the market for pharmaceuticals products. We expect further federal and state proposals and health care reforms to continue to be proposed by legislators, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop and may limit our commercial opportunity. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act (the \u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The continuing efforts of government and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunities. In addition, the pendency or approval of such proposals could result in a decrease in the price of our common stock or limit our ability to raise capital or to enter into collaborations or license rights to our products.\nWe compete with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are capable of developing new approaches that could make our products and technology obsolete.\nThe market for therapeutic and commercial products is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. Life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we have. New approaches by these competitors may make our products and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., which may experience corruption. Our activities in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. These risks have increased following the Novozymes Acquisition. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the\nFCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nOur stock price could be volatile, which could cause shareholders to lose part or all of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the common stock of many other companies with similar market capitalizations, is highly volatile. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many life sciences, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur growth potential is changing as we evolve from an organization that was heavily involved in research and development to an organization with a strategic focus on our bioprocessing business.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s decision to focus its efforts on the growth of its core bioprocessing business, the Company has terminated its therapeutic product development activities. The core bioprocessing business on which the Company now focuses will provide growth opportunities that are different than those of a research and development oriented biotechnology company. As a result, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may behave differently than it has historically and, during the shift in our business, may behave in a manner not expected by securities analysts and investors. If the Company\u2019s future business focused on bioprocessing generates results that fall below the revised expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.\nAs a result of these risks, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of any such transaction or deliver the value thereof to our shareholders. If we are unsuccessful in consummating any such transaction, we may be required to reevaluate our business only after we have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, even one that may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as\nrevenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company conducts a large portion of its business in international markets. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, 37% of the Company\u2019s revenue and 31% of its costs and expenses were denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Swedish Kroner, the British pound sterling and the Euro. The Company is exposed to the risk of an increase or decrease in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which could increase the value of our expenses and decrease the value of our revenue when measured in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our results of operation may be influenced by the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations and such effects may have an adverse impact on our common stock price.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible that certain transactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nSection 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. We may be unable to offset our taxable income with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability. We have completed a number of financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Section 382, or could result in a change in control in the future.\nIf we identify a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. For example, in 2012, we updated our internal controls to include our operations in Sweden. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, The NASDAQ Stock Market or other regulatory authorities.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. We must annually evaluate our internal procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management and our independent registered public accounting firm to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system and have recently implemented several significant ERP modules and expect to implement additional ERP modules in the future. The implementation of the ERP system represents a change in our internal control over financial reporting. Although we continue to monitor and assess our internal controls in the new ERP system environment as changes are made and new modules are implemented, and have taken additional steps to modify and enhance the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, there is a risk that deficiencies may occur that could constitute significant deficiencies or in the aggregate a material weakness.\nIf we fail to remedy any deficiencies or maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 10200, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RGEN"}
