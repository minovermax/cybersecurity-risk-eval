Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our business is subject to many risks and our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. Many of the following risks and uncertainties have been and may continue to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the notes accompanying those financial statements and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and stock price. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, before making investment decisions regarding our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which, together with our limited operating history, make it difficult to assess our future viability.\n\u2022\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations.\n\u2022\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\n\u2022\nOur core therapeutic approach to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging is based on our understanding of cellular senescence. Utilizing senolytic molecules to treat diseases of aging is a novel therapeutic approach, which exposes us to unforeseen risks and makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of drug development and potential for regulatory approval.\n\u2022\nOur business is currently dependent on the successful development and regulatory approval of UBX1325.\n\u2022\nOther than UBX1325, all of our other programs are preclinical and face significant development risk.\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, including our clinical trials, and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture preclinical and clinical supplies of our drug candidates and we intend to continue to rely on third parties to produce such preclinical and clinical supplies as well as commercial supplies of any approved product. The loss of these suppliers, costs and availability of inputs or supplies, supply issues whether or not related to the COVID-19 panademic, or the failure of those manufacturers or suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to provide us with\nsufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and our drug candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. Most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and we may not be able to successfully compete.\n\u2022\nOur senolytic medicine platform and any future products that we commercialize could be alleged to infringe patent rights and other proprietary rights of third parties, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and/or limit our ability to commercialize our products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nRisks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Condition, and Capital Requirements\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which, together with our limited operating history, make it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have not yet sought approval for commercial sale of any products and therefore have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from contracts with customers and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in March 2009. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry.\nWe have had significant operating losses since our inception. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $60.7 million and $93.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $400.0 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase as we continue to develop our drug candidates, conduct clinical studies and pursue research and development activities. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Based on our current operating plans, we expect our existing capital resources will fund our planned operating expenses into the first quarter of 2023 which is expected to fund key clinical data readouts for UBX1325, but less than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts, advance our drug candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization. We do not expect to generate revenue from any drug candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such drug candidates and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit opinion for the year ended December 31,\n2021 an explanatory paragraph that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that funding will be available to us, will be obtained on terms favorable to us or will provide us with sufficient funds to meet our objectives. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or enter into partnerships. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities. Preclinical studies and clinical studies for our drug candidates and additional research and development activities to discover and develop new drug candidates will require substantial funds to complete. As of December 31, 2021, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $90.1 million. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with our programs, including the clinical development of UBX1325, and the development of any other drug candidates we may choose to pursue. These expenditures will include costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any preclinical study or clinical study is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates.\nIn February 2022, we announced a restructuring to align resources to focus on our ongoing clinical programs and deliver on key development milestones. These actions to prioritize our ophthalmology programs and implement cost saving measures were designed to enable us to achieve multiple key clinical data readouts for UBX1325 as well as support the Tie2 and Tie2/VEGF bispecific program through advanced candidate nomination, with all other pipeline programs paused to focus resources on these advanced programs.\nBased on our current operating plans, we expect our existing capital resources will fund our planned operating expenses into the first quarter of 2023 which is expected to fund key clinical data readouts for UBX1325, but less than 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. Accordingly, our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We will need substantial additional capital to operate our business and continue our development activities. Our operating plans may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, the imposition of burdensome debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainty and potential for local and/or global economic recession. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, we could be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of our ongoing clinical trials of UBX1325;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our drug candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical studies;\n\u2022\npotential delays in or an increase in costs associated with our ongoing or planned preclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of any additional drug candidates we develop or acquire;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of any milestone payments we are required to make pursuant to our license agreements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\u2022\nthe expenses needed to attract, hire, and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities if our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty or other payments due under any such agreement;\n\u2022\nany product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of any future approved products, if any.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities for our current drug candidates or any future drug candidate;\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development activities; or\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our efforts to establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our current drug candidates or any future drug candidate, or reduce our flexibility in developing or maintaining our sales and marketing strategy.\nWe also could choose or be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We do not expect to realize revenue from sales of products or royalties from licensed products in the foreseeable future, if at all, and unless and until our drug candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully marketed. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and currently intend to do so through collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, financial markets have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainty, and such impact may be exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves or by other unforeseen events or public health emergencies. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted,\nrights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, is likely to involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities received any distribution of our corporate assets.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, making it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and level of investment in research, development and, if approved, commercialization activities relating to our drug candidates, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe timing and status of enrollment for our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our drug candidates, as well as building out our supply chain, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;\n\u2022\nexpenditures we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional drug candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of any milestone, royalty or other payments due under any collaboration or license agreement;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success or failure of preclinical studies and clinical studies for our drug candidates or competing drug candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u2022\nthe timing of receipt of approvals for our drug candidates from regulatory authorities in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our drug candidates, if approved, and potential future drugs that compete with our products;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our products, if approved, which may vary significantly over time; and\n\u2022\npotential disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue or earnings guidance we may provide.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Product Development\nOur core therapeutic approach to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging is based on our understanding of cellular senescence. Utilizing senolytic molecules to treat diseases of aging is a novel therapeutic approach, which exposes us to unforeseen risks and makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of drug development and potential for regulatory approval.\nOur foundational science and lead drug candidate are based on senescence biology. We believe that we can develop drug candidates capable of eliminating or modulating accumulated senescent cells, when administered locally. In our development efforts we intend to explore senolytic medicines that use multiple modalities. However, our approach to treating diseases of aging is novel and the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to develop senolytic medicines is ongoing. We have only recently begun testing our senolytic molecules in humans and the majority of our current data supporting our hypothesis regarding senescence biology is limited to pre-clinical animal models and in vitro cell lines, the results of which may not translate into humans. We currently have no conclusive evidence in humans, that the accumulation or modulation of senescent cells is the underlying cause of tissue damage and dysfunction associated with many diseases of aging. For example, we announced the 12-week results from our Phase 2 study of UBX0101 in patients with moderate-to-severe painful OA of the knee. There was no statistically significant difference between any arm of UBX0101 and placebo at the 12-week primary endpoint for change from baseline in WOMAC-A, an established measurement of pain in OA. Given these results, we are not progressing UBX0101 into pivotal studies and have narrowed our near-term focus to our ongoing ophthalmologic and neurologic disease programs.\nOur current program, UBX1325, is a Bcl-xL inhibitor, and is intended to target senescent cells in the eye. While cellular senescence is a naturally occurring biological process, the administration of senolytic medicines to eliminate or cause the elimination or modulation of accumulated senescent cells in humans has not been widely tested and may potentially harm healthy tissue or result in unforeseen safety events, or fail to achieve the intended therapeutic purpose entirely. We may also ultimately discover that our senolytic molecules do not possess certain properties required for therapeutic effectiveness, or that even if found to be effective in one type of tissue, that such molecules will be effective in other tissues. In addition, given the novel nature of this therapeutic approach, designing preclinical and clinical studies to demonstrate the effect of senolytic medicines is complex and exposes us to unforeseen risks. In addition, the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing systemic senolytic medicines is based primarily on preclinical data and not human clinical trials. We may spend substantial funds attempting to develop these drug candidates and never succeed in doing so.\nNo regulatory authority has granted approval for a senolytic medicine. As such, we believe the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has limited experience with senescence, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the clinical development and regulatory approval process for our drug candidates. We may never receive approval to market and commercialize any drug candidate. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, the approval may be for targets, disease indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical studies to obtain approval or be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain marketing authorization. If our other senolytic molecules prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our entire senolytic platform and pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is currently dependent on the successful development of UBX1325 which is in early stages of clinical development.\nWe have no products approved for sale and all of our drug candidates are in early stages of development. We have one product candidate, UBX1325, in clinical development and we have ceased development of UBX0101 following our Phase 2 trial and are focused on advancing our ophthalmology program. In particular, in October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study of UBX1325 in patients with DME or nAMD for whom anti-VEGF therapy was no longer considered beneficial, and in July, October, and November 2021, we announced positive data up to 24 weeks from this Phase 1 study. We initiated a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical study of UBX1325 in DME in May 2021 and dosed the first patient in June 2021 and expect 12-week safety and efficacy data by mid-2022. In March 2022 we also enrolled our first patient in our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in nAMD, and we expect to share 16-week\ndata in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the timing of study initiations, enrollment, visit adherence, and completions is hard to assess due the continually evolving nature of the situation and it is possible that the study enrollment, visit adherence, and completion may be delayed.\nIn February 2022, we announced a restructuring to align resources to focus on our ongoing clinical programs and deliver on key development milestones. These actions to prioritize our ophthalmology programs and implement cost saving measures were designed to enable us to achieve multiple key clinical data readouts for UBX1325. As a result, our business is currently dependent on the successful development of UBX1325. The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, will primarily depend on the successful development of UBX1325. If UBX1325 does not demonstrate clinical benefit or we encounter safety issues with UBX1325, we may be required to significantly delay or abandon its development. In the event UBX1325 is not successful in clinical development, we have limited resources and capital with which to develop additional drug candidates and we may be forced to sell or liquidate our business.\nThe clinical and commercial success of UBX1325 and any other future drug candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to raise any additional required capital on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete IND-enabling studies and successfully submit an IND or comparable applications in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntimely completion of our preclinical studies and clinical studies, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors, some of whom could be adversely impacted by unforeseen events such as pandemics and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nwhether we are required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical studies or other studies beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates;\n\u2022\nacceptance of our proposed indications and primary endpoint assessments relating to the proposed indications of our drug candidates by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities the safety, efficacy, and acceptable risk-to-benefit profile of our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects or other safety issues experienced with our drug candidates or future approved products, if any;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nachieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that our third-party contractors achieve and maintain compliance with our contractual obligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates or approved products, if any;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians, professional societies, operators of clinics, hospitals, and patients to recommend, utilize, or adopt any of our future drug candidates to treat diseases of aging;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture adequate clinical study and commercial supplies of our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop a commercial strategy and thereafter commercialize our drug candidates or any future drug candidates in the United States, and internationally, if approved for marketing, reimbursement, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nthe convenience of our treatment or dosing regimen;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, payors, and patients of the benefits, safety, and efficacy of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates, if approved, including relative to alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022\npatient demand for our drug candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to our drug candidates or any future drug candidates; and\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference, intellectual property challenges, or intellectual property infringement claims.\nThese factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause us to experience significant delays or be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our drug candidates. In addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in developing, obtaining regulatory approvals for or commercializing our product candidates. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never achieve success in commercializing any of our drug candidates. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates to continue our business or achieve profitability.\nOther than UBX1325, all of our other programs are preclinical and face significant development risk.\nOther than UBX1325, all of our other programs are in preclinical and early research stage. In addition, we have limited resources for which to develop any products other than UBX1325. Given the early stage nature of these programs, each of the drug candidates and programs faces substantial development risk. UBX0101 and UBX1325 are the only drug candidates that we have administered to humans, and as such, we face significant translational risk with our earlier stage drug candidates. We may also be required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional preclinical studies beyond those planned to support the commencement of additional clinical trials. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we are able to bring any of our preclinical product candidates or development programs into the clinic or otherwise successfully develop them.\nClinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical study process. Success in preclinical studies and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will be successful. A number of companies in the biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical studies, even after positive results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical studies. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. The results of our preclinical animal studies or studies in ex vivo human tissues may not be predictive of the results of outcomes in human clinical studies. For example, our senolytic molecules may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies or may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen or harmful ways.\nDrug candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired pharmacological properties or safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical studies. Notwithstanding any promising results in earlier studies, we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if we are\nable to initiate and complete clinical studies, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that studies or trials for our drug candidates will begin on time, not require redesign, enroll an adequate number of subjects on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The COVID-19 pandemic could cause or exacerbate these factors. For example, for our Phase 1 and Phase 2a or Phase 2 studies for UBX1325, clinical sites may be unable to recruit and retain investigators and study staff, screen and enroll patients, patients may be unable to adhere to the study visit schedule, and the completion of the study could be delayed. Clinical studies can be prolonged, delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing with or requiring changes to the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence or continue a trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each trial site;\n\u2022\nrecruiting an adequate number of suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\nhaving subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nencountering difficulties in gathering the range of biological data from patients needed to fully assess the impact of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\naddressing subject safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding a sufficient number of clinical study sites; or\n\u2022\nobtaining sufficient product supply of drug candidate for use in preclinical studies or clinical studies from third-party suppliers some of whom could be adversely impacted by unforeseen events such as pandemics and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may experience numerous adverse or unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical studies and clinical studies that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our drug candidates, including:\n\u2022\nclinical studies of our drug candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to modify clinical study design, conduct additional clinical studies or abandon drug development programs, including all of our senolytic programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical studies of our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical studies at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, fail to maintain adequate quality controls, or be unable to provide us with sufficient product supply to conduct and complete preclinical studies or clinical studies of our drug candidates in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe or our investigators might have to suspend or terminate clinical studies of our drug candidates for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, a finding that our drug candidates have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, or due to unforeseen events such as pandemics and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical studies of our drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe quality of our drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct preclinical studies or clinical studies of our drug candidates may be inadequate;\n\u2022\nregulators may revise the requirements for approving our drug candidates, or such requirements may not be as we anticipate; and\n\u2022\nfuture collaborators may conduct clinical studies in ways they view as advantageous to them but that are suboptimal for us.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical studies or other testing of our drug candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical studies of our drug candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only moderately positive, or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nincur unplanned costs;\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our drug candidates or fail to obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the treatment removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical study is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical study due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical study in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical study operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study.\nFurther, conducting clinical studies in foreign countries, as we may do for certain of our drug candidates, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical studies. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries, including those caused by unforeseen events such as pandemics and public health emergencies similar to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrincipal investigators for our clinical studies may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or a regulatory authority concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical study site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical study itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of the marketing application we submit. Any such delay or rejection could prevent or delay us from commercializing our current or future drug candidates.\nIf we experience termination or delays in the completion of any preclinical study or clinical study of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues from any of these drug candidates will be delayed or unrealized. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical studies may increase our costs, slow down our drug candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our drug candidates. If one or more of our drug candidates or our senescence technology generally prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our platform and pipeline would have significantly diminished value, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, including our clinical trials, and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, facilities and production have been suspended, and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. In response to the spread of COVID-19, as of mid-March 2020, we transitioned to a reduced onsite staffing model and implemented a remote work plan for all of our employees other than those providing essential services, such as our laboratory staff. In parallel with applicable law and regulations, in June 2021 and again in February 2022 we began transitioning our staff back to the office but are continuing to monitor and adjust as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. For onsite employees, we have implemented heightened safety measures designed to comply with applicable federal, state and local guidelines. We may be required to take additional actions that could impact our operations if required by applicable laws or regulations or if we determine them to be in the best interests of our employees.\nFor the Phase 1 safety and tolerability clinical study and the Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical studies for UBX1325, we adapted the clinical study protocol and standard operating procedures to enable a number of adaptations such as: remote data collection for clinical sites if needed; the option for remote data source verification procedures to limit on-site monitoring; transportation options for patients to utilize for study visit adherence; flexible visit windows to increase study visit adherence; and geographic distribution of sites to mitigate variation in local restrictions.\nThese actions enable the collection of all major endpoints if patients adhere with the study visit schedule. Assessments that require an on-site visit may be missed for some or all patients including laboratory evaluations, clinical examinations, or imaging.\nAlthough one of the manufacturers in our supply chain for UBX0101 experienced a two-week shutdown in April 2020 due to a COVID-19 related incident and there have been some delays in shipments due to a reduction in overall flights, neither of these factors impacted our supply of UBX0101 prior to our decision to shut down further clinical advancement of that program. There have been no other disruptions in our supply chain of drug manufacturers necessary to conduct our ongoing clinical trials, including our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in ophthalmology disease.\nSeveral of the contract research organizations, or CROs, that provide preclinical services to us are based in China and India and experienced temporary shutdowns in February and March due to government mandates. In each case we were able to reassign the balance of activities to other CROs and the shutdowns did not impact our preclinical timelines. CROs based in the United States that provide preclinical services are experiencing heavy demand, which\nmay impact their ability to start new studies and could lead to delays in the commencement of our preclinical studies. Several of our U.S.-based academic research partners have also experienced shutdowns which has slowed progress on several early-stage projects, none of which impacted our preclinical timelines.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022\ndiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data;\n\u2022\nrisk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will contract the COVID-19 coronavirus while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u2022\nlimitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022\ndelays in receiving authorizations from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product used in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue such clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022\ninterruptions, delays, or increased costs in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations or supplies at our research and development laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\ndelays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; and\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States.\nThe global pandemic of the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to evolve. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, including our clinical trials, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the adoption and efficacy of vaccines, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical studies, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe timely completion of clinical studies in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical studies for a variety of reasons. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, some of which could be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u2022\npatients\u2019 fear of visiting or traveling to trial sites during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical study investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents.\nIn addition, our clinical studies may compete with other clinical studies for drug candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our drug candidates. This competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we may conduct some of our clinical studies at the same clinical study sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical studies in such clinical study site.\nFurther, the administration of senolytic medicines designed to eliminate or cause the elimination of senescent cells and thereby modulate their associated SASP may result in unforeseen events, including by harming healthy tissues. As a result, it is possible that safety concerns could negatively affect patient enrollment among the patient populations that we intend to treat, including among those in indications with a low risk of mortality. Delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical studies, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our drug candidates.\nInterim, \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose top-line or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the top-line or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the top-line or preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may conduct are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product, our ability to make certain claims about our products, and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure.\nIf the interim, top-line or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nOur drug candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Other than our clinical studies of UBX0101 and UBX1325, senolytic medicines designed to eliminate or cause the elimination of senescent cells have never been tested in humans. As a result, although UBX1325 has been well tolerated in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies with no adversities that would prevent advancement into later stage clinical trials as of March 2022, UBX1325 could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects, and it is possible that patients enrolled in such clinical studies could respond in unexpected ways. For instance, in preclinical in vivo animal and ex vivo human tissue studies, our senolytic molecules have exhibited clearance of senescent cells; however, the elimination of accumulated senescent cells may result in unforeseen events, including harming healthy cells or tissues. In addition, the entry by cells into a senescent state is a natural biological process that we believe may have protective effects, such as halting the proliferation of damaged cells. The treatment of tissues with senolytic molecules could interfere with such protective processes.\nIf unacceptable side effects arise in the development of our drug candidates, we, the FDA, the IRBs at the institutions in which our studies are conducted, or the DSMB could suspend or terminate our clinical studies, or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease clinical studies or deny approval of our drug candidates for any or all targeted indications. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete any of our clinical studies or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. We expect to have to train medical personnel using our drug candidates to understand the side effect profiles for our clinical studies and upon any commercialization of any of our drug candidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our drug candidates could result in patient injury or death. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIn addition, even if we successfully advance any of our drug candidates into and through clinical studies, such trials will likely only include a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure to our drug candidates. As a result, we cannot be assured that adverse effects of our drug candidates will not be uncovered when a significantly larger number of patients are exposed to the drug candidate. Further, clinical studies may not be sufficient to determine the effect and safety consequences of taking our drug candidates over a multi-year period. There can be no assurance that it will demonstrate a similarly favorable safety profile in subsequent clinical trials.\nIf any of our drug candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u2022\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of the foregoing events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular drug candidate, if approved, and result in the loss of significant revenues to us, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and business. In addition, if one or more of our drug candidates or our senescence approach generally prove to be unsafe, our entire platform and pipeline could be affected, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to continue to create a pipeline of drug candidates or to develop commercially successful products. If we fail to successfully identify and develop additional drug candidates, our commercial opportunity may be limited.\nWe are committed to developing senolytic medicines that slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging, and we are currently advancing multiple senolytic molecules to address a variety of diseases of aging, including ophthalmologic disorders. As senolytic medicines are not limited to intervention by a single mode of action or molecular target, we believe that we can modulate a number of biologic pathways in order to trigger the beneficial elimination of senescent cells. However, our core therapeutic approach is based on our belief that senescent cells drive diseases of aging, and that hypothesis has not yet been proven. In addition, we do not know if we will be able to develop medicines that selectively eliminate senescent cells or whether the elimination of such senescent cells will mitigate the effects of or effectively treat any diseases.\nIn addition, identifying, developing, obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing drug candidates for the treatment of diseases of aging will require substantial additional funding and is prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Research programs to identify drug candidates also require substantial technical, financial and human resources, regardless of whether or not any drug candidates are ultimately identified, and even if our preclinical research programs initially show promise in identifying potential drug candidates, they may fail to yield drug candidates for clinical development.\nWhile we have a number of ongoing drug discovery programs targeting senescent cells, we do not know whether these will be successful, or whether we will be able to identify novel senolytic mechanisms to continue to build our pipeline. We also cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully identify or acquire additional drug candidates, advance any of these additional drug candidates through the development process, successfully commercialize any such additional drug candidates, if approved, or assemble sufficient resources to identify, acquire, develop or, if approved, commercialize additional drug candidates. If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional drug candidates, our commercial opportunities may be limited.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The denial or delay of any such approval would delay commercialization of our drug candidates and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.\nTo gain approval to market our drug candidates, we must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for the intended indication applied for in the applicable regulatory filing. For our senolytic medicines, we must also demonstrate that eliminating or causing the elimination of senescent cells and modulating relevant associated SASP factors will lead to the improvement of well-defined and measurable endpoints.\nWe have not previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA, or similar approval filings to comparable foreign regulatory authorities. An NDA, BLA or other relevant regulatory filing must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the drug candidate is safe and effective, or that a biological drug candidate is safe, pure and potent for each desired indication. The NDA, BLA or other relevant regulatory submission must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing, and distribution of drug and biologic products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States or in any foreign countries until they receive the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities of such jurisdictions.\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of our drug candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that any of our drug candidates is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with our trial protocol or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of any of our drug candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve the formulation, labeling or specifications of our current or future drug candidates, including UBX1325;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers upon which we rely; or\n\u2022\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner that renders our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval from the FDA or applicable foreign agencies for any of our drug candidates, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical studies which may be required after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve our current drug candidates for limited indications or narrower patient populations than we originally requested, and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulatory agency,\nmay not approve our drug candidates with the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of such drug candidates.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of our drug candidates and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nEven if our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.\nEven if one or more of our drug candidates receive FDA or other regulatory approvals, the commercial success of any of our current or future drug candidates will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians and patients for approved indications. Our drug candidates may not be commercially successful for a variety of reasons, including: competitive factors, pricing or physician preference, reimbursement by insurers, the degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or future drug candidates. If approved, the commercial success of our drug candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications;\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of our product as compared to other available therapies;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans, insurers and other healthcare payors for any of our drug candidates that may be approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, operators of clinics, and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nphysician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available therapies to treat approved indications;\n\u2022\novercoming any biases physicians or patients may have toward particular therapies for the treatment of approved indications;\n\u2022\nproper training and administration of our drug candidates by physicians and medical staff;\n\u2022\npublic misperception regarding the use of our therapies, or public bias against \u201canti-aging\u201d companies;\n\u2022\npatient satisfaction with the results and administration of our drug candidates and overall treatment experience, including, for example, the convenience of any dosing regimen;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment with our drug candidates in relation to alternative treatments and reimbursement levels, if any, and willingness to pay for the product, if approved, on the part of insurance companies and other third-party payers, physicians and patients;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay for certain of our products, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe revenue and profitability that our products may offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of side effects;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our products;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians, operators of clinics and patients to utilize or adopt our products as a solution;\n\u2022\nany FDA requirement to undertake a REMS;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about our products or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims.\nWe cannot assure you that our current or future drug candidates, if approved, will achieve broad market acceptance among physicians and patients. Any failure by our drug candidates that obtain regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture supplies of our drug candidates and we intend to continue to rely on third parties to produce such preclinical and clinical supplies as well as commercial supplies of any approved product. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to provide us with sufficient quantities at acceptable quality levels or prices, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not have the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture supplies of our drug candidates or the materials necessary to produce our drug candidates for use in the conduct of our clinical studies, and we lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any of our drug candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our drug candidates are subject to various regulatory requirements and may be subject to the inspection of the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as cGMPs. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions, we may not be able to rely on their manufacturing facilities for the manufacture or our drug candidates. In addition, we have limited control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority finds these facilities inadequate for the manufacture of our drug candidates or if such facilities are subject to enforcement action in the future or are otherwise inadequate, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our drug candidates.\nWe currently intend to supply all of our drug candidates in all territories for our planned clinical development programs. We currently rely on third parties at key stages in our supply chain. For instance, the supply chains for our current drug candidates involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, specifically, raw materials manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing and drug product manufacturing. As a result, the supply chain for the manufacturing of our drug candidates is complicated and we expect the logistical challenges associated with our supply chain to grow more complex as our drug candidates progress through the clinical trial process. Some of these third parties may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies. For example, one of the manufacturers in our supply chain for UBX0101 experienced a two-week shutdown in April 2020 due to a COVID-19 related incident. While such incident did not impact our supply of UBX0101 for clinical studies being conducted in April 2020, there can be no assurance that our supply chain for any of our candidates and clinical trials will not be disrupted in the future due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition or manufacture of materials by our manufacturers. Further, we have not yet engaged any manufacturers for the commercial supply of our current drug candidates. Although we intend to enter into such agreements prior to commercial launch of any of our drug candidates, we may be unable to enter into any such agreement or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business. We generally do not begin a preclinical study and we do not intend to initiate any clinical studies unless we believe we have access to a sufficient supply of a drug candidate to complete such study or trial. In addition, any significant delay in, or quality control problems with respect to, the supply of a drug candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing study or trial could considerably delay completion of our preclinical studies or future clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our drug candidates.\nMoreover, if there is a disruption to one or more of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 relevant operations, or if we are unable to enter into arrangements for the commercial supply of our drug candidates, we will have no other means of producing our current drug candidates until they restore the affected facilities or we or they procure alternative manufacturing facilities or sources of supply. Our ability to progress our preclinical and clinical programs could be materially and adversely impacted if any of the third-party suppliers upon which we rely were to experience a significant business challenge, disruption or failure due to issues such as financial difficulties or bankruptcy, issues relating to other customers such as regulatory or quality compliance issues, or other financial, legal, regulatory or reputational issues.\nAdditionally, any damage to or destruction of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to manufacture our drug candidates on a timely basis.\nIn addition, to manufacture our current drug candidates in the quantities that we believe would be required to meet anticipated market demand, our third-party manufacturers would likely need to increase manufacturing capacity and, in some cases, we would need to secure alternative sources of commercial supply, which could involve significant challenges and may require additional regulatory approvals. In addition, the development of commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities may require us and our third-party manufacturers to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain the technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. Neither we nor our third-party manufacturers may successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing capacity in a timely manner, or at all. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our drug candidates on acceptable terms, at sufficient quality levels, or in adequate quantities, if at all, the commercial launch of our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such drug candidates, if approved.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates, conduct our clinical studies and commercialize our current or any future drug candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and employees. In February 2022 we announced a restructuring to advance corporate strategy and focus on key ophthalmology programs. As a result, additional unplanned loss of personnel, may occur despite our efforts to retain management and employees. Continued disruption caused by the transition or by the loss of ongoing services of any other members of our management or employees could delay or prevent the successful development of our ongoing programs, initiation or completion of our planned clinical studies or the commercialization of our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry, and we may not be able to adequately address attrition, including unplanned, attrition, and as a result, the timely completion of our clinical trials could be jeopardized.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for key raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, and the loss of these third-party suppliers or their inability to supply us with adequate raw materials could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the raw materials required for the production of our drug candidates. Our dependence on these third-party suppliers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, and quality and delivery schedules. As a small company, our negotiation leverage is limited, and we are likely to get lower priority than our competitors who are larger than we are. We cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our drug candidates until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates, including limiting supplies necessary for clinical studies and regulatory approvals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third parties in the conduct of critical portions of our preclinical studies and intend to rely on third parties in the conduct of critical portions of our future clinical studies. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. Some of these third parties may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies.\nWe currently do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies that comply with the regulatory requirements known as good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements. We also do not currently have the ability to independently conduct any clinical studies. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical studies, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical studies. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct GLP-compliant preclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical studies on our drug candidates properly and on time. While we have agreements governing their activities, we control only certain aspects of their activities and have limited influence over their actual performance. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our GLP-compliant preclinical studies and our GCP-compliant clinical studies play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our GLP-compliant preclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical studies, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP preclinical studies and clinical studies is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nMany of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, potentially including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. If the third parties conducting our preclinical studies or our clinical studies do not adequately perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience significant business challenges, disruptions or failures, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our protocols or to GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our preclinical studies or clinical studies may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated. As a result, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable drug candidate, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and our drug candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration. Most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and we may not be able to successfully compete.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in particular are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. We face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, clinical study expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for drug candidates and other resources than we do. Some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in\nrecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. In addition, certain of our drug candidates, if approved, may compete with other products that treat diseases of aging, including over the counter, or OTC, treatments, for a share of some patients\u2019 discretionary budgets and for physicians\u2019 attention within their clinical practices.\nWe are aware of other companies seeking to develop treatments to prevent or treat diseases of aging through various biological pathways. Within our lead senolytic program in ophthalmology diseases, our drug candidates would compete against current therapies from a wide range of companies and technologies, including current standard of care treatments such as anti-VEGF antibodies (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, brolucizumab), bispecific antibodies (faricimab), intravitreal steroid (dexamethasone), and pan-retinal photocoagulation by laser. There are also potentially disease-modifying therapeutics being developed by several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Roche/Genentech and Regeneron.\nFurther, we believe that potential competitors may be able to develop senolytic medicines utilizing well-established molecules and pathways, which could enable the development of competitive drug candidates utilizing the same cellular senescence biological theories.\nCertain alternative treatments offered by competitors may be available at lower prices and may offer greater efficacy or better safety profiles. Furthermore, currently approved products could be discovered to have application for treatment of diseases of aging generally, which could give such products significant regulatory and market timing advantages over any of our drug candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA for indications our drug candidates are targeting, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Newly developed systemic or non-systemic treatments that replace existing therapies that currently are only utilized in patients suffering from severe disease may also have lessened side effects or reduced prices compared to current therapies, which make them more attractive for patients suffering from mild to moderate disease. Even if a generic or OTC product is less effective than our drug candidates, it may be more quickly adopted by physicians and patients than our competing drug candidates based upon cost or convenience.\nThe successful commercialization of our drug candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish adequate coverage, reimbursement levels and pricing policies. Failure to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford prescription medications such as our drug candidates, assuming FDA approval. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for products by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates. Assuming we obtain coverage for our drug candidates by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available for our drug candidates or any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nThird-party payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs or biologics when an equivalent generic drug, biosimilar or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our drug candidates as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the cost of the less expensive product. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our drug candidates, pricing of existing third-party therapeutics may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our drug candidates. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our drug candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may\nnot be able to successfully commercialize our drug candidates and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our investment in the development of drug candidates.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models in the United States for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. We cannot predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates.\nNo uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our drug candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries have and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our drug candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products but monitor and control company profits.\nAdditional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our drug candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our drug candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our drug candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our drug candidates due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nWe currently have no sales organization. If we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell our drug candidates effectively in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales organization. In order to commercialize our drug candidates in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If any of our drug candidates receive regulatory approval, we expect to establish a sales organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize each such drug candidate, which will be expensive and time consuming. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain, and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We may choose to\ncollaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our drug candidates. If we are not successful in commercializing our drug candidates or any future drug candidates, either on our own or through arrangements with one or more third parties, we may not be able to generate any future product revenue and we would incur significant additional losses.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our current or future drug candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our drug candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, and a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranty. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our drug candidates.\nEven a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our current or future drug candidates;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our current or any future drug candidates.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our current or any future drug candidates we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. If and when we obtain approval for marketing any of our drug candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of such drug candidate; however, we may be unable to obtain this liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur existing collaborations as well as additional collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe utilize external collaborations and currently maintain several active early-stage research and discovery focused collaborations. In the future, we may seek additional collaboration arrangements for the commercialization, or potentially for the development, of certain of our drug candidates depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into collaboration arrangements. To the extent that we decide to enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future, we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and maintain and challenging to manage. We may not be successful in our efforts to prudently manage our existing collaborations or to enter new ones should we chose to do so. The terms of new collaborations, or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nThe success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators and partners. Collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include risks that:\n\u2022\ncollaborators and partners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaborations and they may not devote the level of effort or resources we expect;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our drug candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical study results, changes in their strategic focus due to their acquisition of competitive products or their internal development of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical studies, provide insufficient funding for a clinical study program, stop a clinical study, abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical studies or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or drug candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing, manufacturing, and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to or otherwise not perform satisfactorily in carrying out these activities;\n\u2022\nwe could grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our current or future drug candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated, resulting in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable current or future drug candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaborations;\n\u2022\na collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings; and\n\u2022\ncollaborators may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 or other unforeseen events and public health emergencies.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur senolytic medicine platform and any future products that we commercialize could be alleged to infringe patent rights and other proprietary rights of third parties, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and/or limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to develop, manufacture and market our senolytic medicines and future drug candidates and use our proprietary technology without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. As the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we may need to challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated.\nWhether merited or not, we may face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including patents held by our competitors or by non-practicing entities. We may also face allegations that our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property rights of their former employers or other third parties.\nLitigation may make it necessary to defend ourselves by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have merit, the claims can be time consuming, divert management attention and financial resources and are costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop treating certain conditions, obtain licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or may result in significant settlement costs. For example, litigation can involve substantial damages for infringement (and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees), and the court could prohibit us from selling or licensing our products unless the third-party licenses rights to us, which it is not required to do at a commercially reasonable price or at all. If a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products. We may also have to redesign our products so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible at all or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our products may not be available for manufacture, use, or sale.\nIn addition, patent applications in the United States and many international jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the filing of certain priority documents (or, in some cases, are not published until they issue as patents) and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Thus, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications or made public disclosures relating to our technology or our contemplated technology. A third party may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, depending on whether the timing of the filing date falls under certain patent laws, we may have to participate in a priority contest (such as an interference proceeding) declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of patent and other proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if it is\ndetermined that the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. Although we are not currently subject to any claims from third parties asserting infringement of their intellectual property rights, in the future, we may receive claims from third parties asserting infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to establish our intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance with respect to the outcome of any current or future litigation brought by or against us, and the outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and outcomes are uncertain. Further, as the costs and outcome of these types of claims and proceedings can vary significantly, it is difficult to estimate potential losses that may occur. Accordingly, we are unable at this time to estimate the effects of these potential future lawsuits on our financial condition, operations or cash flows.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Finally, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection directed to our senolytic medicine platform and any future technologies that we develop, others may be able to make, use, or sell products substantially the same as ours, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nAs of March 1, 2022, we own, co-own, or have an exclusive license in certain fields of use to more than 150 patents and pending applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. This portfolio includes 47 issued and allowed U.S. patents and applications and 38 granted and allowed foreign patents and applications, respectively. A composition of matter patent filing claiming the specific chemical structure of UBX1325 was issued in the U.S. on April 20, 2021, which will extend our loss of exclusivity on this molecule to 2039, not including any patent term adjustment or patent term extensions to which it may be entitled.\nWe have not pursued or maintained, and may not pursue or maintain in the future, patent protection for our products in every country or territory in which we may sell our products. In addition, we cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications or pending trademark applications will issue or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, international patent offices or judicial bodies may deny or significantly narrow claims made under our patent applications and our issued patents may be successfully challenged, may be designed around, or may otherwise be of insufficient scope to provide us with protection for our commercial products. Further, the USPTO, international trademark offices or judicial bodies may deny our trademark applications and, even if published or registered, these trademarks may not effectively protect our brand and goodwill. Like patents, trademarks also may be successfully opposed or challenged.\nWe cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or unauthorized reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, third parties may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours and such competitive technologies may or may not infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against these infringers in the respective country or forum, but these actions may not be successful. As with all granted intellectual property, such intellectual property may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, may not provide specific protection and/or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against specific alleged infringers.\nThe market for biopharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and treatments for diseases of aging is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development and protection of technologies and products for use in these fields and upon our ability\nto obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights in connection therewith. We seek to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products that misappropriate our technology and/or infringe our intellectual property to unfairly and illegally compete with our products. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be harmed, as third parties may be able to make, use, or sell products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the sizeable development and licensing costs that we have incurred, which would adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nWe use a combination of patents, trademarks, know-how, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these protections may not be adequate and may not provide us with any competitive advantage. For example, patents may not issue from any of our currently pending or any future patent applications, and our issued patents and any future patents that may issue may not survive legal challenges to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us.\nIf we or one of our current or future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our current drug candidates or future drug candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace.\nGrounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or nonenablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nWith respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our drug candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEven if our patents are determined by a court to be valid and enforceable, they may not be interpreted sufficiently broadly to prevent others from marketing products similar to ours or designing around our patents. For example, third parties may be able to make products that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of our patents. Third parties may assert that we or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications. The claims of our issued patents or patent applications when issued may not cover our proposed commercial technologies or the future products that we develop. We may not have freedom to commercialize unimpeded by the patent rights of others. Third parties may have dominating, blocking, or other patents relevant to our technology of which we are not aware. There may be prior public disclosures or art that could be deemed to invalidate one or more of our patent claims. Further, we may not develop additional proprietary technologies in the future, and, if we do, they may not be patentable.\nPatent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many international jurisdictions, policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, international courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents, our ability to obtain patents or the patents and patent applications of our licensors. Patent reform legislation in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act included a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switch the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other\nrequirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have a number of international patents and patent applications and expect to continue to pursue patent protection in many of the significant markets in which we intend to do business. The laws of some international jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining, protecting, and defending such rights in international jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nVarying filing dates in international countries may also permit intervening third parties to allege priority to certain technology.\nPatent terms may be shortened or lengthened by, for example, terminal disclaimers, patent term adjustments, supplemental protection certificates, and patent term extensions. Patent term extensions and supplemental protection certificates, and the like, may be impacted by the regulatory process and may not significantly lengthen the patent term. Non-payment or delay in payment of patent fees or annuities, delay in patent filings or delay in extension filing (including any patent term extension or adjustment filing), whether intentional or unintentional, may also result in the loss of patent rights important to our business. Certain countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to other parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against other parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of any patents.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect confidential information and proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our confidential information or proprietary technology and processes. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our confidential information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, in which case we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. We may in the future rely on trade secret protection, which would be subject to the risks identified above with respect to confidential information.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we review our competitors\u2019 products, and may in the future seek to enforce our patents or other rights against potential infringement. However, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. Any inability to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our product or service features, which could reduce demand for our products. In addition, we may need to defend our patents from third-party challenges, such as (but not limited to) interferences, derivation\nproceedings, reexamination proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, third-party submissions, oppositions, nullity actions or other patent proceedings. We may need to initiate infringement claims or litigation.\nAdverse proceedings such as litigation can be expensive, time consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical and managerial personnel, which could in turn harm our business, whether or not we receive a determination favorable to us. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court or other judicial body may decide that the patent we seek to enforce is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that the patent in question does not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Some of our competitors may be able to devote significantly more resources to intellectual property litigation and may have significantly broader patent portfolios to assert against us if we assert our rights against them. Further, because of the substantial discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be disclosed or otherwise compromised during litigation.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses in relation to obtaining intellectual property, enforcing intellectual property and/or defending intellectual property, which could affect operating expenses. Our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent and trademark claims and other intellectual property-related costs, including adverse proceedings (such as litigation) costs.\nOur intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary information and technology adequately. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary information, technology, and know-how, our employees, consultants, contractors and outside scientific advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our proprietary information, technology or know-how is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect proprietary information, technology, and know-how. We rely, in part, on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect our proprietary information, technology, and know-how. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Moreover, others may independently develop similar or equivalent proprietary information, and third parties may otherwise gain access to our proprietary knowledge.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nIf our drug candidates are approved, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety, efficacy, and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any approved marketing application. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control.\nWe will have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs and biologics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. The holder of an approved application must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. We could also be asked to conduct post-marketing clinical studies to verify the safety and efficacy of our products in general or in specific patient subsets. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, such regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nMoreover, the policies of the FDA and of other regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. We cannot\npredict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf any of our small molecule drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, additional competitors could enter the market with generic versions of such drugs, which may result in a material decline in sales of affected products.\nUnder the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of an approved, small molecule innovator product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit a new drug application, or NDA, under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that references the FDA\u2019s prior approval of the small molecule innovator product. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and review) of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d known as the Orange Book. If there are patents listed in the Orange Book for a product, a generic or 505(b)(2) applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents must include in their applications what is known as a \u201cParagraph IV\u201d certification, challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given to the patent owner and NDA holder and if, within 45 days of receiving notice, either the patent owner or NDA holder sues for patent infringement, approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA is stayed for up to 30 months.\nAccordingly, if any of our small molecule drug candidates, such as UBX1325, are approved, competitors could file ANDAs for generic versions of our small molecule drug products or 505(b)(2) NDAs that reference our small molecule drug products. If there are patents listed for our small molecule drug products in the Orange Book, those ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs would be required to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating whether the ANDA applicant does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict which, if any, patents in our current portfolio or patents we may obtain in the future will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would address such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents, or the outcome of any such suit.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products and technologies we develop or license. Moreover, if any of our owned or in-licensed patents that are listed in the Orange Book are successfully challenged by way of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent litigation, the affected product could immediately face generic competition and its sales would likely decline rapidly and materially.\nAny biologic, or large molecule, drug candidates for which we intend to seek approval may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nIf we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize any biologic drug candidate faster than our competitors, such drug candidates may face competition from biosimilar products. In the United States, large molecule drug candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologic products subject to approval under the biologics license application, or BLA, pathway. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products following the approval of an original BLA. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty.\nMoreover, the extent to which a biosimilar product, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. In addition, a competitor could decide to forego the biosimilar approval path and submit a full BLA after completing its own preclinical studies and clinical studies. In such cases, any exclusivity to which we may be eligible under the BPCIA would not prevent the competitor from marketing its product as soon as it is approved.\nIf competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our large molecule drug candidates, if approved, such products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and potential adverse consequences. Such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in each indication for which our drug candidates may have received approval.\nEnacted and future healthcare legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and may affect the prices we may set.\nIn the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA, those of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries include the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, non-deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents (other than those designated as orphan drugs), which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nextension of a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022\ncreation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, once empaneled, will have the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law unless overruled by a supermajority vote of Congress; and\n\u2022\nestablishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA that may impact our business or financial condition.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nIndividual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drug candidates or put pressure on our product pricing. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our drug candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most European Union member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize our drug candidates, if approved. In markets outside of the United States and European Union, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the United States, the European Union or any other jurisdiction. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our drug candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur business operations and current and future relationships with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient organizations and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our drug candidates, if approved.\nSuch laws include:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under U.S. federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Public Health Service Act, which prohibits, among other things, the introduction into interstate commerce of a biological product unless a biologics license is in effect for that product;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare providers starting in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nanalogous U.S. state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor,\nincluding private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and\n\u2022\nsimilar healthcare laws and regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nU.S. tax legislation and future changes to applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, or interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, any of which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. We are currently unable to predict whether such changes will occur and, if so, the ultimate impact on our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, our suppliers or our customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report and others such as:\n\u2022\nresults from, and any delays in, commencing, conducting or completing our clinical studies for our current drug candidates, or any other future clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements by academic or other third parties challenging the fundamental premises underlying our approach to treating diseases of aging and/or drug development;\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory approval or disapproval of our current or any future drug candidates;\n\u2022\nfailure or discontinuation of any of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to future licensing, collaboration, or development agreements;\n\u2022\ndelays in the commercialization of our current or any future drug candidates;\n\u2022\npublic misperception regarding the use of our therapies, or public bias of against \u201canti-aging\u201d companies;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and sales of new products, technologies, or businesses;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and supply issues related to our drug candidates for clinical studies or future drug candidates for commercialization;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our future competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n\u2022\nany major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nnew legislation in the United States relating to the sale or pricing of pharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims or other litigation or public concern about the safety of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that may be unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not develop and may not be maintained.\nPrior to our initial public offering in May 2018, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active trading market for our common stock may never be sustained on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other exchange in the future. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications, or technologies using our shares as consideration.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. In the event any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or\nmisleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical studies and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. For example, on June 3, 2019, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, covering the offering of up to $250.0 million of shares of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, and entered into a sales agreement, or the June 2019 Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $75.0 million, through an at-the-market equity offering program, or Initial ATM Offering Program, under which Cowen acts as our sales agent. On July 31, 2020, we entered into the July 2020 Sales Agreement with Cowen to sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $50.0 million, through an additional at-the-market equity offering program, or our Additional ATM Offering Program, under which Cowen acts as our sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued and sold 5,002,257 shares of our common stock through our Initial ATM Offering Program. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold 1,187,068 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock sold through the Initial ATM Offering Program and 707,459 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock sold through the Additional ATM Offering Program. On September 29, 2021, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, under which we may at our discretion sell up to $30.0 million shares of our common stock, subject to certain daily limits, applicable prices, and conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we issued and sold 4,172,855 shares of our common stock under our Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park amounting to $8.3 million in gross proceeds. In addition, under the Purchase Agreement, we issued 252,447 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any future sales of our common stock to Lincoln Park. Sales of shares of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some or none of the additional shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell under the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares of common stock, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares of common stock at any time or in its discretion. The sale by Lincoln Park of a substantial number of shares of our common stock issued by us to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nIn addition, on December 15, 2021 we entered into an amendment to our Loan and Security Agreement dated August 3, 2020 with Hercules Capital, Inc., under the terms of Hercules (including any of its assignees) has the option for a period of six (6) months to convert up to $5.0 million of the outstanding principal under the existing loan into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we issued 1,727,361 shares of our common stock to Hercules in accordance with this amendment.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other securities by our stockholders, by us under the Shelf Registration Statement, whether pursuant to the ATM Offering Program or otherwise or by Lincoln Park or through the Hercules Amendment or through any other means could also lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity or equity-related securities.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset a portion of future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, if ever. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. As a result, even if we achieve profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chief executive officer or the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. We will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Furthermore, the market for products with the potential to treat diseases of aging, particularly those affecting large populations in a wide range of geographic locations, may be particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions. A global financial crisis or a global or regional political disruption, including\nmost recently as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused and could continue to cause extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our current drug candidates or any future drug candidates, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Weakened or declining economic conditions could be caused by a number of factors. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, other natural disasters or unforeseen pandemics and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters and other facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which in the past has experienced both severe earthquakes and wildfires. Although we carry earthquake insurance, it is limited in scope. Earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Measures taken in response to a pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which causes a public health emergency, could also disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, in mid-March 2020, in alignment with federal, state and local guidance designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, we transitioned to a remote work plan and reduced onsite staffing model for all employees who cannot perform their work from home, such as our laboratory, operations, and facilities staff. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we may be required to take additional actions that could impact our operations if required by applicable laws or regulations or if we determine them to be in the best interests of our employees.\nFurthermore, integral parties in our supply chain are similarly vulnerable to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. As a result of COVID-19, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees that are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nMoreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems, or those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, any future commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse, data privacy laws and other similar non-U.S. laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, the creation of fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical studies, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our product and drug candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and any third-party manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air and water; and employee health and safety. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products.\nAlthough we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, product development and manufacturing efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical studies or regulatory approvals could be suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on drug candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to\nprevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nAccordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal information, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or any service providers\u2019, contractors\u2019 or future collaborators\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon \u201ccovered entities\u201d (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity.\nHIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, violating consumers\u2019 privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.\nIn addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information, in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, recently passed in California as well. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CRO, and contractors must comply. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal information of subjects within the European Economic Area, or EEA, including clinical trial data. Further, applicable privacy laws and court decisions could impact our ability to transfer personal data internationally. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EEA. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or the Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme, and imposed further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, or SCCs. As a result, the Privacy Shield is no longer a valid mechanism for transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States. The SCC restrictions include a requirement for companies to carry out a transfer impact assessment which, among other things, assesses the laws governing access to personal data in the recipient country and considers whether supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs will need to be implemented to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection to that afforded in the EEA. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. The GDPR has and will continue to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as health data, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators.\nIn addition, the GDPR provides for more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, beginning January 1, 2021, we may have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in United Kingdom national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e. fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards.\nHowever, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/ extends that decision.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. We may fail to comply with the rules that apply to public companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and regulations regarding corporate governance practices. The listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, filing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costlier. Any changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, and the related rules of the SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nDuring the course of our review of our internal controls we may identify deficiencies in our internal controls that we must remediate. If we identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, as a public company we will be required to file accurate and timely quarterly and annual reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. In order to report our results of operations and financial statements on an accurate and timely basis, we will depend in part on CROs to provide timely and accurate notice of their costs to us. Any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from The Nasdaq Global Select Market or other adverse consequences that would materially harm to our business.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting\npronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which may allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO, (2) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.", "PERMNO": 17825, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "UBX"}
