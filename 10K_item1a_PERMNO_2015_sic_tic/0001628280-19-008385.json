You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe have a history of operating losses and substantial indebtedness. Future cash flows from operations and financings may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in recent years and, as of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $92.4 million. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue in the future to cover our expenses and achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all.\nWe have issued various promissory notes to finance our acquisitions of KBS and EBGL and to provide for our general working capital needs. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt totaling approximately $11.7 million. Our debt primarily included (i) $3.7 million principal outstanding on KBS\u2019s $4.0 million revolving credit facility under a loan and security agreement (as amended, the \u201cKBS Loan Agreement\u201d) with Gerber Finance Inc. (\u201cGerber Finance\u201d), and $3.0 million principal outstanding under a loan and security agreement with Gerber Finance used to finance the acquisition of EBGL (as amended, the \u201cAcquisition Loan Agreement\u201d), and (ii) $2.8 million principal outstanding on EBGL\u2019s $3.0 million revolving credit facility under a revolving credit loan agreement with Premier Bank (the \u201cPremier Loan Agreement\u201d), which became effective on June 30, 2017 and replaced the prior $3.0 million revolving credit facility under a loan and security agreement with Gerber Finance (the \u201cEBGL Loan Agreement\u201d). We also have debt with related parties which includes (i) $1.4 million of unsecured promissory notes with Lone Star Value Co-Invest I, LLP (\"LSV Co-Invest I\") with interest payable semi-annually at a rate of 10.0% per annum (LSV Co-Invest I may elect to receive interest in-kind at a rate of 12.0% per annum), with any unpaid principal and interest due on January 12, 2020 (\u201cLSVI Co-Invest I Notes Payable\u201d, otherwise referred to herein and defined below as the LSV Co-Invest I January Note and LSV Co-Invest I June Note) (ii) $0.3 million of unsecured promissory notes with Lone Star Value Management, LLC (\"LSVM\"), with interest payable annually at a rate of 10.0% per annum (LSVM may elect to receive any interest payment entirely in-kind at a rate of 12.0% per annum), with any unpaid principal and interest due on November 30, 2020(\"LSVM Note\"), and (iii) a $0.3\nmillion unsecured promissory note with Digirad Corporation (\"Digirad\")(NASDAQ: DRAD), with interest payable at 10.0% per annum for the first 12 months of its term, and at 12.0% per annum for the remaining 12 months, with any unpaid principal and interest due on December 14, 2020.\nThere can be no assurance that our existing cash reserves, together with funds generated by our operations and any future financings, will be sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations, to avoid liquidity issues and/or fund operations beyond this fiscal year. Our inability to generate funds from our operations and/or obtain financing sufficient to satisfy our payment obligations may result in our obligations being accelerated by our lenders, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to avoid liquidity issues and/or fund operations beyond this fiscal year.\nWe may need additional financing and our ability to obtain such financing may be limited.\nWe may need additional financing in order to satisfy our debt payment obligations and effectively execute our business plan, which may include strategic acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing, or that if available, it will be available to us on acceptable terms. Our existing loan agreements with Gerber Finance contain negative covenants limiting our ability to obtain additional debt financing without the consent of Gerber Finance. Due to our history of operating losses, existing debt payment obligations and the restrictions under the Gerber Finance loan agreements, our ability to obtain such additional financing may be limited.\nThe Gerber Finance loan agreements contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nOur loan agreements with Gerber Finance contain certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring us to not incur a net annual post-tax loss for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and a minimum level of net income for each fiscal year thereafter. These covenants also include restrictions on our abilities to take certain actions without the consent of Gerber Finance, and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on the ability of the borrowers to take the following actions: merge, consolidate, acquire or invest in another company; incur additional debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; engage in other businesses; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; and make certain payments, including dividends or distributions to ATRM.\nOur inability to comply with the financial covenants under our loan agreements with Gerber Finance and Premier Bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2018, KBS was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the KBS Loan Agreement requiring no net annual post-tax loss for KBS or the minimum leverage ratio covenant as of these test dates. Additionally, KBS was not in compliance with the requirement to deliver the Company's fiscal year-end financial statements reviewed by an independent certified accounting firm acceptable to Gerber Finance within 105 days from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The occurrence of any event of default under the KBS Loan Agreement may result in KBS\u2019s obligations under the KBS Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. In April 2019, we obtained a waiver from Gerber Finance for these events. In addition, the Company and Gerber Finance agreed to eliminate the minimum leverage ratio covenant for years after 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, EBGL was not in compliance with the following covenants under the Premier Loan Agreement: (i) requirement to maintain a Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the calendar year of at least 1.0; and (ii) a requirement to deliver the Company's fiscal year-end audited financial statements within 120 days of the end of each calendar year. The occurrence of any event of default under the Premier Loan Agreement may result in EBGL\u2019s obligations under the Premier Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. In April 2019, we obtained a waiver from Premier Bank for these events through August 1, 2019 (the current maturity date of the Premier Loan Agreement).\nIf the Company fails to comply with any financial covenants under our loan agreements with Gerber Finance or Premier Bank going forward, the applicable lender(s) may demand the repayment of the credit facilities amount outstanding and any unpaid interest thereon.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team and other key employees.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on our senior management team and other key employees and the ability of other personnel or new hires to effectively replace key employees who may retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team\nand attract and retain new leadership and other important personnel could lead to ineffective management and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the housing industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.\nThe housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal. It is influenced by many national and regional factors, including the availability of financing for home buyers and developers, consumer confidence, interest rates, demographic and employment trends, income levels, housing demand, general economic conditions (including inflation and recessions), and the availability of suitable home sites. As a result of the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results have been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors or other issues that may arise could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nAlthough modular and wall panel construction in our factories eliminates many of the weather-related challenges encountered with site-built construction, our operations can still be impacted by weather and other seasonal factors. Weather can cause delays in site preparation, including delays in building the foundation for a commercial project or residential home, access to building sites and customer delays in setting modular homes or wall panels due to weather conditions and temperature. Additionally, sales demand, especially for residential homes, generally weakens in the winter months, particularly in the northeast and upper midwest regions of the United States. As a result, both KBS and EBGL experience some seasonality. At KBS, the third quarter typically is the strongest demand period and the first quarter typically is the lowest demand period during the year. Although EBGL experiences some seasonality, it is less pronounced than KBS. EBGL\u2019s fluctuations in business are impacted more by the timing of its large wall panel projects. At EBGL, the first quarter typically is the strongest demand period and the third quarter typically is the lowest demand period during the year.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials.\nPrices and availability of raw materials used to manufacture our products can change significantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our products may be limited at times resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Both KBS\u2019s and EBGL\u2019s major material components are dimensional lumber and wood sheet products, which include plywood and oriented strand board. Lumber costs are subject to market fluctuations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials may also be influenced by transportation costs. It is not certain that any price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities. The state of the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials. Our inability to raise the price of our products in response to increases in prices of raw materials or to maintain a proper supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nWe have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2018.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2018 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to inadequate accounting processes and internal control procedures. Our failure to successfully remediate these material weaknesses could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and to produce timely and reliable financial information. Additionally, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our public disclosures, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. For a discussion of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts, please see Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains an emphasis paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nThe audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm covering the December 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph that states that our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency, among other matters, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This going concern opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of new debt or equity securities or otherwise. Future reports on our financial statements may also include an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $92.4 million. Working capital has remained negative over the past several years. Cash used in operating activities, while improved over 2017, remains negative,\nwhich has required us to generate funds from investing and financing activities. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt of approximately $11.7 million. To date, our operating losses have been funded primarily from investing and financing activities.\nWe have had, and we will likely continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our future operations. However, no assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise any such additional capital, we would be required to take actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, and we may not be able to continue operations. Additionally, a failure to generate additional liquidity could negatively impact our access to materials or services that are important to the operation of our business. We also cannot give assurance that we will achieve sufficient revenues in the future to achieve profitability and cash flow positive operations to allow us to continue as a going concern. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause third parties to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a few customers that account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of these customers, or decrease in their demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales and accounts receivable. Two customers, each commercial builders, accounted for approximately 10.4% and 10.8%, respectively, of our total net sales in 2018. A reduction, delay, or cancellation of orders from one or more of these significant customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, would likely have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf KBS is unable to maintain or establish its relationships with independent dealers and contractors who sell its homes, KBS revenue could decline.\nKBS sells residential homes through a network of independent dealers and contractors. As is common in the modular home industry, KBS\u2019s independent dealers may also sell homes produced by competing manufacturers and can cancel their relationships with KBS on short notice. In addition, these dealers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced by KBS. If KBS is not able to maintain good relationships with its dealers and contractors or establish relationships with new solvent dealers or contractors, KBS\u2019s revenue could decline.\nDue to the nature of our business, many of our expenses are fixed costs and if there are decreases in demand for our products, it may adversely affect our operating results.\nMany of our expenses, particularly those relating to properties, capital equipment, and certain manufacturing overhead items, are fixed in the short term. Reduced demand for our products causes our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which adversely affects our gross margins and profitability.\nCertain actions taken in connection with reducing operating costs may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn the event of a housing downturn and a decline in our revenues, we may implement cost reduction actions such as temporary factory shutdowns, workforce reductions, pay freezes and reductions, and reductions in other expenditures. In doing so, we will attempt to maintain the necessary infrastructures to allow us to take full advantage of subsequent improvements in market conditions. However, there can be no assurance that reductions we may make in personnel and expenditure levels and the loss of the capabilities of personnel we have terminated or may terminate will not inhibit us in the timely ramp up of production in response to improving market conditions.\nDue to the nature of the work we perform, we may be subject to significant liability claims and disputes.\nWe engage in services that can result in substantial injury or damages that may expose us to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. For example, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury and wrongful death claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes, as well as other claims. An unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages. Although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management, safety, and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, there can be no assurance that such programs will protect us fully from all risks and liabilities. If we sustain liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale and pricing of some of our products; transportation; logistics; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations.\nIn fiscal 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\"), which significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. During fiscal 2018, additional guidance related to the TCJA was issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the TCJA, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the TCJA will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. Further, uncertainties also exist in terms of how U.S. states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these U.S. federal income tax changes, which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol \u201cATRM.\u201d Trading of securities on this quotation service is generally limited and is effected on a less regular basis than on exchanges such as NASDAQ. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the fiscal year 2018 was approximately 900 shares per day. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of securities could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their securities without depressing the market price for such securities.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. income tax purposes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $104.7 million and state NOLs of approximately $23.3 million. Significant changes that impact the Company in the TCJA include a limitation on the utilization of NOLs arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. The TCJA also reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21%, from a prior rate of 35%, which may cause a reduction in the economic benefit of our NOLs and other deferred tax assets available to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Further, our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods and whether we become subject to annual limitations on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by our NOLs.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by a corporation\u2019s NOLs if the corporation experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when the corporation\u2019s \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the corporation by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation include provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of our NOLs by generally restricting any direct or indirect transfers of our common stock that increase the direct or indirect ownership of our common stock by any person from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more, or increase the percentage of our common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of our common stock. Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of these transfer restrictions will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee. These restrictions were scheduled to expire on December 5, 2017, however, at the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders\nheld on December 4, 2017, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to extend this provision to December 5, 2020. On December 4, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Amendment with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota of effect this, as well as other, amendments.\nAlthough this measure is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, we cannot assure you that it will prevent all transfers of our common stock that could result in such an ownership change. Further, this measure could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, ATRM or a large block of our common stock, which may adversely affect the marketability, and depress the market price, of our common stock. In addition, this measure could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our shareholders.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership may limit individual stockholder ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of June 14, 2019, Jeffrey E. Eberwein, the Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), owned approximately 17% of the outstanding common stock of ATRM. Mr. Eberwein also is the Chairman of the Board of Digirad Corporation (\"Digirad\") and beneficially owns 869,152 shares of Digirad's common stock, or approximately 4.3% of the shares outstanding. Mr. Eberwein is also the Chief Executive Officer of LSVM, which is the investment manager of Lone Star Value Investors, LP (\"LSVI\") and LSV Co-Invest. LSVI owns 222,577 shares of the Company\u2019s 10.0% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock (\"Series B Stock\") and another 374,562 shares of Series B Stock are owned directly by LSV Co-Invest I. Through these relationships and other relationships with affiliated entities, Mr. Eberwein may be deemed the beneficial owner of the securities owned by LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I. Mr. Eberwein disclaims beneficial ownership of Series B Stock, except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.\nIn addition to stock, LSV Co-Invest I also holds unsecured promissory notes of the Company with the principal amount totaling $1.4 million, LSVM holds an unsecured note with a principal amount totaling $0.3 million; and LSVI has pledged up to $3.0 million plus additional fees as collateral for a long term debt.", "PERMNO": 79472, "SIC": 1520, "TIC": "ATRM"}
