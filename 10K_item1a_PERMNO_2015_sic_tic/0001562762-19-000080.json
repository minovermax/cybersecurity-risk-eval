RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nOur loan portfolio consists of a high percentage of loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family real estate. These loans are riskier than loans secured by one- to four-family properties.\nAt December 31, 2018, $1.698 billion, or 73.74%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and multi-family real estate loans. We intend to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans. These loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation and income stream of the collateral that is pledged. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan.\n\ufeff\nCommercial loans and commercial real estate loans generally carry larger balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. As a result, banking regulators continue to give greater scrutiny to lenders with a high concentration of commercial real estate loans in their portfolios, such as us, and such lenders are expected to implement stricter underwriting standards, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress testing, as well as higher capital levels and loss allowances. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. If we cannot effectively manage the risk associated with our high concentration of commercial real estate loans, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain and manage our growth.\nThe Company has progressed on an organic branching initiative which is intended to mitigate the risk of our strong Hudson County concentration, to develop our branch infrastructure in a manner more consistent with the expansion of lending markets and to fill in and grow our branch footprint in a more uniform and coherent fashion, which previously had grown predominately through merger and acquisition activity. To this end, the Company opened seven branches in 2016 and one in February, 2019. The Company is planning on opening three branches within the next year.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loans balances, which may adversely impact our efficiency ratio, earnings and stockholder returns.\n\ufeff\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. We may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not cover losses in our loan portfolio at the date of the financial statements. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income. At December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses totaled $22.4 million, representing 0.97% of total loans or 258.69% of non-performing loans.\nWhile we have only been operating for 18 years, we have experienced significant growth in our loan portfolio, particularly our loans secured by commercial real estate. Although we believe we have underwriting standards to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult to assess the future performance of our loan portfolio due to the relatively recent origination of many of these loans. We can give you no assurance that our non-performing loans will not increase or that our non-performing or delinquent loans will not adversely affect our future performance.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe asset quality of our loan portfolio may deteriorate if the economy falters, resulting in a portion of our loans failing to perform in accordance with their terms. Under such circumstances our profitability will be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $26.2 million in classified loans of which none were classified as doubtful and none were classified as loss. We also had $13.2 million of loans that were classified as special mention. In addition, at that date we had $7.2 million in non-accruing loans, or 0.31% of total loans. We have adhered to stringent underwriting standards in the origination of our loans, but there can be no assurance that loans that we originated will not experience asset quality deterioration as a result of a downturn in the local economy. Should our local or regional economy weaken, our asset quality may deteriorate resulting in losses to the Company.\nAdverse events in New Jersey, where our business is generally concentrated, could adversely affect our results and future growth.\nOur business, the location of our branches and the real estate collateralizing our real estate loans are generally concentrated in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area. As a result, we are exposed to geographic risks. The occurrence of an economic downturn in New Jersey or the New York metropolitan area, or adverse changes in laws or regulations in New Jersey or the New York metropolitan area, could impact the credit quality of our assets, the business of our customers and our ability to expand our business.\nOur success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing in our market area. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally, regionally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may be negatively affected. In addition, the economies of the communities in which we operate are substantially dependent on the growth of the economy in the State of New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area. To the extent that economic conditions in New Jersey are unfavorable or do not continue to grow as projected, the economy in our market area would be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our market area if they do occur.\nIn addition, the market value of the real estate securing loans as collateral could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 95% of our total loans were secured by real estate. Adverse developments affecting commerce or real estate values in the local economies in our primary market areas could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. In addition, a significant percentage of our loans are to individuals and businesses in New Jersey. Our business customers may not have customer bases that are as diverse as businesses serving regional or national markets. Consequently, any decline in the economy of our market area could have an adverse impact on our revenues and financial condition. In particular, we may experience increased loan delinquencies, which could result in a higher provision for loan losses and increased charge-offs. Any sustained period of increased non-payment, delinquencies, foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in our market area could adversely affect the value of our assets, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend primarily on net interest income for our earnings rather than fee income.\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our operating income. We have less reliance on traditional sources of fee income utilized by some community banks, such as fees from sales of insurance, securities or investment advisory products or services. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our net interest income was $77.7 million and $61.9 million, respectively. The amount of our net interest income is influenced by the overall interest rate environment, competition, and the amount of our interest-earning assets relative to the amount of our interest-bearing liabilities. In the event that one or more of these factors were to result in a decrease in our net interest income, we do not have significant sources of fee income to make up for decreases in net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates could hurt our profits.\nOur profitability, like most financial institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, our results of operations depend largely on movements in market interest rates and our ability to manage our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in response to these movements. Factors such as inflation, recession and instability in financial markets, among other factors beyond our control, may affect interest rates.\nIf interest rates continue to rise, and if rates on our deposits and variable rate borrowings reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long-term loans and investments, we could experience compression of our interest rate spread, which would have a negative effect on our profitability. Conversely, decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk, as we may have to redeploy such loan or securities proceeds into lower-yielding assets, which might also negatively impact our income.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates limits our ability to lower our interest expense, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease as our loans reprice or are originated at these low market rates. Accordingly, our net interest income may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. Also, our interest rate risk-modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results.\n\ufeff\nWhile we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, changes in interest rates can still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cItem 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThe building of market share through de novo branching and expansion of our commercial real estate and multi-family lending capacity could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nWe intend to continue to build market share through de novo branching and expansion of our commercial real estate and multi-family lending capacity. Since January 1, 2015, we have opened nine de novo branches. Pursuant to our de novo branch expansion strategy, during the three years ended December 31, 2018 we hired 25 new full-time equivalent employees, primarily in the areas of business development, loan administration and customer service. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches and expansion of lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in the opening of a new branch. Finally, our business expansion may not be successful after establishment of new branches.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOn April 17, 2018, we completed our merger with IA Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary Indus-American Bank headquartered in Edison, New Jersey. We intend to continue pursuing a strategy that includes acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nfinding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u00b7\nattracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u00b7\nretaining customers and key personnel;\n\u00b7\nobtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nconducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties;\n\u00b7\nintegrating acquired businesses; and\n\u00b7\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital.\n\ufeff\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit our strategy and standards. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized. Acquisitions will be subject to regulatory approvals, and we may be unable to obtain such approvals. Acquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties. Acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire and to realize our attempts to eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that they would otherwise be able to direct toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market trading values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition of a financial institution or service company, and the carrying amount of any goodwill that we acquire may be subject to impairment in future periods. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted a final rule implementing the regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel III\u201d) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule includes minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios.\n\ufeff\nThe minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The Bank has elected to opt out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings for calculating its regulatory capital requirements. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and, now fully phased in, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\n\ufeff\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, the FDIC proposed a rule that establishes a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at 9% for institutions under $10 billion in assets that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized. The FDIC\u2019s proposed rule provides that the Bank will be well capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 9% or greater, adequately capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5% or greater, undercapitalized if the Bank\u2019s community bank leverage ratio is less than 7.5% and greater than 6% and significantly undercapitalized if the Bank\u2019s community bank leverage ratio is less than 6%. The definition of critically undercapitalized is unchanged from the current regulations. Until the FDIC\u2019s proposed rule is finalized, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect.\n\ufeff\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements likely will result in lower returns on equity and could require raising additional capital in the future or result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThere have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber-attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less-regulated and remote areas of the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including through online and mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank\u2019s reliance on brokered deposits could adversely affect its liquidity and operating results.\nAmong other sources of funds, we rely on brokered deposits to provide funds with which to make loans and provide for other liquidity needs. On December 31, 2018, brokered deposits totaled $248.0 million, or approximately 11.37% of total deposits. The Bank\u2019s primary source for brokered deposits is CDARS. Of the $248.0 million in brokered deposits, $72.8 million are reciprocal and are not considered brokered deposits under recent regulatory reform.\nGenerally, brokered deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits. In the future, those depositors may not replace their brokered deposits with us as they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to keep those deposits or to replace them with other deposits or other sources of funds. Not being able to maintain or replace those deposits as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher deposit rates to maintain or replace brokered deposits would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition is intense within the banking and financial services industry in New Jersey and New York. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources, higher lending limits and offer services that we do not or cannot provide. This competition makes it more difficult for us to originate new loans and retain and attract new deposits. Price competition for loans may result in originating fewer loans or earning less on our loans. Price competition for deposits may result in a reduction of our deposit base or paying more on our deposits.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and we may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike other bank holding companies and financial institutions, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. Under these laws, we are required, among other things, to enforce a customer identification program and file currency transaction and suspicious activity reports with the federal government. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws or make required reports. Because we operate our business in the highly urbanized greater Newark/New York City metropolitan area, we may be at greater risk of scrutiny by government regulators for compliance with these laws.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthening our internal controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations.\n\ufeff\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-owner occupied, non-farm, non-residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. Based on these factors, we have a concentration in loans of the type described in (ii), above, or 451.7% of our total capital at December 31, 2018. The purpose of the guidance is to assist banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. Our bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us or that may result in a curtailment of our commercial real estate and multi-family lending and/or the requirement that we maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, either of which would adversely affect our loan originations and profitability.\n\ufeff\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. We are a holding company that conducts substantially all of our operations through the Bank. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock will depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the Bank.\n\ufeff\nUnder New Jersey banking law, the Bank may pay a dividend to the Company provided that following the payment of the dividend the capital stock of the Bank will be unimpaired and the Bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or if not, the payment of such dividend will not reduce the surplus of the Bank.\n\ufeff\nUnder New Jersey law, the Company may not make a distribution, if, after giving effect to the distribution, it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or if its total assets would be less than its liabilities.\n\ufeff\nOur current intention is to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share. However, any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will substantially depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, regulatory and state law restrictions, general economic conditions and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our stockholders.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 91015, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BCBP"}
