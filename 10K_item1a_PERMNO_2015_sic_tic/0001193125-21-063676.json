{"cik": "814585", "company": "MBIA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nReferences in the risk factors to the \u201cCompany\u201d are to MBIA Inc., together with its domestic and international subsidiaries. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d are to MBIA Inc. or the Company, as the context requires. Our risk factors are grouped into categories and are presented in the following order: \u201cInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cLegal, Regulatory and Other Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\u201d, and \u201cGeneral Risk Factors\u201d. Risk Factors are generally listed in order of significance within each category.\nInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\nSome of the state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities and other providers of public services, located in the U.S. or abroad, that issued public finance obligations we insured are experiencing fiscal stress that could result in increased credit losses or impairments on those obligations.\nCertain issuers are reporting fiscal stress that has resulted in a significant increase in taxes and/or a reduction in spending or other measures in efforts to satisfy their financial obligations. In particular, certain jurisdictions have significantly underfunded pension liabilities which are placing additional stress on their finances and are particularly challenging to restructure either through negotiation or under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, or increase other revenues, cut spending, reduce liabilities, and/or receive state or federal assistance, we may experience losses or impairments on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial stress experienced by certain municipal issuers could result in the filing of Chapter 9 proceedings in states where municipal issuers are permitted to seek bankruptcy protection. In these proceedings, which remain rare, the resolution of bondholder claims (and by extension, those of bond insurers) may be subject to legal challenge by other creditors.\nIn particular, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and several of its public corporations and instrumentalities, which have reported significant fiscal stress, are currently in bankruptcy-like proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (\u201cPROMESA\u201d).\nThe extent and duration of any aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies that may be offered to Puerto Rico is uncertain. Further, greater involvement of the federal government through its action to deliver disaster relief and support services to Puerto Rico heightens the political risk already inherent in the legacy debt restructuring. This risk could lead the independent oversight board created by PROMESA to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s debt restructuring (the \u201cOversight Board\u201d), Puerto Rico itself, or the federal government to seek to extract greater concessions from creditors based on the uncertainty of Puerto Rico\u2019s long term recovery prospects. In this event, losses at National on select Puerto Rico exposures could increase materially.\nAs of December 31, 2020, National had $2.9 billion of debt service outstanding related to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico may be unable or unwilling to pay their obligations as and when due, in which case National would be required to pay claims of unpaid principal and interest when due under its insurance policies, which could be material. On January 1, 2021, Puerto Rico defaulted on scheduled debt service for certain National insured bonds and as a result, National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $51 million. While National will seek to recover any claim payments it makes under its guarantees, there is no assurance that it will be able to recover such\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\npayments. To the extent that its claims payments are ultimately substantially greater than its claims recoveries, National would experience losses on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 22, 2021, National agreed to join a revised Plan Support Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2021 (the \u201c2021 PSA\u201d), among the Oversight Board, certain holders of GO Bonds and PBA Bonds, Assured Guaranty Corp. and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp, and Syncora Guarantee Inc. in connection with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority Title III cases. The 2021 PSA provides that, among other things, National shall receive a pro rata share of allocable cash, newly issued General Obligation bonds, a contingent value instrument and certain fees. National has the right to unilaterally terminate its participation in the 2021 PSA on or prior to March 31, 2021, and there can be no assurance that National will not exercise such termination right. Further, while the 2021 PSA contemplates a plan becoming effective on or before December 15, 2021, there can be no assurance that such a plan will ever become effective, or on the contemplated timeline. In the event that National does not terminate its participation in the 2021 PSA on or prior to March 31, 2021, the Oversight Board and National shall jointly request the entry of an order in the Title III court staying National\u2019s actions to lift the automatic stay in the GO and HTA Title III cases and to appoint a trustee in the HTA Title III case pursuant to Section 926, both currently before the First Circuit Court of Appeals, together with other actions related to the clawback of HTA funds from the Commonwealth, and National shall take no further action with respect to those proceedings subject to the Commonwealth plan becoming effective.\nOn May 3, 2019, PREPA, the Oversight Board, the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (\u201cAAFAF\u201d), the Ad Hoc Group of PREPA bondholders (the \u201cAd Hoc Group\u201d), and Assured Guaranty Corp. and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. entered into a Definitive Restructuring Support Agreement which was amended on September 9, 2019 to include National and Syncora Guarantee, Inc. as supporting parties (as amended, the \u201cRSA\u201d). The Rule 9019 hearing to approve the RSA has been delayed several times, and most recently was adjourned due to the coronavirus crisis until further notice. The debt restructuring contemplated by the RSA will not be effective until (i) confirmation of a plan of adjustment under PROMESA, (ii) negotiation and consummation of definitive documentation and legal opinions, (iii) enactment and implementation of supportive Puerto Rico legislation and (iv) receipt of Puerto Rico regulatory approval, each of which outcome is uncertain and subject to varying degrees of risk. In addition, the restructuring the RSA contemplates has received criticism from various parties including members of the Puerto Rico government and other stakeholders. This opposition could adversely affect the ability of the Oversight Board and RSA Parties to obtain the Rule 9019 Order and approve the RSA.\nRefer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures.\nLoss reserve estimates and credit impairments are subject to additional uncertainties and loss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential claims.\nOur insurance companies issued financial guarantee policies that insure the financial performance of the obligations guaranteed over a long period of time which are unconditional and irrevocable. Under substantially all of our policies, we do not have a right to cancel the policy. We do not use actuarial approaches that are customarily used by other types of insurance companies to determine our loss reserves. The establishment of the appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving numerous assumptions, estimates and subjective judgments by management, and therefore, there can be no assurance that future net claims in our insured portfolio will not exceed our loss reserves. If our loss reserves are not adequate to cover actual losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We use financial models to project future net claims on our insured portfolio, including insured derivatives, and to establish loss reserves and estimate impairments and related recoveries. There can be no assurance that the future loss projection and impairments based on these models will ultimately reflect the actual losses and impairment and recovery that we experience. Additionally, small changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates could significantly impact loss expectations. For example, our loss reserves are discounted to a net present value reflecting our general obligation to pay claims over time and not on an accelerated basis. Risk-free rates are used to discount our loss reserves under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and the yield-to-maturity of each insurer\u2019s investment fixed-income portfolio (excluding cash and cash equivalents and other investments\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nnot intended to defease long-term liabilities) as of year-end is used to discount each insurer\u2019s loss reserves under statutory accounting principles. Accordingly, changes in the risk-free rates or the yield in our insurance companies\u2019 fixed-income investment portfolios may materially impact loss reserves.\nPolitical and economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a financial guarantee company, our insured exposures and our results of operations can be materially affected by general political and economic conditions, both in the U.S. and around the world. General global unrest, including fraud, terrorism, catastrophic events, natural disasters, pandemics or similar events could disrupt the economy in the U.S. and other countries where we have insured exposure or operate our businesses. As a result of the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic in early 2020, we continue to monitor the impact on our portfolios closely. See Risk Factor \u201cThe pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and other aspects of our business\u201d under \u201cLegal, Regulatory and Other Risk Factors\u201d for additional information on COVID-19. In certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., we face higher risks of governmental intervention through nationalization or expropriation of assets, changes in regulation, an inability to enforce our rights in court or otherwise and corruption, which may cause us to incur losses on the exposures we insure or reputational harm.\nBudget deficits at all levels of government in the U.S., recessions, increases in corporate, municipal, sovereign, sub-sovereign or consumer default rates and other general economic conditions may adversely impact the performance of our insured portfolios and the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. In addition, we are exposed to correlation risk as a result of the possibility that multiple credits will experience losses as a result of any such event or series of events, in particular exposures that are backed by revenues from business and personal travel, such as aircraft securitizations and bonds backed by hotel taxes.\nFinancial modeling involves uncertainty over ultimate outcomes, which makes it difficult to estimate liquidity, potential claims payments, loss reserves and fair values.\nThe Company uses third-party and internal financial models to estimate liquidity, potential claims payments, loss reserves and fair values. We use internal financial models to conduct liquidity stress-scenario testing to ensure that we maintain cash and liquid securities sufficient to meet our payment requirements. These measurements are performed on a legal entity and operating segment basis. We also rely on financial models, generated internally and supplemented by models generated by third parties, to estimate factors relating to the highly complex securities we insure, including future credit performance of the underlying assets, and to evaluate structures, rights and our potential obligations over time. We also use internal models for ongoing insurance portfolio monitoring and to estimate case basis loss reserves and, where applicable, to report our obligations under our contracts at fair value. We may supplement such models with third-party models or use third-party experts to consult with our internal modeling specialists. Both internal and external models are subject to model risk and information risk, and there can be no assurance that the inputs into the models received from third parties will be accurate or that the models themselves are accurate or comprehensive in estimating our liquidity, potential future paid claims, related loss reserves and fair values or that they are similar to methodologies employed by our competitors, counterparties or other market participants. Estimates of our claims payments, in particular, may materially impact our liquidity position. We may make changes to our estimated claims payments, loss reserves or fair value models from time to time. These changes could materially impact our financial results.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not adequately detect or prevent future losses.\nWe assess our risk management policies and procedures on a periodic basis. As a result of such assessment, we may take steps to change our internal risk assessment capabilities and procedures, portfolio management policies, systems and processes and our policies and procedures for monitoring and assessing the performance of our insured portfolio in changing market conditions. There can be no assurance, however, that these steps will be adequate to avoid future losses. In some cases, losses can be substantial, particularly if a loss occurs on a transaction in which we have a large notional exposure or on a transaction structured with large, bullet-type maturities.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nLegal, Regulatory and Other Risk Factors\nRegulatory change could adversely affect our businesses, and regulations limit investors\u2019 ability to affect a takeover or business combination that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nThe financial guarantee insurance industry has historically been and will continue to be subject to the direct and indirect effects of governmental regulation, including insurance laws, securities laws, tax laws, legal precedents and accounting rules affecting asset-backed and municipal obligations, as well as changes in those laws. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could expose our insurance companies and/or their constituents, to fines, the loss of their insurance licenses, and the inability to engage in certain business activity, as the case may be. These laws also limit investors\u2019 ability to affect a takeover or business combination without the approval of our insurance regulators.\nChanges to laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof could subject our insurance companies to increased loss reserves and capital requirements or more stringent regulation generally, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, changes to accounting standards and regulations may require modifications to our accounting methodology, both prospectively and for prior periods; such changes could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results and/or make it more difficult for investors to understand the economics of our business and may thus influence the types or volume of business that we may choose to pursue.\nOur insurance companies could become subject to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions that require them to maintain qualifying investments to support their reserves and required minimum surplus. Furthermore, our insurance companies may be restricted from making commutation or other payments if doing so would cause them to fail to meet such requirements, and the New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYSDFS\u201d) may impose other remedial actions on us as described further below to the extent our insurance companies do not meet such requirements.\nUnder New York Insurance Law (\u201cNYIL\u201d), the Superintendent of Financial Services (the \u201cSuperintendent\u201d) may apply for an order directing the rehabilitation or liquidation of a domestic insurance company under certain circumstances, including upon the insolvency of the company, if the company has willfully violated its charter or the NYIL, or if the company is found, after examination, to be in such condition that further transaction of business would be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors or the public. The Superintendent may also suspend an insurer\u2019s license, restrict its license authority, or limit the amount of premiums written in New York if, after a hearing, the Superintendent determines that the insurer\u2019s surplus to policyholders is not adequate in relation to its outstanding liabilities or financial needs. If the Superintendent were to take any such action as to National, it could result in the reduction or elimination of the payment of dividends to MBIA Inc.\nIn addition to the Superintendent\u2019s authority to commence a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, if the Superintendent finds that the liabilities of MBIA Insurance Corporation exceed its admitted assets, the Superintendent could use its authority under Section 1310 of the NYIL to order MBIA Insurance Corporation to cease making claims payments (a \u201c1310 Order\u201d). Continuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries as well as certain other factors may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s liquidity and its ability to timely meet its insurance obligations, and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, or issue a 1310 Order, if it does not believe MBIA Insurance Corporation will be able to pay expected claims. See Risk Factor \u201cAn MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences\u201d under \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\u201d for the potential impacts of an MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, or a 1310 Order.\nPrivate litigation claims could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs further set forth in \u201cNote 19: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company and/or its subsidiaries\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nare named as defendants in certain litigations, and in the ordinary course of business, may be a defendant in or party to a new or threatened legal action. Although the Company intends to vigorously defend against any current or future action, there can be no assurance that it will prevail in any such action, and any adverse ultimate outcome could result in a loss and/or have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAn ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could have materially adverse tax consequences.\nIn connection with transactions in our shares from time to time, we may in the future experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (generally three years). If an ownership change were to occur, our ability to use certain tax attributes, including certain losses, credits, deductions or tax basis, may be limited. On May 2, 2018, MBIA Inc.\u2019s shareholders ratified an amendment to the Company\u2019s By-Laws, which had been adopted earlier by MBIA Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors. The amendment places restrictions on certain acquisitions of Company stock that otherwise may have increased the likelihood of an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. The amendment generally prohibits a person from becoming a \u201cSection 382 five-percent shareholder\u201d by acquiring, directly or by attribution, 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and will generally restrict existing \u201cSection 382 five-percent shareholders\u201d from increasing their ownership interest under Section 382 by more than one percentage point over their percentage stock ownership immediately prior to the effective date of the amendment or, if lower, their percentage thereafter. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that MBIA Inc. will not undergo an ownership change at a time when these limitations could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could materially adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset.\nMBIA Inc. carries a net deferred tax asset whose value is calculated by application of the federal corporate taxation rates in effect at the time of determination. Changes in applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our net deferred tax asset. As a result of the Company having established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset in 2017, any adjustment to the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset, will likely result in a corresponding change to the Company\u2019s valuation allowance, resulting in no impact to the Company\u2019s balance sheet or income statement.\nIneffective internal controls, including internal control over financial reporting, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe cannot be certain that we will not identify control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate a material weakness or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, failure to remediate a material weakness or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation, and could impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nThe pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and other aspects of our business.\nThe global outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), a respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020 and continues to cause significant global economic turmoil and affect a wide range of economic activities, as well as domestic and global business and financial markets. We continue to closely monitor developments related to the pandemic,\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nincluding the timing and impact of the distribution of vaccines, to assess its impact on our employees, insured portfolios and business. There is no assurance that global and domestic economic conditions will not continue to worsen. It remains challenging to comprehensively quantify, or account for the impact of the outbreak on most of the credits within our insured portfolios, investment portfolios, or general business operations. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain, including but not limited to the severity of the pandemic, and the effectiveness of financial and regulatory actions taken at the state and federal levels to contain or address its impact. While governmental and non-governmental organizations are engaging in efforts to combat the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues, the effectiveness of such measures cannot be assured. We also cannot predict how political, legal and regulatory responses to the pandemic, such as the nature of and conditions to aid states or municipalities, tax policy, or programs designed to assist impacted individuals, will impact our business.\nAdverse developments on macroeconomic factors resulting from the spread of COVID-19, including without limitation reduced economic activity and certainty, increased unemployment, increased loan defaults or delinquencies, and increased stress on municipal budgets, including due to reduced tax revenues and the inability to raise taxes or limit spending, could materially and adversely affect the performance of our insured portfolio and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, such adverse effects could impact whether the individual municipal or structured finance credits we insure will be able to continue to meet their debt service obligations or avoid long term impairment, and could therefore result in an increase in defaults and on the amount of claims we will be obligated to pay on the related insurance policies. Such increases could cause us to revise our loss projections or other guidance we have previously provided. In particular, certain insured municipal credits, including those relating to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, could come under stress depending in part on the nature of the taxes, fees and revenues pledged to debt repayment and their sensitivity to the related slowdown in economic activity. Further, those structured finance policies in which the underlying principal obligations are comprised of residential or commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, could be negatively affected by delays or failures of borrowers to make payments of principal and interest when due, or delays or moratoriums on foreclosures or enforcement actions with respect to delinquent or defaulted mortgages imposed by governmental authorities. These transactions are also subject to servicer risks, which relate to problems with the transaction\u2019s servicer that could adversely impact performance of the underlying assets. Additionally, several of our credits, particularly within our international public finance sector, feature large, near term debt-service payments, and there can be no assurance that the liquidity position of MBIA Insurance Corporation will enable it to satisfy any claims that arise if the issuers of such credits are unable or unwilling to refinance or repay their obligations. Further, any national recession that may result from the pandemic and its aftermath could present additional but yet unknown credit risks to all of our insured portfolios.\nAdditionally, our liquidity position and our investment portfolios (and, specifically, the valuations of investment assets we hold) have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected as a result of market developments from the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding its outcome. Changes in interest rates, reduced market liquidity or a continued slowdown in U.S. or global economic conditions may also adversely affect the values and cash flows of these assets or the investment portfolio yield and income. Further, extreme market volatility may impact our ability to efficiently and effectively react to market events. Market dislocations, decreases in observable market activity or unavailability of information, in each case, arising from the spread of COVID-19, may restrict our access to key inputs used to derive certain estimates and assumptions made in connection with estimating the values of financial instruments within our financial reporting or otherwise, including estimates and changes in long term macro-economic assumptions relating to our estimate of current expected credit losses on our financial assets. Restricted access to such inputs may make our financial statement balances and estimates and assumptions used to run our business subject to greater variability and subjectivity.\nFurther, while we have implemented operational risk management and business continuity plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions that address the pandemic, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent a material impact on our business operations. Currently, our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could introduce operational risks including but not limited to cybersecurity risk, and impair our ability to manage our business. We also outsource certain business activities to third parties, and thus rely upon the successful implementation and execution of those third parties\u2019 business continuity plans as well. If one or more of the third parties to whom we outsource certain business\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nactivities experience operational failures as a result of the impacts from the spread of COVID-19, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\nWe are a holding company and rely to a significant degree on cash flow from National. A disruption in this cash flow or an inability to access third-party capital could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and ultimately adversely affect liquidity.\nAs a holding company, MBIA Inc. is largely dependent on dividends from National to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and operating expenses, among other items. We expect that for the foreseeable future, National alone will be the source of dividends to the Company, and it is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies generally, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that it may pay. See \u201cNew York State Dividend Limitations\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 and \u201cNote 14: Insurance Regulations and Dividends\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of dividends.\nWe may also from time to time seek to raise capital from external sources. The Company\u2019s access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of such financing would be influenced by various factors, which could include (i) the long-term debt ratings of the Company, (ii) expected dividends from National, (iii) the financial condition and business prospects of our insurance companies and (iv) the perceptions of the financial strength of MBIA Inc. and our insurance companies. There can be no assurance that an inability to obtain adequate capital on favorable terms, or at all, would not adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nConsequently, our inability to maintain access to capital on favorable terms could have an adverse impact on our ability to pay losses and debt obligations, to pay dividends on our capital stock, to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, to pay our operating expenses and to make capital investments in our subsidiaries. In addition, future capital raises for equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Also, some securities that the Company could issue, such as preferred stock or securities issued by the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of its common shares.\nMBIA Inc. has substantial indebtedness, and may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and/or our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and/or satisfy our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, MBIA Inc. had $710 million of medium-term note liabilities, $312 million of Senior Notes liabilities and $269 million of investment agreement liabilities. Our substantial indebtedness and other liabilities could have material consequences because:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain additional financing, should such a need arise, which may limit our ability to satisfy obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\na large portion of MBIA Inc.\u2019s financial resources must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to use for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance debt may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions could be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of our liabilities are at variable rates of interest or denominated in foreign currencies.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nAdverse developments in the credit markets may materially and adversely affect MBIA Inc.\u2019s ability to post collateral and meet other liquidity needs.\nCurrently, a significant portion of the cash and securities of MBIA Inc. are pledged against investment agreement liabilities, intercompany financing arrangements and derivatives, which limit its ability to raise liquidity through asset sales. If the market value or rating eligibility of the assets which are pledged against MBIA Inc.\u2019s obligations were to decline, we would be required to pledge additional eligible assets in order to meet minimum required collateral amounts against these liabilities. In such an event, we may sell assets, potentially with substantial losses, finance unencumbered assets through intercompany facilities, or use free cash or other assets, although there can be no assurance that these strategies will be available or adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\nThe level of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and the discontinuance of certain interbank offered rates, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of our investment portfolios and, therefore, our financial condition. In the event that investments must be sold in order to make payments on insured exposures or other liabilities, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Increases in interest rates also adversely affect the values of investments collateralizing our investment agreement liabilities in our corporate operations, which would require the Company to post additional collateral to its counterparties. In the insurance operations, with respect to credit risk, increasing interest rates could lead to increased stress on transactions in our insured portfolio with floating rate liabilities. Increasing interest rates could also result in a lower present value of salvage reserves while declining interest rates could result in a higher present value of future loss payments.\nLower interest rates can result in lower net interest income since a substantial amount of assets are now held in cash and cash equivalents given the increased focus on liquidity. Lower interest rates would also adversely impact the value of our interest rate swap contracts in our corporate operations, and would require the Company to post additional collateral to its counterparties.\nFurther, a number of our debt issuances, interest rate swap contracts and financial investments are indexed to an interbank offered rate, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and the assets or liabilities related to insured credit transactions may be indexed to LIBOR, as the applicable reference rate. In July 2017, The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021, it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. Subsequently, on November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR, announced plans to cease publication (i) immediately after December 31, 2021 of one week and two month USD LIBOR settings and (ii) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023 of the remaining USD LIBOR settings i.e., overnight and one, three, six and twelve month settings. These announcements, among other developments, have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR, and the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR as a benchmark rate may adversely affect the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of LIBOR which could have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics that could also produce an adverse economic impact.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk in respect of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In addition to insured liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, some of the remaining liabilities in our corporate segment are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and the assets of our corporate segment are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could substantially increase our potential obligations and statutory capital exposure. Conversely, the Company makes investments denominated in a foreign currency and the weakening of the foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar will diminish the value of such non-U.S. dollar denominated asset. Exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in recent periods and may continue to do so in the future, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\nAs described further and for the reasons stated herein, we believe that MBIA Corp. will not provide significant economic or shareholder value to MBIA Inc. For additional information on MBIA Corp., refer to \u201cResults of\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nOperations-International and Structured Finance Insurance\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, also as described further herein, given the separation of MBIA Inc. and MBIA Corp. as distinct legal entities, the absence of any cross defaults between the entities, and the lack of reliance by MBIA Inc. on MBIA Corp. for the receipt of dividends, we do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation by the NYSDFS would have any material economic impact on the financial condition or liquidity of MBIA Inc. However, there can be no assurance that the financial condition or a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation would not have an adverse impact on MBIA Inc. The risk factors described below with respect to MBIA Corp. are set forth for that reason, as well as for an independent understanding of the risks to MBIA Corp.\nContinuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries on insured transactions may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s statutory capital and its ability to meet liquidity needs and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding if the NYSDFS concludes that MBIA Insurance Corporation will not be able to pay expected claims.\nMBIA Insurance Corporation is particularly sensitive to the risk that it will not have sufficient capital or liquid resources to meet contractual payment obligations when due or to make settlement payments in order to terminate insured exposures to avoid losses. While management\u2019s expected liquidity and capital forecasts for MBIA Insurance Corporation reflect adequate resources to pay expected claims, there are risks to the capital and liquidity forecasts as MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s remaining insured exposures and its expected salvage recoveries are potentially volatile. Such volatility exists in the amount of excess spread, and other salvage that MBIA Insurance Corporation may collect, including in particular recoveries on the claims it paid in respect of the insured notes issued by Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1 CDO (collectively, the \u201cZohar Claims Payments\u201d), and the exposure in its remaining insured portfolio, which could deteriorate and result in significant additional loss reserves and claim payments, including claims on insured exposures that in some cases may require large bullet payments.\nIn July of 2019, MBIA Insurance Corporation consummated a financing facility (the \u201cRefinanced Facility\u201d) between MZ Funding LLC (\u201cMZ Funding\u201d) and certain purchasers, pursuant to which the purchasers or their affiliates (collectively, the \u201cSenior Lenders\u201d), agreed to refinance the outstanding insured senior notes of MZ Funding, and MBIA Inc. received amended subordinated notes of MZ Funding. In connection with the Refinanced Facility, the Senior Lenders purchased new senior notes issued by MZ Funding with an aggregate principal amount of $278 million. In addition, MBIA Inc. received amended subordinated notes issued by MZ Funding with an aggregate principal amount of $54 million. The Refinanced Facility is described in more detail under the \u201cLiquidity-MBIA Corp. Liquidity\u201d section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nMBIA Insurance Corporation believes that the primary source of funds for the repayment of its obligations under the Refinanced Facility and for reimbursement for the Zohar Claims Payments will come from the monetization of the loans made to, and equity interests in, companies that, until late March of 2020, were purportedly controlled and managed by the sponsor and former collateral manager of the Zohar CDOs referenced above (collectively, the \u201cZohar Collateral\u201d). In late March of 2020, the original sponsor resigned as director and manager of all but one portfolio company, and new directors and managers are currently in place at all but two portfolio companies.\nWhile MBIA Insurance Corporation believes that it will receive substantial recoveries on the Zohar Collateral, there is significant uncertainty with respect to its realizable value. Further, as the monetization process at the portfolio companies unfolds in coordination with the new directors and managers in place, and new information concerning the financial condition of the portfolio companies is disclosed, we may revise our expectations for recoveries. There can be no assurance that such information will not lead to material revisions to our expectations for the recovery from any individual portfolio company.\nIf the amount of recoveries on the Zohar Collateral is not sufficient to repay amounts due under the Refinanced Facility on or before its maturity date and to reimburse MBIA Insurance Corporation for a substantial portion of the Zohar Claims Payments, MBIA Insurance Corporation would likely incur substantial additional losses, which could materially impair its statutory capital and liquidity. Further, MBIA Insurance Corporation believes that if the NYSDFS concludes at any time that MBIA Insurance Corporation will not be able to satisfy its obligations under\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nthe Refinanced Facility and under its other issued policies, the NYSDFS would likely put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding under Article 74 of the NYIL and/or take such other actions as the NYSDFS may deem necessary to protect the interests of MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s policyholders. The determination to commence such a proceeding or take other such actions is within the exclusive control of the NYSDFS. The NYSDFS enjoys broad discretion in this regard, and any determination they may make would not be limited to consideration of the matters described above. As noted, however, given the separation of MBIA Inc. and MBIA Corp. as distinct legal entities, the absence of any cross defaults between the entities, and the lack of reliance by MBIA Inc. on MBIA Corp. for the receipt of dividends, we do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation by the NYSDFS would have any material economic long-term liquidity impact on MBIA Inc.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain transactions that continue to perform poorly and increased losses or a delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain structured finance transactions that remain volatile and could result in additional losses, which could be substantial. MBIA Corp. has also recorded significant loss reserves on its Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (\u201cCDO\u201d) exposures, and there can be no assurance that these reserves will be sufficient, in particular if the economy deteriorates. These transactions are also subject to servicer risk, which relates to problems with the transaction\u2019s servicer that could adversely affect performance of the underlying assets, As of December 31, 2020, MBIA Corp. recorded expected excess spread recoveries (the difference between interest inflows on assets and interest outflows on liabilities) of $177 million, including recoveries related to consolidated VIEs, on our RMBS transactions, in reimbursement of our past and future expected claims. Of this amount, $112 million is included in \u201cInsurance loss recoverable\u201d and $65 million is included in \u201cLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate amount of excess spread depends on the future loss trends, which include future delinquency trends, average time to charge-off/liquidate delinquent loans, the future spread between Prime and the LIBOR interest rates, and borrower refinancing behavior (which may be affected by changes in the interest rate environment), that results in voluntary prepayments. Excess spread also includes subsequent recoveries on previously charged-off loans associated with insured second-lien RMBS securitizations. There can be no assurance that this recovery will be received in its entirety or in the expected timeframe.\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences.\nAs noted above, MBIA Insurance Corporation continues to face a number of significant risks and contingencies, which could, if realized, result in MBIA Insurance Corporation being placed into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding by the NYSDFS. In the event of an MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, the Company may be subject to, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nMTNs issued by MBIA Global Funding LLC (\u201cGFL\u201d), which are insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation, would accelerate. To the extent GFL failed to pay the accelerated amounts under the GFL MTNs, the MTN holders would have policy claims against MBIA Insurance Corporation for scheduled payments of interest and principal;\n\u2022\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation proceeding may accelerate certain investment agreements issued by MBIA Inc., including, in some cases, with make-whole payments. While the investment agreements are fully collateralized with high quality collateral, the settlements of these amounts could reduce MBIA Inc.\u2019s liquidity resources, and to the extent MBIA Inc. fails to pay the accelerated amounts under these investment agreements or the collateral securing these investment agreements is deemed insufficient to pay the accelerated amounts due, the holders of the investment agreements would have policy claims against MBIA Insurance Corporation;\n\u2022\nThe payment of installment premiums due to National from MBIA Insurance Corporation under the reinsurance agreement between National and MBIA Insurance Corporation (Refer to Item 1, \u201cOur Insurance Operations\u201d, \u201cReinsurance\u201d for a description of the agreement) could be disrupted, delayed or subordinated to the claims of policyholders of MBIA Insurance Corporation;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\n\u2022\nDerivative counterparties could seek to terminate derivative contracts insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation and make market-based damage claims (irrespective of whether actual credit-related losses are expected under the underlying exposure);\n\u2022\nThe rehabilitator or liquidator would replace the Board of Directors of MBIA Insurance Corporation and take control of the operations and assets of MBIA Insurance Corporation, which would result in the Company losing control of MBIA Insurance Corporation and possible changes to MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s strategies and management; and\n\u2022\nUnplanned costs on MBIA Inc., as well as significant additional expenses for MBIA Insurance Corporation arising from the appointment of a rehabilitator or liquidator, as receiver, and payment of the fees and expenses of the advisors to such rehabilitator or liquidator.\nRevenues and liquidity would be adversely impacted by a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nDue to the installment nature of a significant percentage of its premium income, MBIA Corp. has an embedded future revenue stream. The amount of installment premiums actually realized by MBIA Corp. could be reduced in the future due to factors such as early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations, commutation of existing financial guarantee insurance policies or non-payment. Such a reduction would result in lower revenues and reduced liquidity.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nInterruption in information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including various financial intermediaries, vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If this risk is realized, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.\nDespite our implementation and maintenance of a cybersecurity program which includes a variety of security measures, our information technology systems, networks and data could be subject to cyber-attacks or physical break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive information.\nInterruption in information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions or inactions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of revenues and/or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe Company is dependent on key executives and the loss of any of these executives, or its inability to retain other key personnel, could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success substantially depends upon its human capital management including its ability to retain qualified employees and upon the ability of its senior management and other key employees to implement its business strategy. The Company believes there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which the Company operates. The Company relies substantially upon the services of William C. Fallon, Chief Executive Officer, and other senior executives. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain the services of key executives. While the Company has a succession plan for key executives and does not expect the departure of any key executives to have a material adverse effect on its operations, there can be no assurance that the loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key members of the Company\u2019s management team would not adversely affect the implementation of its business strategy.\nItem 1A.
