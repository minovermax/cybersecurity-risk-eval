{"cik": "1650962", "company": "Welbilt, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and cautionary statements described below, together with the other disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any such risks and uncertainties, as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures implemented by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, have adversely impacted and will continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including without limitation by affecting our supply chain and prices of raw materials and components.\nGlobal economic conditions will continue to be volatile as long as the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health threat. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus and new strains of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, curfews, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, vaccination mandates, social distancing measures and mandated business limitations and closures. These measures have resulted in a disruption in the foodservice industry, including substantial restaurant closures and, as a result, in commercial foodservice equipment markets across the geographies in which we operate. We expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy subsides. Pandemic-related developments have impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations in multiple ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We have experienced and may experience in the future, a reduced demand for our products, which requires us to modify our production schedules, which has negatively impacted and could negatively impact our business and financial performance in the future. If the global economic effects caused by the pandemic continue or increase, demand for our products may decrease, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022We have taken protective measures to modify our production environment to promote the health and safety of our workers which has had an impact, and may continue to have an impact, on our productivity.\n\u2022The pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.\n\u2022If a significant portion of our workforce or our suppliers\u2019 workforce is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, either directly or due to governmental mandates or otherwise, associated work stoppages or facility closures could halt or delay production.\n\u2022Continued disruptions and uncertainties related to the pandemic for a sustained period could result in delays to the implementation of our Transformation Program or modifications to our strategic plans and hinder our ability to achieve our cost savings objectives.\n\u2022The financial impact of the pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants contained in agreements governing our indebtedness, potentially resulting in a default or an acceleration of indebtedness and could otherwise negatively impact our liquidity and ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\n\u2022Weaker economic conditions may result in a decrease in fair value of our tangible or intangible assets, which, in turn, could result in an impairment charge in our financial statements.\n\u2022We have experienced some disruption in our operations due to higher than normal absenteeism among our production employees and difficulties in replacing such employees with temporary or new hires; further disruption could materially and adversely affect our operations.\n\u2022As further described below, we have experienced disruptions and are likely to experience additional shipping and logistics delays and disruptions to our supply chain, resulting in delays, difficulties and increased costs of acquiring components and raw materials.\n\u2022We could incur delays in shipments of our products, which could harm our customer relations and adversely impact our sales.\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to see increases in the cost of specific commodities, components and parts purchased, as well as in the average cost of commodities, components and parts purchased, as compared to the prior year, driven both by rising inflation rates and rising tariffs, as challenges in the supply chain and shipping and logistics delays continued to persist. The availability of key electronic components used in embedded electronic controls worsened in 2021, and we expended significant effort and resources to redesign controls to utilize available parts and to source these electronic components on the spot market, often at a large premium to historical prices.\nThe extent of the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend significantly on future developments, which cannot be predicted with certainty, including emergence of new variants of the virus, the duration, and severity of the pandemic, mandates and recommended safety measures implemented to contain or mitigate its impact in each of the countries in which we operate, the development of treatments, efficacy and availability of vaccines, the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, particularly with respect to the foodservice industry. We may continue to experience the effects of the pandemic even after it has waned, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could continue to be affected. Due to the inherent uncertainty of such factors, we cannot predict the extent or materiality of the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business with certainty or confidence at this time; however, it has\nalready had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position, and could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial position compared to our current expectations.\nProposed vaccination mandate, if implemented, is likely to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOn November 5, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced an emergency temporary standard mandating the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing for most U.S. employees, which includes our employees. That standard was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court on January 13, 2022. However, the Biden Administration has indicated that it may seek to impose alternative vaccine mandates and other governmental authorities have imposed more targeted vaccine and testing orders and regulations, and may continue to do so in the future. If a mandate is ultimately issued and implemented in some form, we expect there would be further disruptions to our operations, such as inability to maintain adequate staffing at our facilities, difficulties in replacing disqualified employees with temporary employees or new hires, increased costs and diminished availability of raw materials and component parts, and increased compliance burdens, including financial costs, diversion of administrative resources, and increased downtimes to accommodate for any required ongoing COVID-19 testing, which would result in delays in the manufacturing process, negatively impact our future sales levels and ongoing customer relationships.\nOur business and financial results are dependent on our ability to execute our manufacturing strategies, including our ability to scale our manufacturing capacity and resources to the level of our customers\u2019 demand.\nOur business and financial results depend upon our ability to timely and efficiently execute our manufacturing strategies without disruption to our business, including reducing excess manufacturing capacity, completing plant acquisitions or closures, consolidating existing facilities and operations and renovating existing plants and facilities as needed. We must make highly efficient use of manufacturing capacity to generate competitive profit margins and achieve our stated financial goals, while also managing the risk of insufficient capacity which may expose us to liabilities related to contract commitments. Adapting or modifying our capacity is difficult, as modifications take substantial time to execute and, in some cases, may require regulatory approval. Additionally, delivering products during process or facility modifications requires special coordination. The cost and resources required to adapt our capacity, such as through facility acquisitions, facility closings, or process moves between facilities, as well as coordinating any related reductions or changes in our workforce, may negate any planned cost reductions or may result in costly delays, product quality issues or material shortages, all of which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation with our customers.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement cost-reduction initiatives and strategies, or the corresponding cost savings prove to be insufficient, we may not achieve our earnings targets.\nIn recent years, we have adopted several cost-saving initiatives and operating strategies intended to drive increased profit margins, including, for example, reducing the complexity of our product offerings, and incorporating strategic sourcing. The success these initiatives and strategies is not guaranteed, and we may not achieve the full cost savings we expect or any anticipated benefits might be realized later than expected. These initiatives often involve significant cultural shifts, both internally and for our customers, that may inhibit, delay or impair its successful implementation. Any additional delays in implementing or lower-than-expected benefits from our cost-saving initiatives and strategies may cause us to miss earnings targets and otherwise negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, if we devote a disproportionate amount of time, personnel and resources to initiatives that yield slower or less than anticipated results or that are ultimately unsuccessful, we may be distracted from other initiatives and priorities that might have yielded more rapid or better results, and our results of operations may suffer.\nIf we do not develop new and innovative products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change or respond to introductions of new products by competitors, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur strategy of creating new and innovative products and solutions for our customers requires significant time and investment toward product innovation, design, development and testing, all of which are necessary to meet our customers\u2019 needs, compete with frequent new product introductions and enhancements and comply with evolving regulatory requirements in the numerous geographic markets we serve. Moreover, some of our competitors manufacture a more narrow product offering, allowing them to concentrate their research and development efforts more directly on products and services for those areas than we may be able to do. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products on a rapid and ongoing basis. If we do not successfully develop new and innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors' products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and earnings would suffer. In addition, if we are unable to deliver products, features, and functionality as projected, we may be unable to meet our commitments to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation. Any development efforts could divert resources from other potential investments in our business, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings do. Even with rigorous testing prior to release and investment on product quality processes, problems may be found in newly developed or enhanced products after such products are launched and shipped to customers. Resolution of such issues may cause project delays, additional development costs, and deferred or lost revenue.\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality and reliability standards and expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers\u2019 decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, increase in warranty costs, and/or damage to our reputation. Similarly, if we fail to provide high level of quality through our KitchenCare aftermarket parts and service segment as we provide in original equipment manufacturing, our revenue and our reputation with our customers could be negatively affected.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are outside of our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality products that our customers expect, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and impair our reputation and lead to higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship and in some cases materials on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 to 60 months with certain equipment having longer term warranties. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales of our products outside of the U.S., which may present additional risks to our business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 37%, 37% and 38%, respectively, of our net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the U.S. We intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets and expect to expend resources in doing so. We are subject to various risks related to conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022potential adverse changes or increased uncertainty relating to the political, social, religious and economic stability of the countries in which we do business or such countries' diplomatic relations with the U.S.;\n\u2022the imposition by U.S. and foreign governments of additional taxes, tariffs, economic sanctions, embargoes or other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u2022difficulties in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations, including but not limited to our ability to obtain or retain necessary licenses or recruit qualified personnel under local labor market conditions;\n\u2022our ability to comply with complex international laws and regulations that may change unexpectedly, differ, or conflict with laws in other countries in which we conduct business;\n\u2022concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and environmental impact in foreign countries where goods are produced and materials or components are sourced, and changing labor, environmental and other laws in these countries;\n\u2022adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any hedging transactions;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contractual rights;\n\u2022inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries;\n\u2022unanticipated delays or disruptions in the global supply chain; and\n\u2022our ability to effectively transfer cash between foreign entities and/or jurisdictions, including in a manner that is consistent with our strategic goals and priorities.\nAny of these risks or other risks relating to international operations and sales could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our business has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by regional or global health crises, including outbreaks of\ncontagious diseases such as COVID-19. A significant outbreak of a contagious disease and other adverse public health developments, or the fear of such events, could adversely affect global supply chains, economies and financial markets. Any prolonged economic disruption could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs previously disclosed, we voluntarily disclosed to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") certain errors in the declaration of imported products relating to quantity, value, classification, North American Free Trade Agreement eligibility and other matters as well as potential\nviolations of antidumping and countervailing duties. Following such disclosures, we began a comprehensive review of its import practices in order to quantify the loss of revenue to CBP. Based on our completed analyses, we determined the costs of potential loss for customs duties, fees, and interest owed for previously imported products to be $3.1 million and have reflected this charge in \"Restructuring and other expense\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn mid-February 2021, we submitted the completed analysis to CBP and remitted the aforementioned amount due. Significant judgment was required in determining the amounts due to the CBP and although we believe our estimate to be reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of this matter will be consistent with what has been recorded and remitted by us. To the extent that the final outcome of this matter is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will be recorded in the period in which such determination is made.\nOn January 27, 2022, one of our Mexican subsidiaries received a notification from the Mexican taxing authority of the preliminary findings identified during a tax audit for the period of April 1, 2016 - February 27, 2018. The preliminary findings stated that the Mexican subsidiary did not evidence the export of goods temporarily imported under Mexico\u2019s Manufacturing, Maquila and Export Services Industries Program (\u201cIMMEX Program\u201d), therefore allegedly triggering the obligation for payment of import duties, fines and surcharges. In response to the notification, on February 1, 2022, we filed a petition outlining our disagreement with the preliminary findings as we believe that appropriate documentation evidencing the export of the goods has been provided to the taxing authority. To date, we have not received a response to its petition.\nWhile we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this tax audit, based on currently known information we do not believe a loss contingency is either probable or estimable. Accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded in our financial statements as of December 31, 2021 related to this matter. However, if the final resolution of the tax matter is not favorable to our company, a charge will be recorded in our consolidated financial statements at such time as the range of loss becomes both probable and estimable.\nOur business and/or reputation could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nCertain of our stockholders may in the future publicly or privately express views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that may not fully align with our own. Also, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the manufacturing industry may lead to increased activism focusing on companies such as ours and their suppliers. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nActivist stockholders may in the future make strategic proposals, suggestions, or requests for changes concerning the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations, or other matters. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any consequences arising from these actions, and any such consequences may impact the value of our securities.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Transaction with Ali Holding S.r.l.\nThere are several risks and uncertainties related to the proposed transaction (the \"Transaction\") with Ali Holding S.r.l. (\"Ali Group\").\nThe Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions to both our obligations and the obligations of Ali Group to complete the Transaction, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Transaction may not be completed on a timely basis or at all.\nThe completion of the Transaction is subject to several of customary conditions to closing and there can be no assurance that such conditions to closing that remain outstanding will be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by law). The failure to timely satisfy the required conditions could delay the completion of the Transaction for a significant period of time or prevent the completion of the Transaction from occurring at all. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining closing conditions include, among others, (i) expiration or termination of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and receipt of applicable approvals under certain foreign competition, antitrust or merger control laws, (ii) there being no law or order prohibiting consummation of the Transaction, (iii) subject to specified materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, (iv) compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective covenants, (v) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to us and Ali Group, and (vi) the delivery of an officer\u2019s closing certificate by both parties.\nMany of the conditions to completion of the Transaction are not within either our or Ali Group\u2019s control, and neither company can predict when, or if, these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to July 14, 2022 (subject to extension if certain approvals have not been obtained by such date), it is possible that the agreement and the plan of merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") may be terminated. Although we and Ali Group have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use reasonable best efforts to, subject to certain limitations, complete the Transaction as promptly as practicable, these and other conditions to the completion of the Transaction may fail to be satisfied. In addition, satisfying the conditions to and completion of the Transaction may take longer, and could cost more, than we and Ali Group expect. We cannot and Ali Group cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals, including the completion of the Ice Divestiture, could delay the completion of the Transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. There can be no assurance that all required regulatory\napprovals will be obtained or obtained prior to the termination date. The governmental agencies from which the parties have sought or are seeking certain approvals in connection with the Transaction have broad discretion in administering applicable regulations, and may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures in addition to the Ice Divestiture or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business after the closing. Such requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could delay or prevent the consummation of the Transaction.\nFailure to consummate the Transaction could negatively impact the share price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Transaction is not consummated, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the potential benefits of having consummated the Transaction, we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022We may experience negative reactions from our customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, business partners and employees;\n\u2022We will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the Transaction whether or not the Transaction is consummated, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022Matters relating to the Transaction (including integration planning) may require substantial management time and resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u2022We could become subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the Transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $110 million to Ali Group.\nIf the Transaction is not consummated, these risks may materialize and may materially and adversely affect our business, operations, financial results and share price.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities prior to the Effective Time.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects us to restrictions on our business activities prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement obligates us to generally conduct our businesses in the ordinary course until the Effective Time and to use our reasonable best efforts to (i) preserve our assets and business organization, (ii) maintain our existing relationships and goodwill with material customers, suppliers, distributors, governmental authorities and business partners, and (iii) to keep available the services of our officers and key employees. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that arise prior to the Effective Time.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternatives to the Transaction.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, following receipt of stockholder approval of the Transaction on September 30, 2021, we are prohibited from soliciting alternative business combination proposals from third parties, engaging in discussion or negotiations with respect to such proposals or providing information in connection with such proposals. While we believe these provisions and agreements are reasonable and customary, these provisions restrict us from engaging with a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the merger consideration.\nWhile the Transaction is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Transaction on our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors and other business partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transaction is consummated and for a period thereafter. If, despite our retention efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, the combined company\u2019s (or, if the Transaction is not consummated, our standalone company) business could be harmed and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could be adversely affected.\nParties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers and suppliers may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with other parties. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, our results of operations or our prospects, including an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the Transaction. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, completion of the Transaction may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which we are a party.\nWe and Ali Group are targets of legal proceedings that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed.\nAs disclosed in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings - The Ali Merger Cases\u201d below, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, Welbilt is currently a named defendant in eight separate litigations (collectively, the \u201cAli Cases\u201d) arising in connection with a Proxy Statement Welbilt filed with the SEC on August 31, 2021 in connection with the merger between Welbilt and Ali Group. Securities class action lawsuits, derivative lawsuits and other legal proceedings are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if such legal proceedings are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Transaction, such injunction may delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation.\nWe and Ali Group will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Transaction.\nWe and Ali Group expect to incur substantial non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Transaction. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, retention, severance, change in control and other integration-related costs, filing fees and printing costs. The costs described above and any unanticipated costs and expenses, many of which will be borne by us even if the Transaction is not completed, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur directors and executive officers have interests in the Transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nOur directors and executive officers have interests in the Transaction that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The interests of our directors and executive officers include, among others, severance rights, vesting protections for equity awards in the event of termination of employment in connection with a change in control, rights to continuing indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. Our board of directors was aware of and carefully considered the interests of our respective directors and officers, among other matters, in evaluating the terms and structure, and overseeing the negotiation of the Transaction, in approving the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and the recommendation of our board of directors that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and the degree to which we are leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total consolidated indebtedness was $1,401.6 million. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product innovation, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or requiring us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings bear variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and thereby have greater financial flexibility.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our existing indebtedness as well as any future indebtedness that we may incur and to fund planned capital expenditures and other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations or asset sales as well as our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, all of which are subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, the lenders could accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, including to fund acquisitions, or for general corporate purposes, which could adversely affect our financial health and decrease our profitability.\nWe may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness or raise additional capital in the future, subject to the terms and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness. In addition, we may issue shares of preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our cash requirements, we may require additional financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. If we incur additional indebtedness or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the risks described above that we now face could intensify. Further, the terms of such indebtedness or preferred stock may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nUncertainty about the continuing availability of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nThe interest rates under some of our loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments, including the 2016 Credit Agreement, which governs the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, are calculated by reference to LIBOR. The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced in 2017 that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates required for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, the cessation date for most LIBOR tenors was extended to June 30, 2023.\nIn addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. These may be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or other benchmark rates over the next several years. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. These changes, and related uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing. If LIBOR ceases to exist, then we and the administrative agent will endeavor to amend the 2016 Credit Agreement to establish an alternate rate of interest that will apply, giving due consideration to then-prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, tax legislation impacts, or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere, and such changes may result in, among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR, increased borrowing costs, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, difficulty and costly processes to amend applicable contracts and instruments and difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing and hedging efforts.\nOur debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility.\nThe terms of the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the high yield notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our ability to borrow under our senior secured credit facilities is subject to compliance with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. We report the status of our compliance with these covenants quarterly. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our funded debt, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.\nOur senior secured credit facilities include other restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability to incur new indebtedness; grant liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and liquidations; make asset dispositions, restricted payments including dividends and investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and amend, modify or prepay certain indebtedness. The indenture governing the high yield notes contains limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events as well as other limitations, including limitations on: the declaration and payment of dividends or other restricted payments; incurring additional indebtedness or issuing preferred stock; the creation or existence of certain liens; incurring restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments; transactions with affiliates; and the sale of assets.\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates.\nWe have indebtedness that accrues interest at a variable rate. Increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions or dividends. In such cases we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but hedging our exposure carries the risk that we may forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates were to change in our favor. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy is guaranteed to adequately insulate us from the risks associated with such fluctuations.\nIndustry and Macroeconomic Risks\nPrice increases, disruption of supply or our inability to successfully manage our exposures to price fluctuations of our raw materials could adversely affect our profitability and harm our business.\nWe use large amounts of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, electronic controls and component parts, among other materials, in the manufacturing of our products. Occasionally, market prices of some of our key raw materials increase significantly, due to tariffs or otherwise, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories and,\nin some instances, rely upon single sources of supply, shortages or even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers, including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, natural disasters, acts of war (including the ongoing armed conflict in Eastern Europe) or terrorism, pandemics or other events outside our control, may increase our production costs, cause delays in the shipment of our products, impair our ability to satisfy customer demand and adversely affect our business and financial performance. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to experience disruptions to our supply chain, resulting in delays, difficulties in obtaining, and increased costs of acquiring raw materials and component parts. If these disruptions to our supply chain were to worsen, our ability to meet our production demands would be adversely affected which could adversely affect our business operations, earnings and financial condition.\nIncreases in compensation, wage pressure, and other expenses for our employees and the employees of our suppliers may adversely affect our profitability. Increases in other operating costs may increase our cost of products sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses. Our inability to effectively mitigate inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have historically hedged a portion of our commodity exposures through derivative financial instruments to fix the future price for a portion of these commodities used in the manufacturing of our products. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe participate in an industry that is highly competitive, which could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nWe sell our products in a highly competitive industry. We compete based on product design, product quality, performance and reliability, quality and responsiveness of product support services, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. This competition as well as competitors' pricing decisions could cause our sales to decrease or compel us to reduce our prices to remain competitive, either of which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemands to reduce our prices by a small number of buying groups, which have significant purchasing power in our industry, could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nA substantial portion of our dealer revenue comes from a small number of buying groups, which gives those buying groups a large degree of leverage and purchasing power with us and our competitors. In recent years, those buying groups have used their leverage to extract larger rebates, discounts and other price reductions. If, as a result of increased leverage, buying groups require us to further reduce prices, we may experience reduced margins or choose not to sell our products to particular buying groups, which could result in a decrease in revenues.\nWe rely on independent dealers and distribution partners to sell our products, and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely significantly on a global network of independent, regional dealers and distributors to market and distribute our products. Our dealer and distributor arrangements are non-exclusive and allow such parties to represent and promote competing products to the detriment of our products. Dealers and distributors may be unwilling or unable to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of product offerings. In addition, our distributors could retain inventory levels that exceed their future anticipated sales, which could thereby affect our future sales to those distributors. The loss of a significant number of distributors or dealers, or an increase in our distributors' or dealers' sales of our competitors' products could materially reduce our sales and profits. Furthermore, failure of our distributors to adhere to our policies designed to promote compliance with global anti-corruption laws, export controls, and local laws, could subject us to criminal or civil penalties and harm our brand and reputation.\nChanging consumer tastes and government regulations affecting the QSR industry could negatively affect sales to our largest customers.\nSeveral of our largest customers operate in the Quick Service Restaurant (\"QSR\") industry. The QSR industry is frequently affected by changes in consumer tastes and eating habits, often as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or as a result of government regulations requiring QSRs to disclose the nutritional content of food. If consumers\u2019 eating habits change significantly, our customers may choose or be required to modify their menu offerings or cooking methods. Such modifications, or the failure to make the modifications to the extent consumers desire, could have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows, which in turn could adversely affect customers' demand for our products.\nRecent changes in trade policies, including the imposition of additional tariffs, could continue to adversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government began implementing major changes to certain trade policies, such as the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products and the withdrawal from or renegotiation of certain trade agreements, including the recently ratified trilateral trade agreement with the governments of Canada and Mexico, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"). It remains to be seen if these changes will continue under the new U.S. Administration. Such changes could also result in retaliatory actions by the United States\u2019 trade partners. For example, the U.S. government has threatened to undertake adverse actions relating to trade with Mexico, including the closure of the border and the imposition of escalating tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from Mexico. If adopted, such actions could adversely impact our business and disrupt our operations.\nAdditionally, the previous Administration has recently increased tariffs on certain imports from China, as well as on steel and aluminum products imported from various countries. In response, China, the EU, and several other countries have imposed or proposed additional tariffs on certain exports from the United States. These actions have resulted in an increased cost of materials for our products and may cause our products to become less competitive due to price increases or less profitable due to lower margins. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nSales of our products may be impacted by economic conditions and other factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in weather or other factors could adversely affect us.\nHistorically, sales of products have been subject to variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the strength of the economy generally may affect the rates of expansion, consolidation, renovation and equipment replacement within the restaurant, hospitality, retail and healthcare industries, which may affect our sales. Any future economic recession may impact leveraged companies like us more than competing companies with less leverage and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our business may be negatively impacted by uncertainty and disruptions related to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland from the EU, including potential disruptions to our supply chain, increased costs from the re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and the EU, shipping delays due to new customs inspections and import/export processes and increased volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. The United Kingdom's inability to negotiate a favorable trade agreement with the EU or with other trading partners may result in an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further short-term uncertainty and currency volatility. Other risks may increase, such as the risk that other countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the EU, the economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, or the long-term stability of the Euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our European operations, have an adverse effect on demand our products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally.\nWeather conditions can also substantially affect our business, as relatively cool summer weather and cooler-than-normal weather in hot climates tend to decrease sales of ice and beverage dispensers. Our sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause customers to forgo or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur higher fixed costs, and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share.\nWe are exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations.\nSome of our operations are or may be conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries will be reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, which are stated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between many foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Such fluctuations may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nWe also incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a transaction using a different currency than its functional currency. We attempt to reduce currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a material transaction using a different currency than its functional currency by:\n\u2022matching cash flows and payments in the same currency;\n\u2022direct foreign currency borrowing; and\n\u2022entering into foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes.\nHowever, we may not be able to hedge such a risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nSecurity breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary information of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our internal and external data centers, cloud services, and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. The number and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions that companies have experienced from third parties has\nincreased over the past several years. It is impossible for us to eliminate risks of such attacks. Our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of roll-outs of new systems. In addition, because techniques used by computer programmers and hackers (many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded) to access or sabotage networks and computer systems change frequently and often are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques.\nIn the event of a data or cybersecurity attack, breach or operational failure, our networks and those of our partners may be compromised or experience interruptions in operations and the information stored on such networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, subject to ransom demands, lost or stolen. We may also be required to expend substantial time and resources to modify or enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. Furthermore, certain breaches or attacks could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, we may face financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may fail to anticipate or adequately mitigate increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal or fraudulent activities perpetrated against us.\nDespite the defensive measures that we take to manage threats to our business, our risk and exposure to potential illegal or fraudulent activities remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of such threats in light of advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, new and sophisticated methods used by criminals including phishing, vishing, social engineering or other illicit acts, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to adequately mitigate.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are involved in litigation that is unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we become involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business, including lawsuits, claims, investigations or proceedings pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, environmental matters, commercial disputes, warranty claims, trade practices and employment matters. While we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit, claim, investigation or proceeding with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. We refer to the disclosure in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d under \u201cThe Middleby Merger Cases\u201d and \u201cThe Ali Group Merger Cases\u201d for a description of recent and ongoing litigation, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and the other countries in which we do business. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with all such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors, dealers, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or these regulations. Failure by us or our distributors to comply with such laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement, including monetary fines and possible injunctions against our shipment of product or other activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\nWhile we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing anti-kickback and false claims, competition, fraud, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related stockholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits.\nWe are subject to potential product liability risks that relate to the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these product liability claims. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future product liability claims, there can be no assurance that our coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Significant losses not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, it may be necessary for us to recall products that do not meet approved specifications, which could result in adverse publicity as well as costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur patents, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our businesses. Although we protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. In some cases, including with respect to several of our most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors. In the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources, either of which could adversely affect our business.\nAny infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, our products and services.\nThird parties may assert or prosecute infringement or validity claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Regardless of whether these claims have any merit, such claims can be burdensome and costly to defend or settle and can harm our business and reputation. In addition, if a third-party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third-party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and profitability could suffer if we experience labor relations problems.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 4,800 people worldwide. Our employees include workforce resources from six employee unions in North America, two trade unions and a local works council in Europe and two trade unions in China. Our union contracts and labor agreements are renegotiated periodically, and we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements on a timely basis, we may experience strikes, work stoppages, delays or other issues which could disrupt our business. Any significant labor relations issues, including issues related to the renewal of expiring union contracts, could adversely affect our operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecent and anticipated changes to tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted in 2017, made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect 2017 and subsequent years. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was enacted on March 27, 2020 and includes several measures intended to assist companies during the COVID-19 pandemic including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. Future legislative and regulatory guidance under the Tax Act, CARES Act, United Kingdom's departure from the EU and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development initiatives, including the global anti-base erosion proposal envisaging global minimum taxation, represent significant changes that could have a material effect upon our effective tax rate, future earnings and cash flows. With the recent changes in the Legislative and Executive branches of the U. S. Government, there is an increased likelihood of additional tax legislation being passed in the near future, which could also have a material effect upon our effective tax rate, future earnings and cash flows.\nWe regularly undergo tax audits in various jurisdictions in which our products are sold. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially affect our operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments.\nWe have significant pension obligations with respect to our employees and our available cash flow may be adversely affected in the event that payments become due under any defined benefit plans that are unfunded or underfunded.\nA portion of our active and retired employees participate in defined benefit plans under which we are obligated to provide prescribed levels of benefits regardless of the value of the underlying assets, if any, of the applicable defined benefit plan. If our obligations under a plan are unfunded or underfunded, we will have to use cash flow from operations and other sources to pay our obligations either as they become due or over some shorter funding period. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $18.2 million in unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our defined benefit plans.\nCompliance with regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nIn recent years, governments in both the U.S. and Europe have implemented or proposed regulations governing the use of certain minerals, including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, which we collectively refer to as conflict minerals. In the U.S., SEC rules require disclosures related to conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC-reporting company, that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in central Africa. In the E. U., regulations effective January 1, 2021 require similar disclosures and encompass other geographic regions outside of central Africa.\nThese disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to conclusively verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or determine that our products are \"conflict free,\" we may face reputational challenges with our customers or investors. Furthermore, we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \"conflict free,\" which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \"conflict free\" metals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. For all of these reasons, we could incur significant costs related to the conflict minerals compliance process and face equally significant costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards;\n\u2022announcements of significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022investor perception of our company and the foodservice industry;\n\u2022overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Accordingly, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. We are also required to disclose any change that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC, we could face severe consequences, and our reputation could be harmed which in turn could affect the value of our securities.\nWe may not realize expected benefits from acquisitions of or investments in new businesses, products, or technologies, which could harm our business.\nAs part of our strategy, we may pursue growing our company through the acquisition of businesses, products or technologies. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or integrate newly acquired businesses.\nEnvironmental liabilities that may arise in the future could be material to us.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. As a result, we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental and health and safety matters, and we have in the past and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures relating to such matters. The possibility of discovering presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities, or other unanticipated events may give rise to additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and/or penalties that could be material. Further, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect any changes may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management members could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies.", "PERMNO": 15921, "SIC": 3580, "TIC": "WBT"}
