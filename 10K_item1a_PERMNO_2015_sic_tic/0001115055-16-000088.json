{"cik": "1115055", "company": "PINNACLE FINANCIAL PARTNERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to our company, our industry and our market areas. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be materially and negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline in future periods.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability.\nThe absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates may affect our level of interest income, the primary component of our gross revenue, as well as the level of our interest expense. Interest rate fluctuations are caused by many factors which, for the most part, are not under our control. For example, national monetary policy plays a significant role in the determination of interest rates. Additionally, competitor pricing and the resulting negotiations that occur with our customers also impact the rates we collect on loans and the rates we pay on deposits.\nIn December 2015, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate from 0% to 0.25% to 0.50%. As interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience \"gaps\" in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings) will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities), or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \"gap\" may work against us, and our earnings may be negatively affected. During 2014 and 2015, and in anticipation of expected additional increases in short term interest rates in 2016, we reduced the amount of variable rate loans with interest rate floors by approximately $462 million. We believe that the reduction in the amount of variable rate loans with interest rate floors should better position our balance sheet for a rising rate environment. In the event that short-term interest rates don't continue to rise in 2016, or those rates rise more slowly than we are anticipating, our efforts to transition our balance sheet to a more asset sensitive position may negatively impact our results of operations as we may earn less interest on these loans than we would have had we maintained these loan floors.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses. Because we continue to have a significant number of loans with interest rate floors above current rates, in a rising rate environment our liabilities may reprice faster than our loans, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have entered into certain hedging transactions including interest rate swaps, which are designed to lessen elements of our interest rate exposure. In the event that interest rates do not change in the manner anticipated, such transactions may not be effective.\nWe have a concentration of credit exposure to borrowers in certain industries, and we also target small to medium-sized businesses.\nWe have meaningful credit exposures to borrowers in certain businesses, including commercial and residential building lessors, new home builders, and land subdividers. These industries experienced adversity during 2008 through 2010 as a result of sluggish economic conditions, and, as a result, an increased level of borrowers in these industries were unable to perform under their loan agreements with us, or suffered loan downgrades which negatively impacted our results of operations. If the economic environment in our markets weakens in 2016 or beyond, these industry concentrations could result in increased deterioration in credit quality, past dues, loan charge offs and collateral value declines, which could cause our earnings to be negatively impacted. Furthermore, any of our large credit exposures that deteriorate unexpectedly could cause us to have to make significant additional loan loss provisions, negatively impacting our earnings.\nA substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market areas. As a result, a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans primarily to small to medium-sized businesses. At December 31, 2015, our commercial and industrial loans accounted for almost 34.1% of our total loans, up from 31.5% at December 31, 2010. Additionally, approximately, 16.6% of our loans at December 31, 2015 are owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, which are loans to businesses secured by the businesses' real estate. We expect to seek to expand the amount of such loans in our portfolio in 2016. During periods of lower economic growth like those we have experienced in recent years, small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of such businesses to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nDespite recent acquisitions we have made, we remain principally geographically concentrated in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability.\nPrior to our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, we operated primarily in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and most of our borrowers, depositors and other customers lived or had operations in these areas. With our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, we have increased our presence in the Knoxville MSA and expanded our operations into the Chattanooga, Tennessee - Georgia MSA and surrounding counties and the Memphis, Tennessee - Mississippi - Arkansas MSA, but the significant majority of our borrowers remain situated in the Nashville, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee MSAs, and our proposed acquisition of Avenue will further increase the number of borrowers we have in the Nashville, Tennessee MSA. Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets, along with the continued attraction of business ventures to these areas, and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in these markets. We cannot assure you that economic conditions, including loan demand, in our markets will improve during 2016 or thereafter, and in that case, we may not be able to grow our loan portfolio in line with our expectations, the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us may be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nEven with our acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna, compared to regional or national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies as we remain dependent on the economic environment within the State of Tennessee. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or return of more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nOur acquisitions and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nIn 2015, we completed the acquisitions of CapitalMark and Magna. On January 28, 2016 we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement which provides for the merger of Avenue with and into Pinnacle Financial with Pinnacle Financial continuing as the surviving corporation. Avenue Bank and Pinnacle Bank will likewise merge if that transaction is consummated. We currently expect to consummate the Avenue merger in late second quarter or early third quarter in 2016.\nWe expect to continue to expand in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis through additional branches and also may consider expansion within these markets and Nashville through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including:\nManagement of Growth. We may be unable to successfully:\n\u00b7\nmaintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u00b7\navoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of the acquired institution;\n\u00b7\nmaintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth;\n\u00b7\nmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\u00b7\nimplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nOperating Results. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets.\nDevelopment of Offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The same is true for our efforts to expand in these markets with the hiring of additional seasoned professionals with significant experience in that market. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our new branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired, as the case may be.\nRegulatory and Economic Factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering our expected markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover losses inherent in our portfolio, our earnings will decrease.\nIf loan customers with significant loan balances fail to repay their loans, our earnings and capital levels will suffer. We make various assumptions and judgments about the probable losses in our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of any collateral securing the loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to cover our estimate of the probable losses in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of this allowance, we utilize estimates based on analyses of volume and types of loans, internal loan classifications, trends in classifications, volume and trends in delinquencies, nonaccruals and charge-offs, loss experience of various loan categories, national and local economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan quality indications, and other pertinent factors and information. If our assumptions are inaccurate, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover potential loan losses, and additional provisions may be necessary which would decrease our earnings.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize loan charge-offs. Their conclusions about the quality of a particular borrower or our entire loan portfolio may be different than ours. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans, (including those we acquired in the Mergers) identification of additional problem loans, accounting rule changes and other factors, both within and outside of our management's control. These additions may require increased provision expense which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nNegative developments in the U.S. and local economy may adversely impact our results in the future.\nEconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate deteriorated significantly between early 2008 and the middle of 2010. These challenges manifested themselves primarily in the form of increased levels of provisions for loan losses and other real estate expense related to declining collateral values in our real estate loan portfolio and increased costs associated with our portfolio of other real estate owned. Although economic conditions appear to have stabilized and strengthened in our markets in the more recent periods and we have refocused our efforts on growing our earning assets, we believe that we will continue to experience a slower growth economic environment in 2016. Accordingly, we expect that our results of operations could be negatively impacted by economic conditions, including reduced loan demand, in 2016. There can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry, and the capital, credit and real estate markets, generally, or us in particular, will improve materially, or at all, in the near future, or thereafter, in which case we could experience reduced earnings or again experience significant losses and write-downs of assets, and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate CapitalMark, Magna or Avenue or to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers.\nWe are still in the process of integrating CapitalMark and Magna, and, upon consummation of the proposed Avenue merger, will begin the process of integrating Avenue. A successful integration of these banks' operations with our operations will depend substantially on our ability to consolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may not be able to combine our operations with the operations of CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue without encountering difficulties, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u00b7\nthe disruption of operations and business;\n\u00b7\ninability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n\u00b7\nloan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss;\n\u00b7\npossible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\nunexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; and/or\n\u00b7\nproblems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from regular banking operations.\nAdditionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue.\nFurther, we acquired CapitalMark and Magna, and have entered into the definitive agreement to acquire Avenue, with the expectation that these mergers will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these mergers is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, we made fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording the CapitalMark and Magna mergers, and, upon consummation of the proposed Avenue merger, will make such estimates in recording the Avenue merger. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of such mergers. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nThe combined company will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the mergers of CapitalMark and Avenue.\nWe expect to incur significant costs associated with combining the operations of CapitalMark (for whom we have scheduled systems conversions for March 2016) and Avenue with our operations. We continue to work diligently to finalize detailed integration plans to deliver anticipated cost savings, but additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the businesses of CapitalMark, Magna and Avenue. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWhether or not the Avenue merger is consummated, we will incur substantial expenses, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, in pursuing the Avenue merger which will adversely impact our earnings until after the acquisition has been completed. Completion of the Avenue merger is conditioned upon the receipt of all material governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including approval by federal banking regulators. We and Avenue intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the merger agreement.\nFailure to complete the Avenue merger could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf the Avenue merger is not completed for any reason, our stock price may decline because costs related to the Avenue merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the Avenue merger is not completed. In addition, if the Avenue merger is not completed, our stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Avenue merger will be completed.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions (as we have aggressively done in 2015 and 2016), we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above, in general acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u00b7\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of our management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n\u00b7\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nentry into new markets where we lack experience; and\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current and expected markets and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nImplementation of the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act. This landmark legislation includes, among other things, (i) the creation of a Financial Services Oversight Counsel to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation; (ii) the elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the transfer of oversight of federally chartered thrift institutions and their holding companies to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve; (iii) the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products that would affect banks and non-bank finance companies; (iv) the establishment of new capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies; (v) the termination of investments by the U.S. Treasury under TARP; (vi) enhanced regulation of financial markets, including the derivatives, securitization and mortgage origination markets; (vii) the elimination of certain proprietary trading and private equity investment activities by banks; (viii) the elimination of barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks; (ix) a permanent increase of FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000; (x) the authorization of interest-bearing transaction accounts; and (xi) changes in how the FDIC deposit insurance assessments will be calculated and an increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nCertain provisions of the legislation were not immediately effective or are subject to required studies and implementing regulations. Further, community banks with less than $10 billion in assets (like us at December 31, 2015) are exempt from certain provisions of the legislation. However, we currently expect to exceed $10 billion in assets upon consummation of our proposed merger with Avenue, which will cause us to become subject to these additional regulations, and, as described below, our results of operations may be materially impacted by the additional costs to comply with these additional regulations as well as the higher costs associated with increased deposit insurance premiums.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing requirements. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Currently, Pinnacle Bank is subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the FDIC is primarily responsible for examining our compliance with consumer protection laws and those CFPB regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is uncertainty as to how the CFPB's examination and regulatory authority might impact our business.\nOnce our assets exceed $10 billion, we will be required, under the Dodd-Frank Act, to submit annually a stress test to the Federal Reserve that projects our performance in various economic scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act stress tests are forward-looking exercises conducted by the Federal Reserve and financial companies regulated by the Federal Reserve to help ensure institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during adverse economic conditions. Once we become required to perform these stress tests, we will be required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable. The outcome of the Federal Reserve's analysis of our projected performance (to include capital, earnings, and balance sheet changes) will be used in supervision of us and will assist the Federal Reserve in assessing our risk profile and capital adequacy. The results of any stress test that we are required to perform could hinder our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends to shareholders as has been our practice, and could also impact decisions made by the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators regarding future acquisitions or investments by us or Pinnacle Bank.\nIn addition, once our assets exceed $10 billion, we will be subject to the Durbin Amendment promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Durbin Amendment, interchange fees for debit card transactions are capped at $0.21 plus five basis points. This limitation on interchange fees will adversely impact our results of operations.\nCompliance with these requirements that will become applicable to us once we exceed $10 billion in total assets may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may also be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities. To ensure compliance with these heightened requirements when effective, our regulators may require us to fully comply with these requirements or take actions to prepare for compliance even before our total assets equal or exceed $10 billion. As a result, we may incur compliance-related costs before we might otherwise be required, including if we are unable to consummate our merger with Avenue or do not continue to grow at the rate we expect or at all. Our regulators may also consider our preparation for compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nAlthough several regulations implementing portions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been promulgated, we are still unable to predict how this significant legislation may be interpreted and enforced or how implementing regulations and supervisory policies may affect us. There can be no assurance that these or future reforms will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nWhile our board of directors has approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock since the fourth quarter of 2013, there can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be dividends that we receive from Pinnacle Bank. Although Pinnacle Bank's asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from Pinnacle Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay. For example, Federal Reserve Board regulations implementing the capital rules required under Basel III do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers that began to apply on January 1, 2016 and are being phased in over three years.\nIn addition, the terms of the indentures pursuant to which our subordinated debentures have been issued, and the terms of the subordinated notes Pinnacle Financial will assume upon the consummation of the Avenue merger, prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock at times when we are deferring the payment of interest on our subordinated debentures or the subordinated notes Pinnacle Financial will assume upon consummation of the Avenue merger.\nOur ability to grow our loan portfolio may be limited by, among other things, economic conditions, competition within our market areas, the timing of loan repayments and seasonality.\nOur ability to continue to improve our operating results is dependent upon, among other things, aggressively growing our loan portfolio. While we believe that our strategy to grow our loan portfolio is sound and our growth targets are achievable over an extended period of time, competition within our market areas is significant, particularly for borrowers whose businesses have been less negatively impacted by the challenging economic conditions of the last few years. We compete with both large regional and national financial institutions, who are sometimes able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we choose to offer, and smaller community-based financial institutions who seek to offer a similar level of service to that which we offer. This competition can make loan growth challenging, particularly if we are unwilling to price loans at levels that would cause unacceptable levels of compression of our net interest margin or if we are unwilling to structure a loan in a manner that we believe results in a level of risk to us that we are not willing to accept. Moreover, loan growth throughout the year can fluctuate due in part to seasonality of the businesses of our borrowers and potential borrowers and the timing on loan repayments, particularly those of our borrowers with significant relationships with us, resulting from, among other things, excess levels of liquidity.\nOur investment in BHG may not produce the contribution to our results of operations that we expect.\nOn February 4, 2015 we acquired a 30% interest in BHG for $75 million in cash. On January 19, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire an additional 19% interest in BHG for $114.0 million payable in a mix of cash and shares of our common stock. We currently expect, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, to close the additional investment in early March. Although we have made other investments in businesses that we do not control, this is the largest investment of this type that we have made. While we have a significant stake in BHG, are entitled to designate one member of BHG's four person board of managers (and upon the closing of the additional investment, we will be entitled to designate two of the five members of BHG's board of managers) and in some instances have protective rights to block BHG from engaging in certain activities, we do not control BHG and the other managers and members of BHG may make most decisions regarding BHG's operations without our consent or approval, including a decision to sell BHG subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (although, upon the closing of the additional investment, the board of managers of BHG will not be permitted to validly approve a sale of BHG without the consent of one of the two managers appointed by us for four years). Any sale of all or a portion of our interest in BHG would adversely affect our noninterest income. Moreover, there are certain limitations on our ability to sell our interest in BHG without first offering BHG and the other members a right of first refusal, and, upon the closing of the additional investment, we will be prohibited from transferring any portion of our interest without the consent of the other members of BHG for five years, other than transfers in connection with an acquisition of Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank or as a result of a change in applicable law that forces us and/or Pinnacle Bank to divest our or Pinnacle Bank's ownership interests in BHG.\nA significant portion of BHG's revenue (and correspondingly our interest in any of BHG's net profits) comes from the sale of loans originated by BHG to community banks. Moreover, the purchase price we paid to acquire our interest in BHG (including the amount we agreed to pay in connection with the additional investment) was based on our expectation that BHG will continue to grow its business and increase the amount of loans that it is able to originate and sell. In the event that BHG's loan growth slows over historical levels or its loan sales decrease (including as a result of regulatory restrictions on banks that are the principal purchasers of BHG's loans), its results of operations and our non-interest income would be adversely affected. BHG currently operates in most states without the need for a permit or any other license. In the event that BHG was required to register or become licensed in any state in which it operates, or regulations are adopted that seek to limit BHG's ability to operate in any jurisdiction or that seek to limit the amounts of interest that BHG can charge on its loans, BHG's results of operations (and our and Pinnacle Bank's interest in BHG's net profits) could be materially and adversely affected.\nBHG's business, while not regulated directly by any federal bank regulators, may become subject to increased scrutiny as it grows or as a result of our investment. The FDIC has published guidance related to the operation of marketplace lenders and banks' business relationship with such lenders. Were BHG to become subject to direct regulation by any state or federal banking regulators, its compliance costs may increase and its loan yields may be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact its results of operations and our and Pinnacle Bank's interest in BHG's net profits. Were banks that are examined by the FDIC restricted in their ability to buy loans originated by BHG, BHG's business would be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our interest in BHG's profits.\nOur loan portfolio includes a meaningful amount of real estate construction and development loans, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nAlthough we have made meaningful progress over the last three years in reducing our concentration of real estate construction and development loans, the percentage of these loans in Pinnacle Bank's portfolio was approximately 11.4% of total loans at December 31, 2015. These loans make up approximately 25.9% of our non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. This type of lending is generally considered to have relatively high credit risks because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful completion and operation of the related real estate project. The credit quality of many of these loans deteriorated during the challenging economic period of 2008 to 2012 due to the adverse conditions in the real estate market during that period and that type of deterioration could occur again. Weakness in residential real estate market prices as well as demand could result in price reductions in home and land values adversely affecting the value of collateral securing the construction and development loans that we hold. Should we experience the return of these adverse economic and real estate market conditions we may again experience increases in non-performing loans and other real estate owned, increased losses and expenses from the management and disposition of non-performing assets, increases in provision for loan losses, and increases in operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of loans, all of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to capital requirements for bank holding companies and depository institutions that became effective January 1, 2015 and continue to be phased in may negatively impact Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's results of operations.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Pinnacle Bank and Pinnacle Financial. The final rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The final rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Moreover, these rules refine the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% (to be phased in over three years beginning January 1, 2016) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets in 2016 and will increase by a like amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. We will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if our capital levels fall below these minimums plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nUnder these new rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets at that date, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.\nThe final rules allow banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. Both Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank opted-out of this requirement.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Pinnacle Financial and Pinnacle Bank, like those adopted to implement the Basel III reforms, could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, (like the subordinated notes we issued in connection with our mergers with CapitalMark and Magna) and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nImplementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back shares.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, Pinnacle Bank may acquire, through foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased which are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we, or Pinnacle Bank, might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNational or state legislation or regulation may increase our expenses and reduce earnings.\nBank regulators are increasing regulatory scrutiny, and additional restrictions (including those originating from the Dodd-Frank Act) on financial institutions have been proposed or adopted by regulators and by Congress. Changes in tax law, federal legislation, regulation or policies, such as bankruptcy laws, deposit insurance, consumer protection laws, and capital requirements, among others, can result in significant increases in our expenses and/or charge-offs, which may adversely affect our earnings. Changes in state or federal tax laws or regulations can have a similar impact. State and municipal governments, including the State of Tennessee, could seek to increase their tax revenues through increased tax levies which could have a meaningful impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, financial institution regulatory agencies are expected to continue to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the continued issuance of additional formal or informal enforcement or supervisory actions. These actions, whether formal or informal, could result in our agreeing to limitations or to take actions that limit our operational flexibility, restrict our growth or increase our capital or liquidity levels. Failure to comply with any formal or informal regulatory restrictions, including informal supervisory actions, could lead to further regulatory enforcement actions. Negative developments in the financial services industry and the impact of recently enacted or new legislation in response to those developments could negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, industry, legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction, capital strategies, compensation or operating plans.\nOur ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets and deteriorating economic and market conditions.\nWe, and Pinnacle Bank, are required to maintain certain capital levels established by banking regulations or specified by bank regulators, including those capital maintenance standards imposed on us as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we are required to serve as a source of strength to Pinnacle Bank. We must also maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our operations and fund outstanding liabilities. Our ability to maintain capital levels, sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets in which we operate and deteriorating economic and market conditions. Pinnacle Bank is required to obtain regulatory approval in order to pay dividends to us unless the amount of such dividends does not exceed its net income for that calendar year plus retained net income for the preceding two years. Any restriction on the ability of Pinnacle Bank to pay dividends to us could impact our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock. Moreover, failure by our bank subsidiary to meet applicable capital guidelines or to satisfy certain other regulatory requirements could subject our bank subsidiary to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities.\nCertain of our deposits and other funding sources may be volatile and impact our liquidity.\nIn addition to the traditional core deposits, such as demand deposit accounts, interest checking, money market savings and certificates of deposits less than $250,000, we utilize or in the past have utilized several noncore funding sources, such as brokered certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Cincinnati advances, federal funds purchased and other sources. We utilize these noncore funding sources to fund the ongoing operations and growth of Pinnacle Bank. The availability of these noncore funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions and to investor assessment of our financial strength and, as such, the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly and/or be restricted, thus impacting our net interest income, our immediate liquidity and/or our access to additional liquidity. We have somewhat similar risks to the extent high balance core deposits exceed the amount of deposit insurance coverage available.\nWe impose certain internal limits as to the absolute level of noncore funding we will incur at any point in time. Should we exceed those limitations, we may need to modify our growth plans, liquidate certain assets, participate loans to correspondents or execute other actions to allow for us to return to an acceptable level of noncore funding within a reasonable amount of time.\nIf the federal funds and interbank funding rates remain at current extremely low levels, our net interest margin, and consequently our net earnings, may be negatively impacted.\nBecause of significant competitive pressures in our market and the negative impact of these pressures on our deposit and loan pricing, coupled with the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio has variable rate pricing that moves in concert with changes to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' federal funds rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (both of which are at extremely low levels as a result of current economic conditions), our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Additionally, the amount of non-accrual loans and other real estate owned has been and may continue to be elevated. We also expect loan pricing to remain competitive in 2016 and believe that economic factors affecting broader markets will likely result in reduced yields for our investment securities portfolio. As a result, our net interest margin, and consequently our profitability, may continue to be negatively impacted in 2016 and beyond.\nA decline in our stock price or expected future cash flows, or a material adverse change in our results of operations or prospects, could result in impairment of our goodwill.\nA significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization below book value, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of our goodwill. At December 31, 2015, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets totaled approximately $442.8 million. If we were to conclude that a write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then the appropriate charge would likely cause a material loss. Any significant loss would further adversely impact the capacity of Pinnacle Bank to pay dividends to us without seeking prior regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our ability to pay required interest payments.\nCompetition with other banking institutions could adversely affect our profitability.\nA number of banking institutions in our geographic markets have higher lending limits, more banking offices, and a larger market share of loans or deposits than we do. In addition, our asset management division competes with numerous brokerage firms and mutual fund companies which are also much larger. In some respects, this may place these competitors in a competitive advantage. This competition may limit or reduce our profitability, reduce our growth and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services in the Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis and Chattanooga markets. Moreover, much of our organic loan growth in 2012 through 2015 was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. Inability to retain these key personnel (including key personnel of CapitalMark or Magna) or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals' skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them.\nWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.\nWe are from time to time subject to certain litigation in the ordinary course of our business. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. The outcome of these cases is uncertain. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our or Pinnacle Bank's capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, we may issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. We may sell these shares at prices below the current market price of shares, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute shareholder ownership. We could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions or investments in fee-related businesses such as BHG, which would also dilute shareholder ownership.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's Global Select Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nHolders of Pinnacle Financial's and Pinnacle Bank's indebtedness and junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of Pinnacle Financial's stockholders.\nPinnacle Financial has issued trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. At December 31, 2015, Pinnacle Financial had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $82.5 million. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by Pinnacle Financial. Further, the accompanying junior subordinated debentures Pinnacle Financial issued to the trusts are senior to Pinnacle Financial's shares of common stock. As a result, Pinnacle Financial must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on common stock and, in the event of Pinnacle Financial's bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on Pinnacle Financial's common stock. Pinnacle Financial has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock. If our financial condition deteriorates or if we do not receive required regulatory approvals, we may be required to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures.\nOn July 30, 2015, Pinnacle Bank issued $60 million of subordinated notes due July 30, 2025 in a private placement to certain institutional accredited investors. These notes are obligations of Pinnacle Bank, and not Pinnacle Financial, and the notes rank senior to shares of Pinnacle Bank's common stock, all of which are owned by Pinnacle Financial. In the event of a liquidation or winding up of Pinnacle Bank, these notes, along with Pinnacle Bank's other indebtedness, would have to be repaid before Pinnacle Financial and its shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Pinnacle Bank.\nUpon consummation of the proposed merger with Avenue, Pinnacle Financial will assume Avenue's obligations under its outstanding $20.0 million subordinated notes issued in December 2014 that mature in December 2024. These notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per annum until January 1, 2020 and may not be repaid prior to such date. Beginning on January 1, 2020, if not redeemed on such date, these notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period plus 495 basis points. The terms of these notes will prohibit Pinnacle Financial from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on its common stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring or making a principal payment on these notes, at any time when payment of interest on these notes has not been timely made and while any such accrued and unpaid interest remains unpaid. Moreover, the notes will rank senior to shares of Pinnacle Financial's common stock. In the event of a liquidation or winding up of Pinnacle Financial, these notes, along with Pinnacle Financial's other indebtedness, would have to be repaid before Pinnacle Financial's shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Pinnacle Financial.\nPinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank may from time to time issue additional subordinated indebtedness that would have to be repaid before Pinnacle Financial's shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Pinnacle Financial or Pinnacle Bank.\nOur business is dependent on technology, and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. We have made significant investments in data processing, management information systems and internet banking accessibility. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create additional efficiencies in our operations through the use of technology. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We cannot make assurances that our technological improvements will increase our operational efficiency or that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nWe are subject to various statutes and regulations that may impose additional costs or limit our ability to take certain actions.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged on loans, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capital requirements established by our regulators, which require us to maintain specified levels of capital. It is possible that our FDIC assessments may increase in the future. Any future assessment increases could negatively impact our results of operations. Significant changes in laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have been recently adopted and others are being considered in Congress. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.", "PERMNO": 89395, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PNFP"}
