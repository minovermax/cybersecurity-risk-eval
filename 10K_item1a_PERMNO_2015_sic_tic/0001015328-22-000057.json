RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe summary of risks below provides an overview of the principal risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities. This summary does not contain all of the information provided in the detailed discussion of risks that follows this summary and should be read together with such detailed discussion.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating Environment\n\u2022Includes risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and related environmental sustainability matters, deterioration in economic conditions and economic declines in the Chicago metropolitan and southern Wisconsin market areas, since our business is concentrated in these regions.\nRisks Related to Competition and Reputation\n\u2022Includes risks related to our ability to compete effectively, damage to our reputation, consumers deciding not to use banks to complete their financial transactions and the impact on us from the soundness of other financial institutions.\nRisks Related to Growth and Acquisitions\n\u2022Includes risks related to our ability to identify favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions, our participation in FDIC-assisted acquisitions, new lines of business and new products and services and de novo operations that often involve significant expenses and delayed returns.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022Includes risks related to our ability to meet regulatory capital ratios, changes in the United States\u2019 monetary policy, legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future regarding the financial services industry, financial reform legislation and increased regulatory rigor around consumer protection mortgage-related issues, federal, state and local consumer lending laws that may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans, regulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements that may require heightened capital, any increase in our FDIC insurance premiums, any non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, BSA or other laws and regulations, claims and legal actions, examinations and challenges by tax authorities, changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, changes in accounting policies or accounting standards and changes in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs.\nRisks Related to Lending Operations\n\u2022Includes risks related to our allowance for credit losses and sufficiency to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio, litigation from the banks\u2019 customers or other parties regarding the banks\u2019 processing of loans for the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) and that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties, the repayment of commercial loans which are largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower, our loan portfolio being secured by real estate, in particular commercial real estate, events impacting collateral consisting of real property, any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models and environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nRisks Related to Our Niche Businesses\n\u2022Includes risks related to our premium finance business, which may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations, widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers and exposure to certain risks associated with the securities industry.\nRisks Related to Financial Strength and Liquidity\n\u2022Includes risks related to changes in prevailing interest rates, our liquidity position, an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, our credit rating, capital not being available when it is needed or the cost of that capital being very high, disruption in the financial markets, being a bank holding company and therefore being limited in sources of funds, including to pay dividends, and uncertainty about the transition from LIBOR to alternate benchmark interest rates.\nRisks Related to General Operations\n\u2022Includes risks related to our controls and procedures, our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, security risks (including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion and data corruption attempts), the failures of vendors, cybersecurity risks associated with debit cards and debit card transactions, the accuracy and completeness of information we receive about\nour customers and counterparties to make credit decisions, our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, losses incurred in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market and the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as acts of war, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and public health threats.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. Certain material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect Wintrust are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair Wintrust\u2019s business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating Environment\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material.\nAlthough the U.S. and global economies have begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains. The growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures. All of our three primary business segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management, have been uniquely impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring the implementation of certain responses as circumstances evolve. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the rate of distribution and administration of vaccines globally, the severity and duration of any resurgence of COVID-19 variants, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this Item 1A.\nWe have continued to maintain appropriate levels of our allowance for loan losses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic could cause us to recognize heightened credit losses in our loan portfolio and additional increases in our allowance for loan losses. Certain portions of our lending portfolio are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, we could experience additional draws on lines of credit, downward pressure on deposits, and increased loan delinquencies. The effects of COVID-19 may impair the value of collateral securing our loans, especially commercial and residential real estate loans. Further, a significantly larger amount of delinquent mortgage loans may result in us having to repurchase or substitute loans that we have sold in the secondary market.\nMarket interest rates declined significantly during the pandemic, but we expect that the temporary reduction of interest rates to near zero will be reversed, with the Federal Reserve now signaling its concerns with respect to inflation and announcing that it will begin to taper its purchases of mortgage and other bonds. The timing and impact of this expected reversal in interest rates trends is unknown. The lower interest rate environment has negatively affected our interest rate margin and, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income and profitability. Further, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, may increase our cost of capital, may prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, and could result in a downgrade in our credit ratings. The negative economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially if prolonged, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, many of our employees have been working remotely. We may experience increased costs of operations or other operational difficulties, including increased cybersecurity risk, due to the remote working environments of our employees. We may also experience additional operational risk due to difficulties\nexperienced by our vendors. The effects of the pandemic and measures taken in response may subject us to increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of the pandemic or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s impact on the domestic and global economy. Accordingly, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (including without limitation our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and credit ratings) is highly uncertain, unpredictable and depends on factors including, among other things, new information that may emerge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the availability and efficacy of vaccines, the emergence of variant strains of the virus and responses to the pandemic by the government, businesses and consumers.\nDeterioration in economic conditions may materially adversely affect the financial services industry and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and abroad, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, and the strength of the domestic economies in which we operate. The deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations.\nAs a lending institution, our business is directly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, as well as by the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures many of our loans. Any economic deterioration from current levels or slowing of current economic activity could lead to an increase in loan charge-offs and negatively affect consumer confidence as well as the level of business activity. Net charge-offs totaled $21.5 million in 2021 from $40.3 million in 2020. Our balance of non-performing loans and other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) was $74.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021 compared to $127.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Deterioration in the economy and real estate markets, higher inflation, rising interest rates or increased unemployment rates, particularly in the markets in which we operate, will likely diminish the ability of our borrowers to repay loans that we have made to them, decrease the value of any collateral securing such loans and may cause increases in delinquencies, problem assets, charge-offs and provision for credit losses, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted may not prevent losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince our business is concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan and southern Wisconsin market areas, economic declines in the economy of this region could adversely affect our business.\nExcept for our premium finance business and certain other niche businesses, our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Chicago metropolitan and southern Wisconsin market areas. The local economic conditions in these areas significantly impact the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources.\nIn addition, the State of Illinois has experienced significant financial difficulty in recent years. To the extent that these issues impact the economic vitality of the state and the businesses operating in Illinois, businesses may be encouraged to leave the state or new employers may be discouraged to start or move businesses to Illinois, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change manifesting as transition, physical or other risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses, customers, reputation and financial condition.\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will entail\nextensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences, additional regulatory requirements or taxes and additional counterparty or customer requirements, could increase our expenses, undermine our strategies and impact our financial condition. In addition, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our clients\u2019 involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have begun to develop and continue to enhance processes, to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies established for risks such as market, credit and operational risks; however, because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable, our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure.\nRisks Related to Competition and Reputation\nThe financial services industry is very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business could suffer.\nWe face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services (including wealth management services) throughout our market area. Our competitors include national, regional and other community banks, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, factoring companies and other non-bank financial companies such as marketplace lenders and other financial technology (\u201cFinTech\u201d) companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and market presence or more advanced technology than Wintrust and, as a result of their size, may be able to offer a broader range of products and services, better pricing for those products and services, or newer technologies to deliver those products and services than we can. Several of our local competitors have experienced improvements in their financial condition over the past few years and are better positioned to compete for loans, acquisitions and personnel. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. For example, the Economic Growth Act and its implementing regulations significantly reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as mobile payment and other automatic transfer and payment systems, and for banks that do not have a physical presence in our markets to compete for deposits. The absence of regulatory requirements may give non-bank financial companies a competitive advantage over Wintrust.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service and high ethical standards;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022the ability to uphold our reputation in the marketplace;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our market share and income from deposits, loans and other products may be reduced. This could adversely affect our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation may harm our business.\nMaintaining trust in the Company is critical to our ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. If our reputation is damaged, our business could be significantly harmed. Harm to our reputation could arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. Our reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate or a vendor or other third party with which we do business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, our reputation or prospects could be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the Company, whether or not true, that\nmay be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during and after the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions or that a financial institution had acted inappropriately with respect to the methods employed in offering products to customers, have damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole.\nIn addition, increased focus on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) issues, including without limitation the impact of climate change, could damage our reputation or prospects if customers, prospective customers, investors or third parties assigning ESG ratings to the Company are of the opinion that the Company\u2019s practices, including without limitation our lending practices, are not sufficiently robust from an ESG perspective.\nShould any of these or other events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to our reputation would not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations, or that damage to our reputation will not impair our ability to retain our existing customers and employees or attract new customers and employees. Harm to our reputation or the reputation of our industry may also result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to changes in laws or regulations that could constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation may also increase our litigation risk.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d), commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk as well as market and liquidity risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us. Any such losses could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Growth and Acquisitions\nIf we are unable to continue to identify favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions, our growth may be limited and our results of operations could suffer.\nIn the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions of banks, other financial service related companies and financial service related assets, including acquisitions of troubled financial institutions, as more fully described below. We expect to continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Wintrust seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management, possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions may result in Wintrust achieving slower growth.\nThe Economic Growth Act could result in increased competition for merger or acquisition partners, potentially resulting in higher acquisition prices or an inability to complete desired acquisitions. In addition, the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions will be evaluated are currently in flux and some banking organizations are experiencing delays in the processing of applications. In July 2021, President Biden issued an executive order on competition that requires the banking agencies to review the standards for bank mergers and the DOJ has announced that it is reviewing its bank merger guidelines. It\nis expected that these reviews will tighten the standards for bank mergers and may change how the financial stability factor is evaluated. In addition, some members of Congress have called for a moratorium of any bank merger and acquisition of greater than $100 billion in assets. While the Company is still much smaller in asset size than $100 billion, we cannot exclude the possibility that we may be subject to higher antitrust standards, enhanced scrutiny under the financial stability risk factor, or have a potential acquisition denied.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n(1)potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities or asset quality issues of the target company;\n(2)failure to adequately estimate the level of loan losses at the target company;\n(3)difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n(4)potential disruption to our business, including diversion of our management's time and attention;\n(5)the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;\n(6)difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and\n(7)potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Wintrust\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur as a result of any future acquisitions. In addition, certain acquisitions may expose us to additional regulatory risks, including from foreign governments. Our ability to comply with any such regulations will impact the success of any such acquisitions. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business and new products and services are essential to our ability to compete but may subject us to additional risks.\nWe continually implement new lines of business and offer new products and services within existing lines of business to offer our customers a competitive array of products and services. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, such as the rapid adoption of mobile payment platforms. The effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. However, some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of our competitors, because of their larger size and available capital, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could cause a loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAt the same time, there can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets for such services are still developing. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products or services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDe novo operations often involve significant expenses and delayed returns and may negatively impact Wintrust's profitability.\nOur financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by our strategy of branch openings and de novo bank formations. We expect to increase the opening of additional branches and may, under certain circumstances, resume de novo bank formations. It may take longer than expected or more than the amount of time Wintrust has historically experienced for new banks and/or banking facilities to reach profitability, and there can be no guarantee that these branches or banks will ever be profitable. Moreover, the FDIC's enhanced supervisory period for de novo banks of three years, including higher capital\nrequirements during this period, could also delay a new bank's ability to contribute to the Company's earnings and impact the Company's willingness to expand through de novo bank formation. To the extent we undertake additional de novo bank, branch and business formations, our level of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets will be impacted by startup costs associated with such operations, and it is likely to continue to experience the effects of higher expenses relative to operating income from the new operations. These expenses may be higher than we expected or than our experience has shown, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios, we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets.\nAs a banking institution, we are subject to regulations that require us to maintain certain capital ratios, such as the ratio of our Tier 1 capital to our risk-based assets, and in recent years these regulatory and market expectations have increased substantially. If our regulatory capital ratios decline, as a result of decreases in the value of our loan portfolio or otherwise, we may be required to improve such ratios by either raising additional capital or by disposing of assets. If we choose to dispose of assets, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so at prices that we believe to be appropriate, and our future operating results could be negatively affected. If we choose to raise additional capital, we may accomplish this by selling additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, which could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of holders of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Additionally, events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase our capital costs and impair our ability to raise capital at any given time.\nChanges in the United States\u2019 monetary policy may restrict our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner.\nOur ability to profitably operate is dependent, in part, upon federal fiscal policies that cannot be predicted. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which influence money supply in the United States. Any change in the United States\u2019 monetary policy, or worsening federal budgetary pressures, could affect our access to capital. Additionally, any trend toward inflation, economic decline, destabilizing of financial markets, or other factors beyond our control may significantly affect consumer demand for our products and consumers\u2019 ability to repay loans, reducing our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the outbreak, or in a response to what is being characterized as a current inflationary environment, or the precise effects that future changes in monetary policies may have on our activities and financial results.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future regarding the financial services industry may significantly increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be substantial and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. While we are unable to predict the scope or impact of any potential legislation or regulatory action until it becomes final, it is possible that changes in applicable laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impact the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, require us to increase our regulatory capital, interfere with our executive compensation plans, or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner including our plan for de novo growth and growth through acquisitions.\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. For example, as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA. The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, see \u201cProtection of Client Information\u201d under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1.\nRegulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. We expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nIn addition, we expect that the Biden Administration and the Democratically-controlled Congress will continue to seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the Trump Administration. This reform agenda could include a heightened focus on the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny. We also expect reform proposals for the short-term wholesale markets. At this time, we are unable to assess which, if any of these policies, would be implemented and what their impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations would be.\nFinancial reform legislation and increased regulatory rigor around consumer protection mortgage-related issues may reduce our ability to market our products to consumers and may limit our ability to profitably operate our mortgage business.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority over a wide range of federal consumer protection laws applicable to the business of our subsidiary banks and some other operating subsidiaries, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices, but examination and supervision of our subsidiary banks is carried out by the primary federal banking agency and, where applicable, the state banking agency. Consumer protection is an area of heightened regulatory focus, and the CFPB has promulgated a number of specific regulatory requirements in this area. These rules have increased and may further increase the costs of doing business for all market participants, including our subsidiaries.\nIn particular, the mortgage-related rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Company. For example, in order to ensure compliance with mortgage-related rules issued by the CFPB, the Company consolidated its consumer mortgage loan origination and loan servicing operations within Wintrust Mortgage.\nIn the wake of the mortgage crisis of 2007-2008, the CFPB and federal and state banking agencies are closely examining the mortgage and mortgage servicing activities of depository financial institutions. Should these or other agencies have serious concerns with respect to our operations in this regard, the effect of such concerns could have a material adverse effect on our profits.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. The CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related rules since it was established under the Dodd-Frank Act, including rules relating to the ability to repay loans and relating to qualified mortgage standards. Most of these mortgage-related rules have been adopted, although portions of certain of these rules have not yet become effective. In addition, several proposed revisions to mortgage-related rules are pending finalization. We may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the CFPB rules, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers' ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make. In addition, regulation related to redlining, fair lending, CRA compliance and BSA compliance create significant burdens which necessitate increased costs. Any failure to comply with any of these regulations could have a significant impact on our ability to operate, our ability to acquire or open new banks and/or result in meaningful fines.\nRegulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements may require heightened capital.\nThe U.S. Basel III Rule, as well as other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to banking organizations, have increased our compliance costs, impacted the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to\noperations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to engage in capital distributions, including paying dividends or repurchasing stock, may be restricted if we do not maintain the required Capital Conservation Buffer. In addition, we anticipate that our pro forma capital ratios will be an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve in evaluating whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases are consistent with its prudential expectations. For more information regarding capital requirements, see \u201cCapital Requirements of the Company and Subsidiary Banks\u201d under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1.\nOur FDIC insurance premiums may increase, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nInsured institution failures leading up to and following the financial crisis, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, significantly increased FDIC loss provisions, resulting in a decline of its deposit insurance fund to historical lows at the peak of the crisis. In response, the Dodd-Frank Act and FDIC regulations changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to average total consolidated assets less average tangible capital, eliminated the maximum size of the DIF, eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds, and increased the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35%. These developments also caused our FDIC insurance premiums to increase. There is a risk that the banks' deposit insurance premiums will increase in the future if failures of insured depository institutions once again deplete the DIF. Any such increase may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, BSA or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act and the BSA require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering or the funding of terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require certain financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. An increasing number of banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to claims and legal actions that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nPeriodically, as a result of our normal course of business, we are involved in claims and related litigation from our customers, employees or other parties. These claims and legal actions, whether meritorious or not, as well as reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies could involve large monetary claims and significant legal expense. In addition, such actions may negatively impact our reputation in the marketplace and lessen customer demand. If such claims and legal actions are not decided in Wintrust's favor, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities that may impact our financial results.\nIn the normal course of business, we, as well as our subsidiaries, are routinely subject to examinations from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged. Recently, federal and state tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to among other things tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in federal and state tax laws and changes in interpretation of existing laws can impact our financial results.\nThe federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) on December 22, 2017, and given the changing economic and political environment and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of further new federal or state tax legislation may occur. The enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions\nimpacting tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, credits and exemptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards could materially adversely affect how we report our financial results and financial condition.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and financial condition. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes, such as the CECL standard adopted on January 1, 2020, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere continues to be discussion and dialogue in the U.S. government regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase, which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customers\u2019 margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt. This in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. It remains unclear what the U.S. government or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. It is also unclear what changes, if any, to U.S. trade policy will be made by the Biden Administration and Congress, particularly in light of the mid-term elections in 2022.\nOn October 1, 2018, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to a new trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. On January 29, 2020, then-President Trump signed the USMCA into law. The full impact of the USMCA on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate is currently unknown. Changes to the terms upon which the United States, Mexico and Canada trade could negatively affect our customers or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Lending Operations\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses that is intended to absorb expected lifetime credit losses related to our loan portfolio, off-balance sheet credit exposures and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio. At each balance sheet date, our management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on our estimate of expected credit losses over the life of the related asset with consideration of historical credit losses, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nBecause our allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of lifetime losses, there is no certainty that it will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolios, particularly if there are changes in expectations of general economic or market conditions, or events that adversely affect specific customers. In 2021, we charged off $21.5 million in loans (net of recoveries) and decreased our allowance for credit losses from $379.9 million at December 31, 2020 to $299.7 million at December 31, 2021. Our allowance for loan and unfunded lending-related commitment losses represents 0.86% and 1.18% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAlthough we believe our allowance for credits losses is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses in our loan portfolio, if our estimates are inaccurate and our actual credit losses exceed the amount that is anticipated, or if the forecasts and assumptions used in calculating our reserves are significantly different from those we actually experience, our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nFor more information regarding our allowance for loan losses, see \u201cLoan Portfolio and Asset Quality\u201d under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company and its banks are subject to additional risks of litigation from the banks\u2019 customers or other parties regarding the banks\u2019 processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nFrom April 3, 2020 through the end of the program in the second quarter of 2021, we originated over 19,400 PPP loans with a carrying balance totaling approximately $4.8 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying balance of such loans was reduced to approximately $558.3 million primarily resulting from forgiveness by the SBA. The PPP program expired on May 31, 2021.\nSince the launch of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP, as well as litigation regarding the alleged nonpayment of fees that may be due to certain agents who facilitated PPP loan applications. Although many of these lawsuits have subsequently been dismissed, the Company and the banks may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the banks regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or its banks and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the banks, such litigation may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company and one of its banks were named as defendants in a putative class action, which has been dismissed with prejudice, regarding the alleged nonpayment of agency fees.\nRegardless of outcome, litigation can be costly and divert the Company\u2019s attention and resources. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPPP loans are fixed, low interest rate loans that are guaranteed by the SBA and subject to numerous other regulatory requirements, and a borrower may apply to have all or a portion of the loan forgiven. If PPP borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness, banks face a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time. While the PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, various regulatory requirements will apply to banks\u2019 ability to seek recourse under the guarantees, and related procedures are subject to uncertainty.\nParticipating banks also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the banks, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower.\nThe repayment of our commercial loans is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower. If the economy weakens for a prolonged period or experiences deterioration or if the industry or market in which the borrower operates weakens, our borrowers may experience depressed or dramatic and sudden decreases in revenues that could hinder their ability to repay their loans. Excluding PPP loans that include a guarantee from the SBA, our commercial loan portfolio totaled $11.3 billion or 33% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2021, compared to $9.2 billion, or 29% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2020.\nCommercial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Should a commercial loan require us to foreclose on the underlying collateral, the unique nature of the collateral may make it more difficult and costly to liquidate, thereby increasing the risk to us of not recovering the principal\namount of the loan. Accordingly, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by defaults in this portfolio.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, in particular commercial real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets could lead to additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 34% and 36%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio was secured by real estate, the majority of which is commercial real estate. The commercial and residential real estate market continues to experience a variety of difficulties, including the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, in which a majority of our real estate loans are concentrated. Increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net charge-offs and increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEvents impacting collateral consisting of real property could lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate located in the Chicago metropolitan area. Any declines in economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors impacting these local markets could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for our mortgage loans is located could adversely affect the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan, and in turn the value of our assets. In addition, any natural disasters or severe weather events have the potential to damage our real estate collateral. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends and increase the occurrence and severity of such adverse weather events.\nAny inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models could cause us to miscalculate our projected revenue, capital, liquidity or losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe use analytical and forecasting models to estimate the effects of economic conditions on our loan portfolio and probable loan performance. Those models reflect certain assumptions about market forces, including interest rates and consumer behavior that may be incorrect. If our analytical and forecasting models\u2019 underlying assumptions are incorrect, improperly applied, or otherwise inadequate, we may suffer deleterious effects such as higher than expected loan losses, lower than expected net interest income, lower than expected liquidity, lower than expected capital or unanticipated charge-offs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. In addition, we own and operate a number of properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks.\nEnvironmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and could materially reduce the affected property's value or limit the Company's ability to use or sell the affected property. The costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Although the Company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Niche Businesses\nOur premium finance business may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations, and could expose us to losses.\nWe provide financing for the payment of property and casualty insurance premiums and life insurance premiums on a national basis through FIRST Insurance Funding and Wintrust Life Finance, respectively, and financing for the payment of property and casualty insurance premiums in Canada through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FIFC Canada. Property and casualty insurance premium finance loans involve a different, and possibly higher, risk of delinquency or collection than life insurance premium finance loans and the loan portfolios of our bank subsidiaries because these loans are issued primarily through relationships with a large number of unaffiliated insurance agents and because the borrowers are located nationwide. As a result, risk management and general supervisory oversight may be difficult. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.9 billion of property and casualty insurance premium finance loans outstanding, of which $4.2 billion related to the Company's U.S. operations at FIRST Insurance Funding and $677.0 million related to the Company's Canadian operations at FIFC Canada. Together, these loans represented 14% of our total loan portfolio as of such date.\nFIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada may also be more susceptible to third party fraud with respect to property and casualty insurance premium finance loans because these loans are originated and many times funded through relationships with unaffiliated insurance agents and brokers. In the second quarter of 2010, for example, fraud perpetrated against a number of premium finance companies in the industry, including the property and casualty division of FIRST Insurance Funding, increased both the Company's net charge-offs and provision for credit losses by $15.7 million. Acts of fraud are difficult to detect and deter, and we cannot assure investors that our risk management procedures and controls will prevent losses from fraudulent activity.\nWintrust Life Finance may be exposed to the risk of loss in our life insurance premium finance business because of fraud. While Wintrust Life Finance maintains a policy prohibiting the known financing of stranger-originated life insurance and has established procedures to identify and prevent the company from financing such policies, Wintrust Life Finance cannot be certain that it will never provide loans with respect to such a policy. In the event such policies were financed, a carrier could potentially put at risk the cash surrender value of a policy, which serves as Wintrust Life Finance's primary collateral, by challenging the validity of the insurance contract for lack of an insurable interest.\nSee the below risk factor \u201cWidespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of FIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada\u201d for a discussion of further risks associated with our insurance premium finance activities.\nWhile FIRST Insurance Funding and Wintrust Life Finance are licensed as required and carefully monitor compliance with regulation of each of their businesses, there can be no assurance that either will not be negatively impacted by material changes in the regulatory environment. FIFC Canada is not required to be licensed in most provinces of Canada, but there can be no assurance that future regulations which impact the business of FIFC Canada will not be enacted.\nAdditionally, to the extent that affiliates of insurance carriers, banks, and other lending institutions add greater service and flexibility to their financing practices in the future, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected. Wintrust Life Finance's life insurance premium finance business could be materially negatively impacted by changes in the federal or state estate tax provisions. There can be no assurance that FIRST Insurance Funding and Wintrust Life Finance will be able to continue to compete successfully in its markets.\nWidespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of FIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada.\nFIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada's premium finance loans are primarily secured by the insurance policies financed by the loans. These insurance policies are written by a large number of insurance companies geographically dispersed throughout the country. Our premium finance receivables balances finance insurance policies that are spread among a large number of insurers, however, the top three insurers represents approximately 14%, 6% and 5% of such balances. FIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada consistently monitor carrier ratings and financial performance of our carriers. While FIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada can mitigate its risks as a result of this monitoring to the extent that commercial or life insurance providers experience widespread difficulties or credit downgrades, the value of our collateral will be reduced. FIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada are also subject to the possibility of insolvency of insurance carriers in the commercial and life insurance businesses that are in possession of our collateral. If one or more large nationwide insurers were to fail, the value of our portfolio could be significantly negatively impacted. A significant downgrade in the value of the collateral supporting our premium finance\nbusiness could impair our ability to create liquidity for this business, which, in turn could negatively impact our ability to expand.\nOur wealth management business in general, and Wintrust Investments\u2019 brokerage operation, in particular, exposes us to certain risks associated with the securities industry.\nOur wealth management business in general, and Wintrust Investments' brokerage operations in particular, present special risks not borne by community banks that focus exclusively on community banking. For example, the brokerage industry is subject to fluctuations in the stock market that may have a significant adverse impact on transaction fees, customer activity and investment portfolio gains and losses. Likewise, additional or modified regulations may adversely affect our wealth management operations. Each of our wealth management operations is dependent on a small number of professionals whose departure could result in the loss of a significant number of customer accounts. A significant decline in fees and commissions or trading losses suffered in the investment portfolio could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to claim arbitration risk arising from customers who claim their investments were not suitable or that their portfolios were inappropriately traded. These risks increase when the market, as a whole, declines. The risks associated with retail brokerage may not be supported by the income generated by our wealth management operations.\nRisks Related to Financial Strength and Liquidity\nChanges in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income, which is our largest source of income.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in our core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since changes in prevailing interest rates affect the value of our assets and liabilities. Such changes may adversely affect our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Our net interest income is affected by the fact that assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. Net interest income represents our largest component of net income, and was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEach of our businesses may be affected differently by a given change in interest rates. For example, we expect that the results of our mortgage banking business in selling loans into the secondary market could be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates, whereas falling interest rates could have a negative impact on the net interest spread earned on deposits as we would be unable to lower the rates on many interest bearing deposit accounts of our customers to the same extent as many of our higher yielding asset classes.\nAdditionally, increases in interest rates may adversely influence the growth rate of loans and deposits, the quality of our loan portfolio, loan and deposit pricing, the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business and the value that we can recognize on the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market.\nIn response to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. While interest rates remain low, the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates during 2022. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.\nWe seek to mitigate our interest rate risk through several strategies, which may not be successful. With the relatively low interest rates that prevailed in recent years, we were able to augment the total return of our investment securities portfolio by selling call options on fixed-income securities that we own. We recorded fee income of approximately $3.7 million, $2.3 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative contracts from time to time with counterparties. To the extent that the market value of any derivative contract moves to a negative market value, we are subject to loss if the counterparty defaults. In the future, there can be no assurance that such mitigation strategies will be available or successful or that we will be successful in implementing any new mitigation strategies necessary to address the current rising interest rate environment. In addition, transactions entered into as part of mitigation strategies employed to mitigate risks associated with a prolonged low interest rate environment could be less beneficial or result in losses if interest rates continue to rise.\nOur liquidity position may be negatively impacted if economic conditions do not improve or if they decline.\nLiquidity is a measure of whether our cash flows and liquid assets are sufficient to satisfy current and future financial obligations, such as demand for loans, deposit withdrawals and operating costs. Our liquidity position is affected by a number of factors, including the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand, payment of interest and dividends on debt and equity\ninstruments that we have issued, capital we inject into our bank subsidiaries, proceeds we raise through the issuance of securities, our ability to draw upon our revolving credit facility and dividends received from our banking subsidiaries. Our future liquidity position may be adversely affected by multiple factors, including:\n\u2022if our banking subsidiaries report net losses or their earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs;\n\u2022if it is necessary for us to make capital injections to our banking subsidiaries;\n\u2022if changes in regulations require us to maintain a greater level of capital, as more fully described below;\n\u2022if we are unable to access our revolving credit facility due to a failure to satisfy financial and other covenants; or\n\u2022if we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are satisfactory to us.\nWeakness or worsening of the economy, real estate markets or unemployment levels may increase the likelihood that one or more of these events will occur. If our liquidity is adversely affected, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength may cause others to reduce or cease doing business with us, which could result in a decrease in our net interest income and fee revenues.\nOur customers rely upon our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, including due to market or regulatory developments, announced or rumored business developments or results of operations, or a decline in stock price, customers may withdraw their deposits or otherwise seek services from other banking institutions and prospective customers may select other service providers. The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is increased in the current market environment, where the consolidation of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, is resulting in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. As our community banks become more closely identified with the Wintrust name, the impact of any perceived weakness or creditworthiness at either the holding company or our community banks may be greater than in prior periods. If customers reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services that we provide them, net interest income and fee revenues will decrease accordingly, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our credit rating is lowered, our financing costs could increase.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have been rated by Fitch Ratings as \"BBB+\" and DBRS as \"A (low)\". A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.\nOur creditworthiness is not fixed and should be expected to change over time as a result of company performance and industry conditions. We cannot give any assurances that our credit ratings will remain at current levels, and it is possible that our ratings could be lowered or withdrawn by Fitch Ratings or DBRS. Any actual or threatened downgrade or withdrawal of our credit rating could affect our perception in the marketplace and our ability to raise capital, and could increase our debt financing costs.\nIf our growth requires us to raise additional capital, that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations (see \u201c - Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment - If we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios, we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets\u201d) and as we grow, internally and through acquisitions, the amount of capital required to support our operations grows as well. We may need to raise additional capital to support continued growth both internally and through acquisitions. Any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside our control and on our financial condition and performance. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or on terms acceptable to us, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and negatively affected.\nDisruption in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities portfolio.\nThe Company's available-for-sale debt and trading securities as well as certain equity securities are carried at fair value.\nAccounting standards require the Company to categorize these securities according to a fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 96% of the Company's available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value were categorized in level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy (meaning that their fair values were determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, quoted prices for similar assets or other observable inputs). Significant prolonged reduced investor demand could manifest itself in lower fair values for these securities and may result in recognition of an other-than-temporary or permanent impairment of available-for-sale debt securities and unrealized losses of equity securities with a readily determinable fair value recognized in earnings, which could lead to accounting charges and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe remaining securities in our available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value portfolios were categorized as level 3 (meaning that their fair values were determined by inputs that are unobservable in the market and therefore require a greater degree of management judgment). The determination of fair value for securities categorized in level 3 involves significant judgment due to the complexity of factors contributing to the valuation, many of which are not readily observable in the market. In addition, the nature of the business of the third party source that is valuing the securities at any given time could impact the valuation of the securities. Consequently, the ultimate sales price for any of these securities could vary significantly from the recorded fair value at December 31, 2021, especially if the security is sold during a period of illiquidity or market disruption or as part of a large block of securities under a forced transaction.\nThere can be no assurance that decline in market value of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value associated with these disruptions will not result in credit or permanent impairments, and unrealized losses, respectively, of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a bank holding company, and our sources of funds, including to pay dividends, are limited.\nWe are a bank holding company and our operations are primarily conducted by and through our 15 operating banks, which are subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders, repurchase our shares or repay our indebtedness is derived primarily from dividends received from our banks and our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries is restricted. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our banks can pay to us without regulatory approval. The banks may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of their capital below that necessary to meet the \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements. It is also possible that, depending upon the financial condition of the banks and other factors, regulatory authorities could conclude that payment of dividends or other payments, including payments to us, is an unsafe or unsound practice and impose restrictions or prohibit such payments. Our inability to receive dividends from our banks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nWe have derivative contracts, borrowings, variable rate loans and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on the LIBOR. Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks. The publication of most LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021. While certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to be published until June 30, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years. These reforms may cause such rates to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), has selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. Further, the Bank of England has commenced publication of a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average (\u201creformed SONIA\u201d), comprised of a broader set of overnight Sterling money market transactions, as of April 23, 2018. Reformed SONIA has been recommended as the alternative to Sterling LIBOR by the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates.\nAlthough SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S dollar LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the United States. We cannot predict what effect any such alternatives will have on the value of LIBOR-based securities or financial arrangements, including the Company\u2019s Series D Preferred Stock, junior subordinated debentures or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and other interest rates. In the event that a published LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the dividend rate on the Company\u2019s Series D Preferred Stock, which currently is based on the LIBOR rate, will be determined as set forth in the accompanying offering documents, and the value of such securities may be adversely affected.\nWe anticipate significant operational challenges for the transition away from LIBOR including, but not limited to, amending existing loan agreements with borrowers on loans that may have not been modified with fallback language and adding effective fallback language to new agreements in the event that LIBOR is discontinued before maturity. In addition, the transition away from LIBOR could prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Company\u2019s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, as well as result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities. Currently, the manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan, derivative and investment portfolios, asset-liability management and business, is uncertain.\nRisks Related to General Operations\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts. In addition, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion and data corruption attempts, in addition to the resulting identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, personal, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.\nWe, our customers, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damage to our systems or other material disruption of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and \"spear phishing\" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and may not be recognized until launched or until well after a breach has occurred. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business.\nCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful\npenetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our or our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, remediation costs, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur vendors may be responsible for failures that adversely affect our operations.\nWe use and rely upon many external vendors to provide us with day-to-day products and services essential to our operations. We are thus exposed to risk that such vendors will not perform as contracted or at agreed-upon service levels. The failure of our vendors to perform as contracted or at necessary service levels for any reason could disrupt our operations, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, if any of our vendors experience insolvency or other business failure, such failure could affect our ability to obtain necessary products or services from a substitute vendor in a timely and cost-effective manner or prevent us from effectively pursuing certain business objectives entirely. Our failure to implement business objectives due to vendor nonperformance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe issue debit cards, and debit card transactions pose a particular cybersecurity risk that is outside of our control.\nDebit card numbers are susceptible to theft at the point of sale via the physical terminal through which transactions are processed and by other means of hacking. The security and integrity of these transactions are dependent upon retailers\u2019 vigilance and willingness to invest in technology and upgrades. Despite third-party security risks that are beyond our control, we offer our customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit cards in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. Offering such protection to our customers exposes us to potential losses which, in the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information we receive about our customers and counterparties to make credit decisions.\nWe rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions. This information could include financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, our ability to provide high quality service will be diminished, we may lose key customer relationships, and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management and other key personnel. Our business model is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality and personal service. In addition, as a holding company that conducts its operations through our subsidiaries, we are focused on providing entrepreneurial-based compensation to the chief executives of each our business units. As a Company with start-up and growth oriented operations, we are cognizant that to attract and retain the managerial talent necessary to operate and grow our businesses we often have to compensate our executives with a view to the business we expect them to manage, rather than the size of the business they currently manage. Accordingly, any executive compensation restrictions may negatively impact our ability to retain and attract senior management. The departure of a senior manager or other key personnel may damage relationships with certain customers, or certain customers may choose to follow such personnel to a competitor. The loss of any of our senior managers or other key personnel, or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses incurred in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market may exceed our financial statement reserves and we may be required to increase such reserves in the future. Increases to our reserves and losses incurred in connection with actual loan repurchases and indemnification payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe engage in the origination and purchase of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market. In connection with such sales, we make certain representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. We receive requests for loan repurchases and indemnification payments relating to the representations and warranties with respect to such loans. We have been able to reach settlements with a number of purchasers, and believe that we have established appropriate reserves with respect to indemnification requests. It is possible that the number of such requests will increase or that we will not be able to reach settlements with respect to such requests in the future. Accordingly, it is possible that losses incurred in connection with loan repurchases and indemnification payments may be in excess of our financial statement reserves, and we may be required to increase such reserves and may sustain additional losses associated with such loan repurchases and indemnification payments in the future. Increases to our reserves and losses incurred by us in connection with actual loan repurchases and indemnification payments in excess of our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as acts of war, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and public health threats.\nAn act of war, terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, a major epidemic or pandemic, natural disaster, or the threat of such an event or other public health threat, could adversely affect our customers and our business. Such events could significantly impact the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the value of the collateral securing loans, adversely impact our employee base, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and cause us to incur additional expenses. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws and Illinois law may have the effect of impeding the acquisition of control of Wintrust by means of a tender offer, a proxy fight, open-market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our board of directors. For example, our board of directors may issue additional authorized shares of our capital stock to deter future attempts to gain control of Wintrust, including the authority to determine the terms of any one or more series of preferred stock, such as voting rights, conversion rates and liquidation preferences. As a result of the ability to fix voting rights for a series of preferred stock, the board has the power, to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duty, to issue a series of preferred stock to persons friendly to management in order to attempt to block a merger or other transaction by which a third party seeks control, and thereby assist the incumbent board of directors and management to retain their respective positions. In addition, our articles of incorporation expressly elect to be governed by the provisions of Section 7.85 of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors.\nThe ability of a third party to acquire us is also limited under applicable banking regulations. The BHC Act requires any \u201cbank holding company\u201d (as defined in the BHC Act) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire 10% or more of our outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978. Any holder of 25% or more of our outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a \u201cbank holding company\u201d under the BHC Act. For purposes of calculating ownership thresholds under these banking regulations, bank regulators would generally take the position that the maximum number of shares of Wintrust common stock that a holder is entitled to receive pursuant to securities convertible into or settled in Wintrust common stock, including pursuant to any warrants to purchase Wintrust common stock held by such holder, must be taken into account in calculating a shareholder's aggregate holdings of Wintrust common stock.\nThese provisions may have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but which our individual shareholders may deem to be in their best interests or in which our shareholders may receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices. As a result, shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. Such provisions will also render the removal of our current board of directors or management more difficult.", "PERMNO": 84636, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WTFC"}
