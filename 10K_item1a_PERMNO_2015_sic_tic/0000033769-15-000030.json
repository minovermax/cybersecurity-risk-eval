{"cik": "33769", "company": "BOB EVANS FARMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe risk factors presented below may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial position and cash flows. The categories listed below are for information purposes only and do not signify that any risk should or should not be included in one or more of the other categories, or that any category or risk is more significant than any other risk. In addition to the risk factors presented below, changes in general economic conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary\nspending patterns, demographic trends and consumer confidence in the economy, which affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and retail purchases in general, may have a material adverse effect on us. Our actual results could vary significantly from any results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:\nI. STRATEGIC\nOur failure to achieve and maintain positive average unit store growth for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSame-store sales are a key measure of the financial health of our company, as well as our individual restaurants. Same-store sales growth may be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits;\n\u2022gasoline prices;\n\u2022customer trends;\n\u2022intense competition in the restaurant business;\n\u2022customer satisfaction;\n\u2022extraordinary events such as weather or natural disasters; and\n\u2022pricing pressure.\nWe depend on consumer acceptance of our menu offerings, food products, prices, atmosphere, convenience and service procedures.\nOur success in creating demand for our brand as well as our restaurant menu offerings and food products is dependent on our ability to continue to accurately predict consumer dining and taste preferences and adapt our menu and food products to trends in food consumption. Our success is also dependent upon our ability to provide outstanding customer service and convenience and to keep the atmosphere of our Bob Evans Restaurants segment differentiated from our competitors, and relevant and appealing to our customers. If we change our restaurant concept or customer service technique, we may lose customers who do not prefer the changed concept or customer service technique, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the concept or technique profitable.\nWe depend on initiatives designed to improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations, as well as increase revenues, and failure to fully achieve or sustain these initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have had, and expect to continue to have, initiatives related to cost efficiencies and revenue generation in various stages of testing, evaluation and implementation, upon which we expect to rely on to improve our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain in their application to our business in general, even when tested successfully on a more limited scale. It is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation. Testing and general implementation also can be affected by other risk factors described herein that reduce the results expected. Successful system-wide implementation of these initiatives across hundreds of restaurants and involving tens of thousands of employees relies on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of execution, changes in market conditions and the absence of offsetting factors that can adversely influence results. Failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur long-term growth strategy depends on successfully executing our current strategic efforts to turnaround our business results. Our ability to complete our turnaround efforts is influenced by factors beyond our control, which may slow our turnaround efforts and impair our long-term growth\nWe are pursuing a disciplined long-term growth strategy which, to be successful, will depend in large part on our ability to execute our current turnaround efforts. If we are unable to execute the turnaround efforts due to factors beyond our control our long-term growth opportunities could be impaired.\nWe are authorized to pursue certain strategic transactions, including one or more sale-leasebacks of our New Albany, Ohio headquarters, our BEF Foods manufacturing facilities in Lima, Ohio, and Sulphur Springs, Texas. The Company cannot guarantee that any of these transactions will occur. The decision to enter into any of these transactions, or the assets subject to\na transaction, depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates and general U.S economic conditions, the performance of the Bob Evan\u2019s business segments, etc., and must first be approved by the Board of Directors. Any transaction would be subject to the normal conditions and covenants for closing. Depending upon the size and structure of any of these transactions, prior to entering into a transaction, the Company could be required to either obtain permission from its credit facility lenders or put in place alternative financing arrangements. The failure to successfully implement on one or more of these strategic transactions within the time period planned could have a material adverse effect on our long-term growth strategy to turn around the business as well as on our results of operations. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the execution of one or more such transactions will have a positive impact on our long-term growth strategy or results of operations.\nWe may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing of existing restaurants. We incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close existing restaurants. The expenses of opening or closing any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur restaurant business is dependent upon satisfactory customer service, and we may have difficulty hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to deliver appropriate service.\nOur restaurant business depends in significant part upon our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including Above Restaurant Leaders, restaurant managers, kitchen staff and servers who can meet the high standards necessary to deliver the levels of food quality and service on which our restaurant segment is based upon. The short supply of qualified individuals in some areas could strain our restaurant operations, delay new restaurant openings or require us to increase wages to attract desired individuals, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Also, high rates of employee turnover could have a negative impact on food quality, recruiting and training costs, and customer service, which would result in an adverse effect on our restaurant business and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to compete effectively in the restaurant and food products industries.\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive and is affected by changes in the public\u2019s eating habits and preferences, population trends, traffic patterns and weather conditions, as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits, many of which are beyond our control. Key competitive factors in the restaurant industry include the quality and value of the menu items offered, food preparation and consistency of the preparation from restaurant to restaurant, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, advertising, name brand awareness and image and restaurant locations. Many of our competitors are well-established national, regional or local chains, and some have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have, which may give them competitive advantages. We compete with many restaurant operators and other retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees. We also compete with grocery store chains that offer cooked and prepared products for the consumer. We expect competition to intensify as our competitors expand operations in our markets and quick-service restaurant chains expand their breakfast offerings. This increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nThe food products industry is also highly competitive and is affected by changes in the public\u2019s eating habits and preferences, as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits. Key competitive factors in the industry include the quality, flavor and value of the food products offered, advertising and name brand awareness. Our competitors include well-established national, regional and local producers and wholesalers of similar products, many of whom have substantially greater name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources than we have, which may give them competitive advantages. We are facing increased competition from private label sausage products and side dishes. We expect competition to intensify in our BEF Foods segment as other food companies introduce refrigerated side dishes to compete with our successful products. This increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur marketing and branding strategies may not be successful, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur marketing and branding strategies continue to evolve to maximize our appeal to customers and compete effectively. We do not have any assurance that our marketing strategies will be successful. If our current strategy to aggressively use less discounting, new advertising, modified branding, and other marketing programs are not successful, we may not generate the level of restaurant and food products sales we expect and the expenses associated with these programs will negatively affect our financial results. Moreover, many of our competitors have successfully used national marketing strategies, including network and cable television advertising in the past, and we may not be able to successfully compete against those established programs.\nThe growth of our BEF Foods segment\u2019s sales and profits is dependent upon our ability to expand into existing and new markets.\nThe successful growth of our BEF Foods segment depends in part on our ability to add new retail customers, as well as expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers by expanding the number of our items they offer for sale and product placement within the refrigerated meat and the frozen products departments. The expansion of the BEF Foods business segment depends on our ability to obtain and retain large-account customers, such as grocery store chains and warehouse customers. Our failure to obtain and retain new large-account customers or maintain our relationships with existing large-account customers could have a material adverse effect on the BEF Foods segments\u2019 business and results of operations.\nThe financial performance and results of operations of the BEF Foods segment could be adversely affected by availability of and price we pay for sows and pork trimmings.\nSows are the most important raw material used to produce our pork sausage products in our BEF Foods segment. We procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in many states and Canada. The live sow market is highly volatile in terms of the number of sows available and the current market price. The live sow market is dependent upon supply and demand for pork products, as well as corn and soybean meal prices (the major food supply for sows), weather and farmers\u2019 access to capital. We also use pork trimmings and the pork trimmings market is also highly volatile in terms of availability and the current market price.\nHigher sow and pork trimmings costs could adversely affect the BEF Foods segment\u2019s profitability, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along any portion of the increased costs to our consumers in a timely manner or at all.\nOur BEF Foods segment\u2019s business is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for the production of a significant number of items and relies upon a relatively small number of customers for a large percentage of its sales.\nOur BEF Foods segment\u2019s business is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers, and we have not always identified secondary suppliers for food products manufactured in our plants, or secondary suppliers with sufficient capacity. Our prolonged inability to provide products to fill orders in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on both our Bob Evans Restaurants and the BEF Foods segments\u2019 businesses and our results of operations. Our BEF Foods segment\u2019s business also relies upon a relatively small number of customers for a large percentage of its sales. Our inability to maintain strong relationships with our key customers and meet their requests could result in a loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our BEF Foods business and our results of operations.\nOur actual operating and financial results in any given period may differ from guidance we provide to the public, including our most recent public guidance.\nFrom time to time, in press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls and other contexts, we have provided guidance to the public regarding current business conditions and our expectations for our future financial results. We expect that we will provide guidance periodically in the future. Our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions, expectations and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In providing our guidance, we also make various assumptions with respect to our future business decisions, some of which will change. Our actual financial results, therefore, may vary from our guidance due to our inability to meet the assumptions upon which our guidance is based and the impact on our business of the various risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors and in our public filings with the SEC. Variances between our actual results and our guidance may be material. To the extent that our actual financial results do not meet or exceed our guidance, the trading prices of our securities may be materially adversely affected.\nBecause many of our restaurants are concentrated in certain geographic areas, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations by regional economic conditions, severe weather and other events.\nThe concentration of many of our existing and planned restaurants in particular regions of the United States could affect our operating results in a number of ways. For example, our results of operations may be adversely affected by economic conditions in that region, the local labor market and regional competition. Also, adverse publicity relating to our restaurants in a region in which they are concentrated could have a more pronounced adverse effect on our overall revenue than might be the case if our restaurants were more broadly dispersed.\nA majority of our Bob Evans Restaurants are located in Ohio and other parts of the Midwest, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic conditions, natural disasters, severe weather and other events in this region. Our business is subject to seasonal adverse weather conditions (especially between October and March) that may at times affect regions in which our restaurants are located, regions that produce raw ingredients for our restaurants, or locations of our distribution network. As a result our quarterly and yearly results have varied in the past, and we believe that our quarterly operating results will vary in the future. In addition, adverse weather conditions could cause us to experience closures, repair and restoration costs, food spoilage, and other significant reopening costs as well as increased food costs and delayed supply shipments, any of which would adversely affect our business. Additionally, during periods of extreme temperatures (either hot or cold) or precipitation, many individuals choose to stay indoors. This impacts transaction counts in our restaurants and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to align our corporate culture to adapt to evolving business changes and requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur results may be adversely affected if we are unable to execute on the key elements of our strategic plan to improve our sales, general and administrative cost structure, delivery execution, and resource utilization. Effecting significant reductions in cost structure, as well as changes in operational regimes and corporate culture is a significant challenge. If we are unable to change and instill within our entire organization the appropriate cost cutting and operational regimes of our corporate culture, we may not be able to gain the required cost savings and improvements and increase our profitability. If we are unable to successfully execute any or all of the initiatives of our strategic plan, our revenues, operating results and profitability may be adversely affected.\nII. OPERATIONS\nOur business could suffer if we are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food-related contaminations or illnesses.\nAs a business with a restaurant segment and a food production segment, we can be adversely affected by complaints or litigation from consumers alleging illness, injury or other food quality, adverse health effects (including obesity) or operational concerns. Our reputation and business can also be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from such complaints or litigation. Food-related contaminations and illnesses may be caused by a variety of food-borne pathogens, such as e-coli or salmonella, from a variety of illnesses transmitted by restaurant workers, such as hepatitis A, and from contamination of food by foreign substances. Contamination and food-borne illness incidents could also be caused by food suppliers and distributors. As a result, we cannot control all of the potential sources of contamination or illness that can be contained in or transmitted from food. If any person becomes injured or ill, or alleges becoming injured or ill, as a result of eating our food, we may temporarily close some restaurants or a BEF Foods segment plant, which would decrease our revenues, and we may be liable for damages, be subject to governmental regulatory action and/or receive adverse publicity, regardless of whether we are at fault, any of which could have long-lasting, negative effects on our reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nUnfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales.\nThe good reputation of our restaurant and foods brands is a key factor in the success of our business. Actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants or plants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands. Given the extensive use of the Internet and various forms of social networking websites, as well as our own website, unfavorable publicity can spread world-wide in only hours. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or plants, or only to a single restaurant or plant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. Negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products, environmental disasters, crime incidents, data privacy breaches, scandals involving our employees, or operational problems at our restaurants or plants, all of which could make our brands less appealing to our guests and customers, and negatively impact our guest counts and sales.\nAdverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are a highly automated business and rely on our production facilities, our network infrastructure, the Internet, our website and mobile apps for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales (including online ordering) activities. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data.\nMany of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Ohio location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nOur BEF Foods segment operates four manufacturing plants. If we were forced to close or delay production at one or more of these plants due to a natural disaster or significant labor issue, we may be unable to increase production at our other plants with our co-packers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on information technology and any material failure, interruption, or security breach in our systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for the order and delivery from distributors, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, gift and loyalty cards, online business, and various other processes and transactions, including the storage of employee and customer information. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems to process these transactions, summarize results and manage and report on our business. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem. Additionally, if a person is able to circumvent the security measures intended to protect our employee or customer private data, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations, which could significantly harm our reputation or result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.\nIn addition, our ability to accept credit cards as payment in our restaurants and for online gift card orders depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council. These standards require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers\u2019 credit card and other personal information. We employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing to reduce the likelihood of any security failures or breaches. However, we can provide no assurance that these security measures will be successful. If these security measures are not successful, we may become subject to litigation against us or the imposition of regulatory penalties, which could result in negative publicity and significantly harm our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur inability to improve our systems in fiscal 2016 to provide greater access for customers, increase operational capabilities, and to replace our core enterprise resource planning systems could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOperational excellence and the continued improvement of our customer experience are among our highest priorities. As a result, we made increased investments during fiscal 2015 and expect to continue to make investments during fiscal 2016 in our technology infrastructure, and the labor necessary to support this technology, in areas designed to more effectively collect and process our enterprise information and data for resource planning, as well as positively impacting the way in which our customers interact with us, including through the ordering process, food production and finally through the delivery of food to the customer. Our inability to effectively implement our core enterprise resource planning systems' replacement, as well as the other changes to our technology infrastructure could negatively impact our operations and processes and could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIf we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers and employees. Competition for high-quality employees is intense. The loss of the services from our key management personnel or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could harm our business.\nOur restaurant and food products businesses are dependent on timely delivery of fresh ingredients by our suppliers and distributors.\nOur restaurant operations and food products business are dependent on timely deliveries of fresh ingredients, including fresh produce, dairy products and meat. The cost, availability and quality of the ingredients we use to prepare our food are subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Fluctuations in weather, supply and demand, the economy and political conditions could adversely affect the cost, availability and quality of our ingredients. If the variety or quality of the food we offer declines due to the lack or lower quality of our ingredients or due to interruptions in the flow of fresh ingredients, customer traffic or food product orders may decline and negatively affect our sales. We have contracted with one primary and other third-party distributors for the delivery of food and other products to our restaurants. If our primary distributor or these contracts were suddenly and unexpectedly terminated, supply costs could increase and disruptions in distribution could occur during the transition to other third-party distributors which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur inability to successfully and sufficiently raise menu and food products prices to offset increased costs could result in a decline in margins.\nWe utilize price increases for menu offerings and food products to help offset cost increases, including increased costs for wholesale food, raw materials, distribution, minimum wages, employee benefits, construction, fuel, utility, and other costs. During fiscal 2015, we implemented menu price increases at Bob Evans Restaurants to help offset operating and supply cost increases. Additionally we expect shell and liquid egg prices to increase in fiscal 2016, a result of the avian influenza that has significantly impacted poultry farms in the Midwest. We may not be able to pass through these additional costs to customers in the form of increased pricing.\nFurther federal legislation to increase the minimum wage as well as the tip credit wage we pay to certain staff members receiving guest gratuities is possible, and there may be similar increases implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and prices to sufficiently account for increased costs, especially further minimum wage increases at the federal and/or state level. Also, because we offer moderately priced food, we may not be able to, or we may choose not to, pass along price increases to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe outsource certain business processes and product manufacturing to third-party vendors that subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nSome of our business processes and the manufacturing of certain products are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include distribution of food and retail products to our restaurant locations, manufacturing of certain products, credit card authorization and processing, gift card tracking and authorization, health care and workers\u2019 compensation insurance claims processing and externally hosted systems and business software applications. We cannot ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities, and there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIII. COMPLIANCE\nThe restaurant and food products industries are heavily regulated, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be more costly than we expect.\nThe restaurant industry and the food products industry are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"PPACA\"), the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and applicable requirements concerning minimum wage, overtime, health care coverage, family leave, medical privacy, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. Compliance with these legal requirements may be more costly than we expect. The failure to obtain and/or retain licenses, permits or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a restaurant and/or the continued operation of a particular restaurant or food products manufacturing facility. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations\ncould also result in fines or legal actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Significant legal and regulatory issues affecting our business include:\n\u2022\nemployment laws, including minimum wage requirements, overtime pay requirements and exemptions, meal and rest break requirements, paid \u201csick days\u201d or other paid time off, unemployment tax rates, discrimination laws, workers\u2019 compensation rates and citizenship and immigration requirements;\n\u2022\nnational health care reform legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in March 2010 and its provisions will require nutritional information labeling on restaurant menus, menu boards, and drive-through displays;\n\u2022\npermit, licensing and other regulatory requirements for the sale of food and beverages;\n\u2022\nhealth, safety and fire regulations;\n\u2022\nzoning, land and environmental regulations;\n\u2022\na variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials;\n\u2022\nsales tax;\n\u2022\nnew and changing laws and regulations relating to gift cards;\n\u2022\nfood safety regulations governing the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States and Canada; and\n\u2022\nlaws governing public access and employment for people with disabilities.\nIn March 2010, the President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, \u201cHealth Care Reform Acts\u201d). Although we developed business processes to deal with and mitigate the costs associated with the Health Care Reform Acts, which may result in significant modifications to our employment and benefits policies and practices, we incurred significant increases in the cost and may incur further increases and are unable to predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have on us. We do expect that our expenses will increase as a result of the Health Care Reform Acts. Any such increases could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, such modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.\nHealth concerns and government regulations relating to the consumption of trans-fats, pork, beef, chicken and other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nConsumer food preferences could be affected by health concerns regarding the consumption of various types of food, such as trans-fats, pork, beef or chicken. While we have eliminated all artificial and synthetic trans-fats from our restaurant menu offerings and our food products, some foods, such as bacon, naturally contain trans-fats. Some government authorities have proposed increasing regulations regarding naturally occurring trans-fats and sodium. These regulations could, if adopted, require us to limit naturally occurring trans-fats or sodium amounts in our menu offerings and/or food products in the future. This could require us to switch to higher cost ingredients, stop offering certain products, or could hinder our ability to operate in certain markets.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we are the subject of increased litigation regarding personal injuries suffered on our premises, discrimination, harassment or other labor matters.\nEmployee and customer claims against us based on, among other things, personal injury, discrimination, harassment, wage and hour disputes or wrongful termination may divert our financial and management resources from operating our businesses. Restaurant companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging, among other things, violation of federal and state law. Like many employers, we have been faced with allegations of purported class-wide labor violations in Ohio, and we have taken charges related to the settlement of these cases. An unfavorable verdict or a significant settlement in a future class-action lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock. In the past we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, however we concluded that those material weaknesses were remediated as of April 24, 2015. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary in the future for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.\nIn addition, we implemented the first phase of our enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d), on April 25, 2015. Any impact from implementation issues we experience or delays in the implementation of future phases of this system could cause disruption of our internal control over financial reporting and cause delays in our ability to adequately assess our internal control over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting or comply with the federal securities rules and regulations applicable to us, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and our SEC reporting obligations related to our internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis may be adversely affected, we may be unable to obtain an unqualified audit opinion, and our access to the capital markets may be restricted. In addition, we may, in the future, identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. Each of the foregoing could impact the reliability and timeliness of our financial reports and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our business and the value of our securities.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\"AICPA\") and other accounting standard-setting bodies may periodically issue changes to, interpretations of or guidance with respect to GAAP. The adoption of such guidance may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nIV. OTHER\nA privacy or security breach of our Company and customer data could adversely affect our business.\nThe protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. For example, in connection with credit and debit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a significant breach of customer, employee or company data, we could be exposed to risks of data loss, fines, a loss of the ability to process credit and debit card payments, litigation and serious disruption of our operations. Additionally, any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations and third party contracts regarding the collection, maintenance, privacy and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nWe collect, maintain and process certain information about customers and employees, much of which is considered private or confidential. Our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations, as well as by\nthird party contracts. If our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, resulting in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increased fees payable to third parties, and penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a variety of other factors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in food and commodity prices, including sow costs;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses;\n\u2022\ncosts related to the closing of existing restaurants, which may include impairment charges and lease termination expenses;\n\u2022\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u2022\nprofitability of our restaurants;\n\u2022\nimpairments of long-term assets;\n\u2022\ntrends in same-store sales;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, especially during peak winter holiday sales seasons;\n\u2022\nspecial items, such as property purchases or sales;\n\u2022\nclass action or litigation settlements;\n\u2022\nlocal and national economic conditions, including gasoline and other energy costs; and\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions.\nOur Bob Evans Restaurants and our BEF Foods business segments are also subject to seasonal fluctuations. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results, same-store sales and comparable food products sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any fiscal year. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to the factors discussed above, this could result in a decline in our stock price.\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading price of our stock.\nFactors such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report relates directly to our business, could have an impact on the trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may also be affected by stock market conditions, including price and trading fluctuations on the NASDAQ Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange or other exchanges. In addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our common stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders, as well as nonoperating initiatives such as share repurchase programs. Any failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance, particularly with respect to comparable restaurant sales, revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for general corporate purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins. These events have also adversely affected the U.S. and world economy, and any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the U.S. and world economy, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurances that various U.S. and world government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets in the near future will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets, or increase liquidity or the availability of credit. There can be no assurances as to how or when this unprecedented period of turmoil will be resolved.\nCovenants in our debt instruments could restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely affect us.\nOur credit facility contains various covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to incur liens on our assets; merge or consolidate with other entities; transfer or sell a substantial part of our assets; substantially change the nature of our business; pay dividends or initiate stock repurchases under certain circumstances; and enter into transactions with affiliates, among other restrictions. The covenants contained in our credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other corporate opportunities, to fund our business operations or to successfully implement our current and future operating strategies. The credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants. At April 24, 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, any failure to maintain these financial covenants or have sufficient liquidity to either repay or refinance the then outstanding balance upon violation of the covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition if we were unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our bank group or access alternative sources of capital.\nA breach of a covenant in our debt instruments could cause acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nA breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and, due to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, could result in a default under our other agreements. In addition, the agreements governing our credit facility require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control (such as uncertainties related to the current economy), and we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply with these covenants at all times in the future. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt instruments, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders under our current or future indebtedness accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot be sure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to continue to pay dividends or repurchase our stock as expected by the market, our earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) and stock price may be harmed.\nOur dividend and stock repurchase programs require the use of a significant portion of our cash flow or may exceed our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and our capacity to borrow funds, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure to pay dividends or repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact investor confidence in us, thereby negatively impacting our EPS and stock price.\nOur failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.\nWe believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. Our primary trademarks, \u201cBob Evans,\u201d \"Bob Evans Restaurants\" and \u201cOwens,\u201d are key components of our operating and marketing strategies. As a result, we devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. The protective actions that we take, however, may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, could cause us to incur significant legal costs.\nIn addition, third parties might claim that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the provisions of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated January 28, 2013, pursuant to which the sale of the Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 restaurant chain was sold, we may incur expenses for liabilities we retained and indemnification we provided to the buyer, and we may not receive all or part of the purchase price evidenced by the $30.0 million promissory note from the buyer.\nAs part of the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated January 28, 2013, pursuant to which we sold the Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 restaurant chain, we retained certain liabilities for the presale operations of the Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 restaurant chain, including potential claims and most existing litigation, as well as agreeing to indemnify the buyer against the costs of the same. As a result, we are likely to incur expenses for such claims and liabilities related to periods up to the date of sale.\nPart of the consideration we received in the transaction was a promissory note, (the \"Note\") which has a principal balance of $30.0 million, an annual interest rate of 1.5%, a term of seven years and a principal and interest payment date of February, 2020. Partial prepayments are required prior to maturity if the buyer reaches certain levels of EBITDA during specified periods. Our right to repayment under the Note is subordinated to third party lenders as well as funding that may be provided by the parent company. In the event of a sale or liquidation of Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 by its parent company, our right to repayment may be subordinated to payments owed to the parent company and potentially reduced based on the funds available for repayment. Because the Note is subordinated under certain conditions, it is possible that the principal amount of the Note may not be paid in full or at all.\nOur current insurance loss estimates may not be adequate and, if claims exceed such estimates, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe are self-insured for a significant portion of our current exposures related to our workers\u2019 compensation, general, auto and property liabilities and employee health insurance programs. Although we base our loss estimates on actuarial data, as well as on our historical trends, we may not be able to accurately predict the number or value of the claims that occur. In particular, health insurance costs have increased significantly over the last 10 years. In the event that our actual liability exceeds our estimate for any given period, or if we are unable to control rapidly increasing health care costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our level of profitability.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may have anti-takeover effects.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law applicable to us could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (as defined in the statute) for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met. In addition, our senior management is entitled to certain payments and rights upon a change in control of our Company, which could result in expenses that may deter a potential merger, tender offer or other acquisition of our Company.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy fight and the actions of activist shareholders.\nIn 2014 Castlerigg Global Equity Special Event Master Fund, Ltd., one of our stockholders affiliated with the Sandell Asset Management Corp. (together with its affiliates, \"Sandell\"), conducted a proxy contest with us and elected four individuals to our board of directors at our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders. If a proxy contest or other action by Sandell or another activist shareholder would occur in the future, our business could be adversely affected because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our board, management and employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our board of directors to pursue an activist shareholder's particular agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 18570, "SIC": 2013, "TIC": "BOBE"}
