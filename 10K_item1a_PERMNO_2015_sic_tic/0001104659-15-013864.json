{"cik": "1091862", "company": "Chemtura CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows include, but are not limited to, the factors described below. Except as otherwise indicated, these factors may or may not occur and we cannot predict the likelihood of any such factor occurring.\nThe cyclical nature of the chemicals industry causes significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply and demand balance of the chemicals industry. The chemicals industry has experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and supply, allowing prices and profit margins to increase, followed by periods when substantial capacity is added, resulting in oversupply, overcapacity, corresponding declining utilization rates and, ultimately, declining prices and profit margins. Some of the markets in which our customers participate, such as the automotive, electronics and building and construction industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us that is beyond our control. These markets are highly competitive, are driven to a large extent by end-use markets and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products and result in volatile operating results and cash flows over our business cycle. Future growth in product demand may not be sufficient to utilize current or future capacity. Excess industry capacity may continue to depress our volumes and margins on some products. Our operating results, accordingly, may be volatile as a result of excess industry capacity, as well as from rising energy and raw materials costs.\nIn addition, we may experience excess capacity with respect to the products we have agreed to supply to the purchaser of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business under the post-closing supply agreements. If such supply agreements are terminated at the end of their minimum contract terms and we are unable to find additional production to fill the vacated capacity, we may experience declining utilization rates, prices and profit margins, all of which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIncreases in the price of the raw materials or energy utilized for our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe purchase significant amounts of raw materials and energy for our businesses. The cost of these raw materials and energy, in the aggregate, represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The prices and availability of the raw materials we utilize vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. From time to time in the past, we have experienced significant cost increases in purchase of raw materials and energy which has had a negative impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we have attempted, and will continue to attempt, to match increases in the prices of raw materials or energy with corresponding increases in selling prices for the products produced with these materials, we may not be able to immediately raise product prices, if at all. Ultimately, our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials or energy to customers is highly dependent upon market conditions. Specifically, there is a risk that raising prices charged to our customers could result in a loss of sales volume. In the past, we have not always been able to pass on increases in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, in whole or in part, and there will likely be periods in the future when we will not be able to pass on these price increases. Reactions by our customers and competitors to our price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases, which would negatively affect operating results.\nAny disruption in the availability of the raw materials or energy utilized for our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAcross our businesses, there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and, in some cases, the number of sources for and availability of raw materials and utilities is specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located. It is also common in the chemical industries for a facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities, such as steam, electricity and gas. Having a sole or limited number of suppliers may result in our having limited negotiating power, particularly during times of rising raw material costs. Even where we have multiple suppliers for a raw material or utility, these suppliers may not make up for the loss of a major supplier. Moreover, any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements. For some of our products, the facilities or distribution channels of raw material and utility suppliers and our production facilities form an integrated system, which limits our ability to negotiate favorable terms in supply agreements.\nIn addition, as part of an increased trend towards vertical integration in the chemicals industry, other chemical companies are purchasing raw material suppliers. This is further reducing the available suppliers for certain raw materials.\nIf one or more of our significant raw material or utility suppliers were unable to meet its obligations under present supply arrangements, raw materials may become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced, or supplies may otherwise be constrained or disrupted, our businesses could be forced to incur increased costs for our raw materials or utilities, which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDecline in general economic conditions and other external factors may adversely impact our operations.\nExternal factors, including domestic and global economic conditions, international events and circumstances, competitor actions and government regulation, are beyond our control and can cause fluctuations in demand and volatility in the prices of raw materials and other costs that can intensify the impact of economic cycles on our operations. We produce a broad range of products that are used as additives and components in other products in a wide variety of end-use markets. As a result, our products may be negatively impacted by supply and demand instability in other industries and the effects of that instability on supply chain participants. Economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate may also adversely impact our operations. For example, some countries in Europe have been particularly adversely affected by rising government deficits and debt levels, which require certain countries to adopt deflationary fiscal and monetary policies that could negatively affect our businesses. Although our diversified product portfolio and international presence lessens our dependence on a single market and exposure to economic conditions or political instability in any one country or region, our businesses are nonetheless sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Accordingly, financial crises and economic downturns anywhere in the world could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompetition may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in many of the markets in which we operate due to the trend toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors. Some of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets to facilitate continued expansion or new product development. Additionally, some of our competitors have a greater product range and distributional capability than we do for certain products and in specific regions. We also expect that we will continue to face new competitive challenges as well as additional risks inherent in international operations in developing regions. We are susceptible to price competition in certain markets in which customers are sensitive to changes in price. At the same time, we also face downward pressure on prices from industry overcapacity and lower cost structures in certain businesses. The further use and introduction of generic and alternative products by our competitors may result in increased competition and could require us to reduce our prices and take other steps to compete effectively. These measures could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Alternatively, if we were to increase prices in response to this competition, the reactions of our competitors and customers to such price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases or risk a loss in sales volumes.\nOur inability to register our products in member states of the European Union under the REACh legislation may lead to some restrictions or cancellations of registrations, which could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products.\nIn December 2006, the European Union signed the REACh legislation. This legislation requires chemical manufacturers and importers in the European Union to demonstrate the safety of the chemical substances contained in their products via a substance registration process. The full REACh registration process is being phased in over the next several years. The registration process requires capital and resource commitments to compile and file comprehensive chemical dossiers regarding the use and attributes of each chemical substance manufactured or imported by Chemtura and requires us to perform chemical safety assessments. Successful registration under REACh is a functional prerequisite to the continued sale of our products in the European Union market. Thus, REACh presents a risk to the continued sale of our products in the European Union should we be unable or unwilling to complete the registration process or if the European Union seeks to ban or materially restrict the production or importation of the chemical substances used in our products.\nCurrent and future litigation, governmental investigations, prosecutions and administrative claims, including antitrust-related governmental investigations and lawsuits, could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have been involved in several significant lawsuits and claims relating to environmental and chemical exposure matters, and may in the future be involved in similar litigation. Additionally, we are routinely subject to other civil claims, litigation and arbitration and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of our business as well as with respect to our divested businesses. We could become subject to additional claims. An adverse outcome of these claims could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have also been involved in a number of governmental investigations, prosecutions and administrative claims in the past, including antitrust-related governmental investigations and civil lawsuits, and may in the future be subject to similar claims. Additionally, we have incurred and could again incur expenses in connection with antitrust-related matters, including expenses related to our cooperation with governmental authorities and defense-related civil lawsuits.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulation matters could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Our operations bear the risk of violations of those laws and sanctions for violations such as clean-up and removal costs, long-term monitoring and maintenance costs, costs of waste disposal, natural resource damages and payments for property damage and personal injury. Although it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements.\nAdditionally, these requirements, and enforcement of these requirements, may become more stringent in the future. The ultimate additional cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material. Non-compliance could subject us to material liabilities such as government fines or orders, criminal sanctions, third-party lawsuits, remediations and settlements, the suspension, modification or revocation of necessary permits and licenses, or the suspension of non-compliant operations. We may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost. Future regulatory or other developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of, or require us to make modifications to, our products, packaging, manufacturing processes and technology, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAt any given time, we may be involved in claims, litigation, administrative proceedings, settlements and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities, including clean-up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites, natural resource damages, property damage, personal injury and regulatory compliance or non-compliance. The resolution of these environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent environmental, health and safety regulations, including chemical safety regulations, changes in existing regulations, and shifts in perceptions of our products among regulators and the public, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently, there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies, environmental interest groups and the media in the United States and other countries of certain brominated flame retardants. In a related development, the State of California announced revisions to the required tests to assess the flame retardancy of filling materials used in upholstered furniture that became effective on January 1, 2014. In view of the size of the California market and the historical influence of California regulatory initiatives on regulators and consumers elsewhere in the United States, the impact of this revised California standard has started to reach beyond the state. The threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment may result in a decline in our net sales of certain brominated flame retardants beyond upholstered furniture applications and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could require us to enhance plant security and to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulations have been implemented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) aimed at decreasing the risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the United States. Pursuant to these regulations, these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain high-priority facilities develop a prevention, preparedness, and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack. We have registered certain of our sites with DHS in accordance with these regulations, have conducted vulnerability assessments at applicable sites and are awaiting DHS review and approval of security plans. Until that is done we cannot determine with certainty the costs associated with any security measures that DHS may require. These regulations may be revised further and additional legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic. It is possible that such future\nlegislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to us. We cannot predict the final form of currently pending legislation or other related legislation that may be passed and we can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a future reporting period. In addition, we may incur liabilities for subsequent damages in the event that we fail to comply with these regulations.\nWe operate on an international scale and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we have significant operations or interests. Changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements, export controls or international tax treaties could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent, in large part, on the economies of the countries in which we manufacture and market our products. Of our 2014 net sales, 43% were to customers in the United States and Canada, 29% to Europe and Africa, 20% to the Asia/Pacific region and 8% to Latin America. As of December 31, 2014, our net property, plant and equipment were located in various regions including 56% in the United States and Canada, 26% in Europe and Africa, 17% in the Asia/Pacific region and 1% in Latin America.\nThe economies of the countries within these areas are in different stages of socioeconomic development. Consequently, we are exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, governmental spending, social instability and other political, economic or social developments that may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may also face difficulties managing and administering an internationally dispersed business. In particular, the management of our personnel across several countries can present logistical and managerial challenges. Additionally, international operations present challenges related to operating under different business cultures and languages. We may have to comply with unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements, which could negatively impact our operations and ability to manage our global financial resources. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets. Moreover, we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property overseas due to uncertainty of laws and enforcement in a number of countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights. Changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations or the magnitude of their contributions to our overall financial performance.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit facilities may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nOur credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. The covenants limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or repay certain indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments, make investments, and enter into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Such restrictions in our credit facilities could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders in order to take certain actions. We may be unable to obtain such consents from our lenders, or obtaining such consents may be difficult or costly for us. Our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain (or hindered from obtaining) such consents.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities and other debt obligations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facilities immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our indebtedness. Our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of their assets as collateral under our credit facilities. If the lenders under credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and on the value of our stock.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks. A significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nSignificant portions of our businesses are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results. Effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results cannot be predicted because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. In certain foreign countries, some components of our cost structure are denominated in U.S. dollars while our revenues are denominated in the local currency. In those cases, currency devaluation could adversely impact our operating margins.\nWe are dependent upon a trained, dedicated sales force, the loss of which could materially affect our operations.\nMany of our products are sold and supported through dedicated staff and specifically trained personnel. The loss of this sales force due to market or other conditions could affect our ability to sell and support our products effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nProduction facilities are subject to operating risks that may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities. Such production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage and transportation of chemical materials and products, including pipeline leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, remediation complications, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous gases, storage tank leaks and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental damage, fines, civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. The occurrence of these events may disrupt production or incur significant costs, which could have an adverse effect on the production and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience unexpected difficulties and incur unexpected costs in the construction of new facilities, which may increase our costs, delay the start of production or disrupt our ability to supply our customers.\nThe construction of new manufacturing facilities entails a number of risks, including the ability to begin production within the cost and timeframe estimated and to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to meet the needs of the new facility. Additionally, our assessment of the projected benefits associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions, which in turn are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we experience delays or increased costs, our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, or other unforeseen events occur, our business, ability to supply customers, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems could compromise our information, disrupt our operations, and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees in our information technology systems, including our in data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information\ntechnology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached or disrupted due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such attack, breach or disruption could compromise our information technology systems and the information stored in them could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen and our business operations could be disrupted. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information or business disruption could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our operations.\nOur businesses depend upon many proprietary technologies, including patents, licenses and trademarks. Our competitive position could be adversely affected if we fail to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights or if we become subject to claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others.\nOur intellectual property is of particular importance for a number of the specialty chemicals that we manufacture and sell. The trademarks and patents that we own may be challenged, and because of such challenges, we could eventually lose our exclusive rights to use and enforce such patented technologies and trademarks, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. We are licensed to use certain patents and technology owned by other companies, including foreign companies, to manufacture products complementary to our own products. We pay royalties for these licenses in amounts not considered material, in the aggregate, to our consolidated results.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to restrict the use and disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary know-how, those confidentiality agreements may be breached. Additionally, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how, and others could obtain knowledge of such trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The failure of our patents, trademarks or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how and the brands under which we market and sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot be assured that our products or methods do not infringe on the patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of others. Infringement and other intellectual claims or proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 cease selling products that contain asserted intellectual property;\n\u00b7 pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u00b7 obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms; and\n\u00b7 redesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, our products to avoid infringing the rights of third parties.\nSuch requirements could adversely affect our revenue, increase costs, and harm our financial condition.\nOur patents may not provide full protection against competing manufacturers outside of the United States, the European Union countries and certain other developed countries. Weaker protection may adversely impact our sales and results of operations.\nIn some of the countries in which we operate, such as China, the laws protecting patent holders are significantly weaker than in the United States, countries in the European Union and certain other developed countries. Weaker protection may assist competing manufacturers in becoming more competitive in markets in which they might not have otherwise been able to introduce competing products for a number of years. As a result, we tend to rely more heavily upon trade secret and know-how protection in these regions, as applicable, rather than patents.\nAn inability to remain technologically innovative and to offer improved products and services in a cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur operating results are influenced in part by our ability to introduce new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers. For example, our organometallic business seeks to provide tailored products for our customers\u2019 often unique problems, which require an ongoing level of innovation. In many of the markets where we sell our products, the products are subject to a traditional product life cycle. Even where we devote significant human and financial resources to develop new technologically advanced products and services, we may not be successful in these efforts.\nJoint venture investments that we enter into could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on joint venture partners\u2019 financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners.\nA portion of our operations is conducted through certain ventures in which we share control with third parties. In these situations, we are not in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the facility, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments through partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions or block or delay necessary decisions. Joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor our joint venture partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent the members of our management team from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, action by, or disputes with, our joint venture partners might result in subjecting the facilities owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners. Our joint ventures\u2019 unfunded and underfunded pension plans and post-retirement health care plans could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur unfunded and underfunded defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement health care plans could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement health care plans is recognized through operations over extended periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time. Our funding policy for defined benefit pension plans is to accumulate plan assets through our cash contributions and prudent investment returns, such that, over the long run, will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by certain factors and assumptions, including the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, changes in the life expectancy of plan beneficiaries, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Similarly, our post-retirement health care cost is materially affected by certain factors and assumptions, including the discount rate used to measure these obligations, as well as by changes in the actual cost of providing these medical benefits.\nWe have underfunded obligations under our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $82 million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2014. Declines in the value of the plan investments, the discount rate used to measure liabilities, increases in life expectancy of beneficiaries or unfavorable changes in law or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required funding. Additionally, we sponsor other foreign and non-qualified U.S. pension plans under which there are substantial unfunded liabilities totaling approximately $87 million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2014. Foreign regulatory authorities may seek to have Chemtura and/or certain of our non-sponsoring subsidiaries take responsibility for some portion of these obligations. Mandatory funding contributions with respect to these obligations and potential unfunded benefit liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or future cash flows. In addition, we have unfunded post-retirement health care plan liabilities of approximately $108 million on a projected benefit obligation basis at December 31, 2014. Our actual costs with respect to our post-retirement health care plans could exceed our current actuarial projections.\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax asset position related to our utilization of net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and U.S deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\nWe evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for a valuation allowance based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably\npossible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.\nWe engage in acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business; we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nFrom time to time we engage in strategic acquisitions and divestitures which involve risks. We may not realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The integration of an acquired business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities or competitive responses. Other risks associated with past or future acquisitions include: the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, which could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to: effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and reduce fixed and other costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase our other products. These divestitures may on occasions, also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees, supply and transition service agreements, deferred purchase consideration and other financial arrangements, any of which could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our recently announced restructuring plan.\nWe announced a significant restructuring plan in November 2014, which includes plans to (i) eliminate the stranded costs from the sale of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business; (ii) reduce our manufacturing costs at several manufacturing facilities worldwide; and (iii) reduce selling, general and administrative costs at several of our locations. We expect to achieve cost savings of approximately $50 million in 2015. We have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated impact of our cost saving initiatives. These assumptions may ultimately be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these initiatives is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Some of our cost saving measures may not have the effect that we project, or we may be unable to sustain the cost savings. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these initiatives or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation, regulation and international accords.\nGreenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of international, national, regional, state and local attention. Cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been introduced in the European Union. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has promulgated rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions and regulation of greenhouse gas also could occur pursuant to future U.S. treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, new climate change legislation or pursuant to Executive Order.\nWhile not all are likely to become law, this is a strong indication that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices and establishing costly emissions trading schemes and requiring modification of equipment to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\nA step toward potential federal restriction on greenhouse gas emissions was taken on December 7, 2009 when the EPA issued its Endangerment Finding in response to a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The EPA found that the emission of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (which is emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels), may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Based on this finding, the EPA defined the mix of these six greenhouse gases to be \u201cair pollution\u201d subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Although the EPA has stated a preference that greenhouse gas regulation be based on new federal legislation rather than the existing Clean Air Act, absent legislative action, the EPA has begun to regulate many sources of greenhouse gas emissions.\nIf our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on July 31 of each year, or more frequently if required. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nIf we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500 million shares of common stock, of which 100.5 million shares were issued and 71.7 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock up to the authorized capital stated in the certificate of incorporation. Our Board may choose to issue some or all of such shares of common stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares of common stock may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Additionally, we have an incentive plan that allows for the issuance of up to 11 million shares (currently 4.6 million shares remain available for future grants).", "PERMNO": 38420, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "CHMT"}
