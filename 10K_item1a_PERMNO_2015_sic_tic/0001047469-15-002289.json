{"cik": "1182325", "company": "TANGOE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have had a history of losses since our incorporation in February 2000.\nWe were incorporated in February 2000. While we had net income of $3.0 million in 2012, $5.0 million in 2013 and $2.9 million in 2014, we incurred net losses for every fiscal year prior to 2012. Although we were profitable for 2012, 2013 and 2014, we cannot predict if we will be able to maintain profitability in the future. We expect to continue making significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain substantially increased revenue to maintain profitability, which we may be unable to do. We may also encounter unforeseen difficulties, complications, product delays and other unknown factors that require additional expenditures. In addition, the percentage growth rates we achieved in prior periods may not be sustainable and we may not be able to increase our revenue sufficiently in absolute dollars to maintain profitability and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nIf the market for connection lifecycle management services does not grow as we expect, our business will be harmed.\nThe market for connection lifecycle management, or CLM, services is developing, and it is not certain whether these services will achieve market acceptance and sustain high demand. Some businesses have invested substantial personnel and financial resources into developing internal solutions for CLM, so they may not perceive the benefit of our external solution. If businesses do not perceive the benefits of outsourced CLM services, the CLM market may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our ability to maintain profitability.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly operating results or guidance fall below the expectations of research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or guidance may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 our ability to attract new customers, obtain renewals from existing customers and increase sales to existing customers;\n\u2022 the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u2022 changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation, maintenance and expansion of our business;\n\u2022 service outages or security breaches;\n\u2022 the timing and success of new service introductions and upgrades by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 the timing and success of implementations for new customers of, and conversions of existing customers to, our invoice and payment processing software and service solution;\n\u2022 the timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies, services or businesses;\n\u2022 the timing of collection of payments from channel partners;\n\u2022 the financial condition of our customers; and\n\u2022 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the accounting treatment of the warrant shares that may become issuable to Dell could have an impact on our quarterly operating results. We currently value the warrant shares that are deemed probable of becoming exercisable on a mark-to-market basis until they are earned. Increases or decreases in our stock price will affect the mark-to-market adjustments of the common stock warrant shares, which will increase or decrease contra-revenue charges. The value of the warrant shares will fluctuate until the warrant shares are deemed exercisable and the value is fixed. This accounting treatment is applicable whether or not our Dell-related revenue actually increases or decreases in line with the market value of our common stock, and thus could cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nBecause we collect and recognize revenue over the terms of our customer agreements, the lack of customer renewals or new customer agreements may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe collect and recognize revenue from our customers over the terms of their customer agreements with us. As a result, the aggregate effect of a decline in new or renewed customer agreements in any one quarter would not be fully recognized in our revenue for that quarter and would negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Consequently, the aggregate effect of significant downturns in sales of our solution would not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers is generally collected and recognized over the applicable contract term.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations would grow more slowly than expected or decline and results of operations would be impaired.\nWe sell our on-demand software products and related services pursuant to agreements that are generally two to five years in duration, and have in some cases acquired businesses with customer contracts with shorter terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements after their terms expire and some of our customers may terminate their agreements for convenience. These agreements may not be maintained or renewed on the same or on more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to both maintain and grow our revenue depends in part on customer renewals. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software products, the prices of our software products, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers' spending levels. In addition, customers that are acquired by companies using competing service offerings may be required to begin using those competing service offerings, rather than renew their arrangements with us. If our customers do not renew their agreements for our software products, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete successfully would make it difficult for us to add and retain customers and would impede the growth of our business.\nThe CLM market is highly fragmented, competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with large multi-national communications providers, technology services companies, large independent software vendors, other independent technology and outsourced service providers selling telecommunications expense management and/or mobile device management solutions as well as with solutions developed internally by enterprises seeking to manage their communications expenses and assets. We compete with other technology and outsourced service providers primarily on the basis of customer references,\nability to deliver, breadth of solution and pricing. We and other technology and outsourced service providers compete with internally developed CLM solutions primarily on the basis of the relative cost of implementing a third-party solution as compared to inefficiencies or lack of functionality in internally developed CLM solutions.\nThe intensity of competition in the CLM market has resulted in pricing pressure as the market has developed. We expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future as existing competitors develop their capabilities and as new companies, which could include mobile technology and solution providers and one or more large independent software vendors, enter our market. Some of these competitors may offer telecommunications expense management and/or mobile device management solutions as part of a broad outsource offering for mobile communications services. Increased competition could result in additional pricing pressure, reduced sales, shorter term lengths for customer contracts, lower margins or the failure of our solution to achieve or maintain broad market acceptance. If we are unable to compete effectively, it will be difficult for us to maintain our pricing rates and add and retain customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nSome of our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can.\nIndustry consolidation may result in increased competition.\nThe CLM market is highly fragmented, and we believe that it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or will be acquired. Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they individually had offered. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships, such as with Vodafone's acquisitions of TnT Expense Management and Quickcomm in October 2010, Emptoris' acquisition of Rivermine in January 2011 and the subsequent acquisition of Emptoris/Rivermine by IBM in February 2012, Dimension Data's acquisition of Xigo in December 2012 and the merger of Veramark, Movero and the Pinnacle business of Paetec to form Calero in December 2013. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. The companies resulting from such combinations may create more compelling service offerings and may offer greater pricing flexibility than we can or may engage in business practices that make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. In addition, combinations such as IBM's acquisition of Emptoris/Rivermine may result in situations in which we may begin to compete in some CLM offerings with companies with which we have partnerships or strategic relationships. Any of the competitive pressures described above could result in a substantial loss of customers or a reduction in our revenue.\nInvoice and payment processing revenue is subject to risks that could limit this source of revenue.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from our invoice and payment processing software and service solution. The processes involved in invoice and payment processing are complex and involve third parties, and if these third parties change their policies or practices, these changes could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from this solution. In addition, where we bundle invoice and payment processing software and services with other software and services, the amount of invoice and payment processing revenue that we generate could affect the market's view of the overall pricing of our bundle of software and services.\nWe are currently migrating to our platforms the customers of several businesses that we recently acquired and we may in the future expand by acquiring or investing in other businesses, which may divert our management's attention and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe are currently migrating the customers of HCL-EMS, ProfitLine and Symphony's TEM Business, which we acquired during 2011 and 2012. While to date we have successfully migrated a number of these customers, there can be no assurance that we will complete the migration in a timely manner or at all and the cost of such migration may be more significant than we have estimated. Our business strategy includes the potential future acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, services or technologies. These acquisitions, investments or new business relationships may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. We may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, services, personnel or operations of companies we have acquired or companies that we may in the future acquire. These difficulties may arise if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the company's technology or services do not easily integrate with ours or we have difficulty retaining the acquired company's customers due to changes in its management or for other reasons. These acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities. In addition, any future acquisition may require us to:\n\u2022 issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022 use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022 incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022 incur large charges or substantial liabilities; or\n\u2022 become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.\nIf any of these risks materializes, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nOur sales cycles can be long, unpredictable and require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur sales cycle, which is the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale, is often lengthy and unpredictable. Some of our potential customers already have partial CLM solutions in place under fixed-term contracts, which limits their ability to commit to purchase our solution in a timely fashion. In addition, our potential customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process that can last six to nine months or more, and which requires us to expend substantial time, effort and money educating them about the capabilities of our offerings and the potential cost savings they can bring to an organization. Furthermore, the purchase of our solution typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer's organization, which further contributes to our lengthy sales cycle. As a result, we have limited ability to forecast the timing and size of specific sales. Any delay in completing, or failure to complete, sales in a particular quarter or year could harm our business and could cause our operating results to vary significantly.\nIf a communications carrier prohibits customer disclosure of communications billing and usage data to us, the value of our solution to customers of that carrier would be impaired, which may limit our ability to compete for their business.\nCertain of the software functionality and services we offer depend on our ability to access a customer's communications billing and usage data. For example, our ability to offer outsourced or automated communications bill auditing, billing dispute resolution, bill payment, cost allocation and expense optimization depends on our ability to access this data. If a communications carrier were to prohibit its customers from disclosing this information to us, those enterprises would only be able to use these billing-related aspects of our solution on a self-serve basis, which would impair the value of our solution to those enterprises. This in turn could limit our ability to compete with the internally developed CLM solutions of those enterprises, require us to incur additional expenses to license access to that billing and usage data from the communications carrier, if such a license is made available to us at all, or put us at a competitive disadvantage against any third-party CLM service provider that licenses access to that data.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to customers located outside of the United States, and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe are currently expanding our international sales and operations, including particularly in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, other parts of Europe, Canada, India, China, Australia and Latin America. This international expansion will subject us to new risks that we have not faced in the United States and the countries in which we currently conduct business. These risks include:\n\u2022 continued geographic localization of our software products, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing and staffing international implementations and operations;\n\u2022 challenges in integrating our software with multiple country-specific billing or communications support systems for international customers;\n\u2022 challenges in providing procurement, help desk and fulfillment capabilities for our international customers;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added or other tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards;\n\u2022 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022 potentially slower adoption rates of CLM services internationally;\n\u2022 political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u2022 reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nFurther expansion into international markets could require us to comply with additional billing, invoicing, communications, data privacy and similar regulations, which could make it costly or difficult to operate in these markets.\nMany international regulatory agencies have adopted regulations related to where and how communications bills may be sent and how the data on such bills must be handled and protected. For instance, certain countries, such as Germany, restrict communications bills from being sent outside of the country, either physically or electronically, and certain countries, such as Brazil, Germany, Italy and Spain, require that certain information be encrypted or redacted before bills may be transmitted electronically. These regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and international expansion of our business could subject us to additional similar regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant monetary penalties and compliance with these regulations could require expenditure of significant financial and administrative resources.\nIn addition, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. Our failure to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations or any security breakdown that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other customer data could result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or private individuals, which could harm our results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively manage and develop our strategic relationships with our channel partners, or if those third parties choose not to market and sell our solution, our operating results would suffer.\nThe successful implementation of our strategic goals is dependent in part on strategic relationships with our channel partners to offer our solution to a larger customer base than we can reach through our current direct sales and marketing efforts. Some of our strategic relationships are relatively new and, therefore, it is uncertain whether these third parties will be able to market and sell our solution successfully or provide the volume and quality of customers that we currently expect.\nOur success depends in part on the ultimate success of our channel partners and their ability to market and sell our solution. Some of these third parties have previously entered, and may in the future enter, into strategic relationships with our competitors. For example, IBM acquired Emptoris in February 2012, and Rivermine is a subsidiary of Emptoris. Further, many of our channel partners have multiple strategic relationships and they may not regard us as significant to their businesses. Our channel partners may terminate their respective relationships with us, pursue other partnerships or relationships, or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our solution. Our channel partners also may interfere with our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships.\nIf we are unable to manage and develop our strategic relationships, our potential customer base may grow more slowly than we anticipate and we may have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution, sales and marketing of our solution, which would increase our costs and decrease our earnings.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nWe increased our number of full-time employees from 541 at December 31, 2010, to 1,004 at December 31, 2011, to 1,383 at December 31, 2012, to 2,059 at December 31, 2013 and to 2,339 at December 31, 2014, and our total revenue from $68.5 million in 2010, to $104.9 million in 2011, to $154.5 million in 2012, to $188.9 million in 2013 and to $212.5 in 2014. Our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall business, customer base, headcount and\noperations both domestically and internationally. Growing and managing a global organization and a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively.\nThe loss of key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional personnel may impair our ability to grow our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical and sales personnel, including our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, and none of these individuals is party to an employment agreement with us. The replacement of these individuals likely would involve expenditure of significant time and financial resources, and their loss might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nWe plan to continue to expand our work force both domestically and internationally to increase our customer base and revenue. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology, software and communications companies. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of personnel to support our growth. New hires may require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our recruiting, training and retention efforts are not successful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue, our business will be harmed.\nOur software manages and interfaces with our customers' mission-critical networks and systems. Disruptions in the functioning of these networks and systems caused by our software could subject us to substantial liability and damage our reputation.\nWe assist our customers in the management of their mission-critical communications networks and systems and our software directly interfaces with these networks and systems as well as with enterprise resource planning and other enterprise software and systems. Failures of software could result in significant interruptions in our customers' communications capabilities and enterprise operations. For example, unknown defects in our mobile device management software, or unknown incompatibilities of this software with our customers' mobile devices, could result in losses of functionality of these devices. If such interruptions occur, we may not be able to remedy them in a timely fashion and our customers' ability to operate their enterprises could be severely compromised. Such interruptions could cause our customers to lose revenue and could damage their reputations. In turn, these disruptions could subject us to substantial liabilities and result in irreparable damage to our reputation, delays in payments from our customers or refusals by our customers to make such payments, any of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe emergence of one or more widely used, standardized communications devices or billing or operational support systems could limit the value and operability of our solution and our ability to compete with the manufacturers of such devices or the carriers using such systems in providing CLM services.\nOur solution derives its value in significant part from our software's ability to interface with and support the interoperation of diverse communications devices, billing systems and operational support systems. The emergence of a single or a small number of widely used communications devices, billing systems or operational support systems using consolidated, consistent sets of standardized interfaces for the interaction between communications service providers and their enterprise customers could significantly reduce the value of our solution to our customers and potential customers. Furthermore, any such communications device, billing system or operational support system could make use of proprietary software or technology standards that our software might not be able to support. In\naddition, the manufacturer of such device, or the carrier using such billing system or operational support system, might actively seek to limit the interoperability of such device, billing system or operational support system with our software products for competitive or other reasons. The resulting lack of compatibility of our software products would put us at a significant competitive disadvantage, or entirely prevent us from competing, in that segment of the potential CLM market if such manufacturer or carrier, or its authorized licensees, were to develop one or more CLM solutions competitive with our solution.\nA continued proliferation and diversification of communications technologies or devices could increase the costs of providing our software products or limit our ability to provide our software products to potential customers.\nOur ability to provide our software products is dependent on the technological compatibility of our systems with the communications infrastructures and devices of our customers and their communications service providers. The development and introduction of new communications technologies and devices requires us to expend significant personnel and financial resources to develop and maintain interoperability of our software products with these technologies and devices. The communications industry has recently been characterized by rapid change and diversification in both product and service offerings. Continued proliferation of communications products and services could significantly increase our research and development costs and increase the lag time between the initial release of new technologies and products and our ability to provide support for them in our software products, which would limit the potential market of customers that we have the ability to serve.\nWe may not successfully develop or introduce new and enhanced software and service offerings, and as a result we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers and our revenue may suffer.\nOur future financial performance and revenue growth depend upon the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our software and service offerings, including enhancements to Matrix to address additional connection types such as cloud software, infrastructure and services, machine-to-machine, enterprise social and information technology connections. We are continually seeking to develop and acquire enhancements to our solution as well as new offerings to supplement our existing solution and we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development and integration of new technologies, including unanticipated performance, stability, and compatibility problems, any of which could result in material delays in introduction and acceptance, significantly increased costs, adverse publicity and loss of sales. If we are unable to deliver new solutions or upgrades or other enhancements to our existing solution on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business will be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes with new software products and services, which could harm our sales and profitability.\nThe CLM market is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service introductions, driven in part by frequent introductions of new technologies and devices in the communications industry, frequent changes in, and resulting inconsistencies between, the billing platforms utilized by major communications carriers and the changing demands of customers regarding the means of delivery of CLM solutions. To achieve and maintain market acceptance for our solution, we must effectively anticipate these changes and offer software products and services that respond to them in a timely manner. Customers may require features and capabilities that our current solution does not have. If we fail to develop software products and services that satisfy customer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to renew our agreements with existing customers and our ability to create or increase demand for our solution will be harmed.\nActual or perceived breaches of our security measures, or governmental required disclosure of customer information could diminish demand for our solution and subject us to substantial liability.\nIn the processing of communications transactions, we receive, transmit and store a large volume of sensitive customer information, including call records, billing records, contractual terms, and financial and payment information, including credit card information, and we have entered into contractual obligations to maintain the confidentiality of certain of this information. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations and any such lapse in security could expose us to litigation, substantial contractual liabilities and loss of customers or damage to our reputation or could otherwise harm our business. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches and may incur significant additional costs to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. In addition, if we are required to disclose any of this sensitive customer information to governmental authorities, that disclosure could expose us to a risk of losing customers or could otherwise harm our business.\nIf customers believe that we may be subject to requirements to disclose sensitive customer information to governmental authorities, or that our systems and software products do not provide adequate security for the storage of confidential information or its transmission over the Internet or corporate extranets, or are otherwise inadequate for Internet or extranet use, our business will be harmed. Customers' concerns about security could deter them from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve confidential information, including transactions of the types included in our solution, so our failure to prevent security breaches, or the occurrence of well-publicized security breaches affecting the Internet in general, could significantly harm our business and financial results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary information, it will reduce our ability to compete for business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary information, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market software products similar to our own, which could decrease demand for our solution. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information, all of which provide only limited protection. We have twenty-two issued patents and twenty-four patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that our issued patents, any patents that may issue from our patent applications pending or any other intellectual property rights that we currently hold or may in the future acquire will prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers or otherwise provide sufficient protection of any competitive advantages that we may have. In addition, any action that we take to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights may be costly, time-consuming and a significant diversion of management attention from the continued growth and development of our business.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or infringe our intellectual property. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our successful legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our software products.\nAssertions by a third party that our software products or technology infringes its intellectual property, whether or not correct, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThere is frequent litigation in the communications and technology industries based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and become increasingly visible as a publicly traded company, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us may grow. These claims, whether or not successful, could:\n\u2022 divert management's attention;\n\u2022 result in costly and time-consuming litigation;\n\u2022 require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all; or\n\u2022 require us to redesign our software products to avoid infringement.\nAs a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and impair our business.\nIn addition, although we have licensed proprietary technology, we cannot be certain that the owners' rights in such technology will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from purchasing our software products or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.\nWe outsource certain of our research and development activities to third-party contractors, and a loss of or deterioration in these relationships could adversely affect our ability to introduce new software products or enhancements in a timely fashion.\nCertain of our research and development activities are carried out by third-party contractors, located both in the United States and abroad. The loss of or deterioration in any of these relationships for any reason could require us to establish alternative relationships or to complete these research and development activities using our internal research and development staff, either of which could result in increased costs to us and impair our ability to introduce new software products or enhancements in a timely fashion. Our use of such third-party contractors also increases the risk that our intellectual property could be misappropriated or otherwise disclosed to our competitors, either of which could harm our competitiveness and harm our future revenue.\nDefects or errors in our software products could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our products and result in significant costs to us.\nOur software products are highly complex and may contain undetected defects or errors, including defects and errors arising from the work of our outsourced development teams, that may result in product failures or otherwise cause our software products to fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations. Because our customers use our software products for important aspects of their businesses, any defects or errors in, or other performance problems with, our software products could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. If that occurs, we could lose future sales or our existing customers could elect to not renew their customer agreements with us. Product performance problems could result in loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance and\nthe diversion of development resources from software enhancements. If our software products fail to perform or contain a technical defect, a customer might assert a claim against us for damages. We may not have contractual limitations on damages claims that could be asserted against us. Whether or not we are responsible for our software's failure or defect, we could be required to spend significant time and money in litigation, arbitration or other dispute resolution, and potentially pay significant settlements or damages.\nWe use a limited number of data centers to deliver our software products. Disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\nWe host our software products and serve all of our customers from eleven third-party data center facilities. We do not control the operation of these facilities. AT&T operates our data centers in Secaucus, New Jersey and the Netherlands; Data Foundry operates our data center in Austin, Texas; iWeb Technologies operates our data center in Montreal, Canada; NTT Communications operates one of our data centers in Slough, United Kingdom and our data center in London, United Kingdom; FireHost operates our other data center in Slough, United Kingdom; Amazon Web Services operates our data centers in Sydney, Australia and Dublin, Ireland; Verizon Business operates our data center in Billerica, Massachusetts; and SunGard operates our data center in Nashville, Tennessee. Our agreements for the use of these data center facilities vary in term length, some being month-to-month and others expiring at various dates from 2014 through 2017. The owners of these facilities have no obligation to continue such arrangements beyond their current terms, which are as short as the current month in the case of month-to-month arrangements, nor are they obligated to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to continue such arrangements or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to new data center facilities and we may incur significant costs in connection with doing so. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our software products could harm our reputation and damage our business. Interruptions in the availability of our software products might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates.\nWhile we take precautions such as data redundancy, back-up and disaster recovery plans to prevent service interruptions, our data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, communications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, or vandalism or other misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our software products.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors' views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting constitutes a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to report on this evaluation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year. In addition, so long as we remain an accelerated filer or a large accelerated\nfiler under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to audit our management's annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting and report on this audit in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material, the market price of our stock may decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nThe technologies in our software products may be subject to open source licenses, which may restrict how we can use or distribute our software products or require that we release the source code of our software products subject to those licenses.\nCertain of our software products incorporate so-called \"open source\" software, and we may incorporate further open source software into our software products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our software products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available the source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our software products that contain the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions.\nWe provide minimum service-level commitments to many of our customers, and our inability to meet those commitments could result in significant loss of customers, harm to our reputation and costs to us.\nMany of our customer agreements currently, and may in the future, require that we meet minimum service level commitments regarding items such as platform availability, invoice processing speed and order processing speed. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments under these agreements many of our customers will have the right to terminate their agreements with us and we may be contractually obligated to provide our customers with credits or pay other penalties. If our software products are unavailable for significant periods of time we may lose a substantial number of our customers as a result of these contractual rights, we may suffer harm to our reputation and we may be required to provide our customers with significant credits or pay our customers significant contractual penalties, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nInsiders have substantial control over us and will be able to influence corporate matters.\nAs of March 6, 2015, our directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 11.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. The stock ownership of these stockholders could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate the cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in our software products could reduce our ability to compete successfully.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per-share value of our common stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022 develop or enhance our software products;\n\u2022 continue to expand our research and development and sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;\n\u2022 expand our operations, in the United States or internationally;\n\u2022 hire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022 respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which such shares were purchased.\nAlthough we have listed our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. In the absence of an active trading market for our common stock, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the prices at which they acquired their shares or at the time that they would like to sell.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations. Our stock price is volatile, and from July 27, 2011, the first day of trading of our common stock, to March 6, 2015, the trading prices of our stock have ranged from $8.01 to $26.05 per share. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 failure of any of our software products to achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 success of competitive products or services;\n\u2022 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u2022 regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022 litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 general perception of the future of the CLM market or our software products;\n\u2022 investors' general perception of us; and\n\u2022 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. Our outstanding shares of common stock may be freely sold in the public market at any time to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act, or to the extent such shares have already been registered under the Securities Act and are held by non-affiliates of ours.\nIn addition, as of March 6, 2015, there were 5,409,235 shares subject to outstanding options and 1,710,782 shares subject to issuance on vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, all of which we have registered under the Securities Act on registration statements on Form S-8. These shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, to the extent applicable. Furthermore, as of March 6, 2015, there were 10,000 shares subject to outstanding warrants. These shares will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such warrants are exercised as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if others publish or disseminate unfavorable reports or analyses regarding us, our business, our market or our stock, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, or provide relatively more favorable recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If others publish or disseminate unfavorable reports or analyses about us, our business, our markets or our stock, our stock price could decline.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of our cash reserves and might not use such funds in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nOur management will have broad discretion to use our cash reserves, if any, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these funds. Our management might not apply these funds in ways that increase the value of your investment. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these cash reserves. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our cash reserves.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022 authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022 limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022 requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022 controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 limiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and\n\u2022 providing that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12924, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "TNGO"}
