RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly.\nOur success depends on the growth and customer acceptance of our services.\nOur future success depends on our ability to significantly increase revenue generated from our cloud software solutions to business customers, including SMBs and mid-market and larger distributed enterprises. To increase our revenue, we must add new customers and encourage existing customers to continue their subscriptions on terms favorable to us, increase their usage of our services, and purchase additional services from us. For customer demand and adoption of our cloud software solutions to grow, the quality, cost and feature benefits of these services must be sufficient to cause customers to adopt them. For example, our cloud telephony and contact center services must continue to evolve so that high-quality service and features can be consistently provided at competitive prices. As our target markets mature, or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell new customers and obtain renewals from existing customers could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to extend our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers or new business from existing customers on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and growth.\nHistorically, our core service offerings have been our cloud software communication services and contact center services, which contributed a substantial majority of our revenues in fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Marketing and selling new and enhanced features and services, and additional communications and collaboration offerings, may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and their reactions to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer.\nTo support the successful marketing and sale of our services to new and existing customers, we must continue to offer high-quality education and customer support. Providing this education and support requires that our customer support personnel have specific technical knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult and costly for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations due to the extensive training required. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new mid-market and distributed enterprise customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and services to existing customers will suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers will be harmed.\nFurthermore, we operate in an industry that is subject to significant federal and state regulation in the United States and regulation by various governments and governmental bodies in other countries in which we offer our communications and collaboration services. Regulations may impede the growth of our business, impose significant additional costs, and require substantial changes to software and other technology. Also, new regulations may be adopted that materially reduce demand for our services by businesses.\nWe face significant risks in our strategy to target mid-market and larger distributed enterprises for sales of our services and, if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently derive a minority of our revenues from sales of our cloud software solutions to larger distributed enterprises, but we believe penetrating these customers is key to our future growth. We have a limited history of selling our services to larger businesses and have experienced, and may continue to experience, new challenges in providing our cloud software solutions to large customers. As we have targeted more of our sales efforts to mid-market and larger distributed enterprises, our sales cycle has become more time-consuming and expensive. As we expand farther into this market segment, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and revenue recognition may be delayed for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. In this market segment, the customer's decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales may require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more features, integration services and customization. Furthermore, larger customers' networks can be complex, and their lack of local IT expertise can adversely impact the quality of services that we deliver over their networks, and can result in delays in the implementation of our services that can adversely affect the installation of our services, which may lead to the cancellation of orders or services. This may create a perception that we are unable to deliver high quality of service to the end-users, negatively impacting our reputation and creating an adverse perception of our abilities to implement and deliver services resulting in cancellation of orders or services. Moreover, larger customers demand higher levels of customer service and in-person visits, which can impact our cost structure to implement and deliver services. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we might incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, could injure our reputation and further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nLarger customers also might require services in different international locations where we may encounter technical, logistical, infrastructure and regulatory limitations on our ability to implement or deliver our services, and be unable to provide the required services. These issues could limit the expansion of our services for some of these customers or result in cancellation of all of our services to those customers that want just one vendor internationally.\nAs a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and engineering services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and engineering resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially delaying revenue recognition on transactions for which we must meet technical or implementation requirements. Such delays in revenue recognition could adversely impact our periodic revenues and cause our operating results to become more volatile, and materially adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, we may invest significant time and resources with no assurance that a sale will ever be made. We also face challenges building and training an integrated sales force capable of fully addressing the services and features contained in all of the components in our communications and collaboration suite, as well as a staff of expert engineering and customer support personnel capable of addressing the full range of installation and deployment issues of larger customers that can arise with a comprehensive suite of services like ours. Also, we have only limited experience in developing and managing sales channels and distribution arrangements for larger businesses. If we fail to effectively execute our strategy to target mid-market\nand larger distributed enterprises, our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base could be materially and adversely affected.\nIntense competition in the markets in which we compete could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue growth and increasing or maintaining profitability.\nThe business of cloud software solutions is competitive, and we expect it to become increasingly competitive in the future. We may also face competition from large Internet companies, any of which might launch its own cloud-based business communications services or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future.\nIn connection with our cloud software communication services, we face competition from providers of cloud communication and contact center software services, such as RingCentral, Fuze, inContact, Five9, and Interactive Intelligence. In addition, because most of our target customers are already purchasing communications services from incumbent telephone companies reselling legacy communication equipment, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract these customers away from their existing providers. These competitors include AT&T, CenturyLink, Comcast and Verizon Communications in conjunction with on-premises hardware solutions from companies like Avaya, Cisco and Mitel. We also face competition from communications and collaboration vendors such as Cisco, Google, and Microsoft Corporation. Cisco and Microsoft, in particular, have recently signalled publicly their intent to begin competing more aggressively in the cloud communications market.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and brand awareness, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours. Our competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements that offer a more complete or better integrated product to customers. Competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our gross profits or decrease our market share. In addition, many of our customers are not subject to long-term contractual commitments to purchase our services and can terminate our service and switch to competitors' offerings on short notice.\nGiven the significant price competition in the markets for our services, we are at a significant disadvantage compared with many of our competitors, especially those with substantially greater resources who may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure. The adverse impact of a shortfall in our revenues may be magnified by our inability to adjust our expenses to compensate for such shortfall. Announcements, or expectations, as to the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors or us could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nBecause we recognize revenue from customer subscriptions over the term of the relevant contract, the effects of customer additions, cancellations and changes in subscribed services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nAs a subscription-based business, we recognize revenue over the term of each of our contracts, which generally range from one to three years. As a result, much of the revenue we report each quarter results from contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our cloud software solutions or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new sales or cancellations of our services and subscriptions from new customers or for additional services from existing customers will impact our ongoing monthly recurring revenue but will not be reflected fully in our operating results until future periods. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts.\nWe have a history of losses and are uncertain of our future profitability.\nWe recorded an operating loss of $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and ended the period with an accumulated deficit of $109.9 million. Although we have achieved operating income in four of our five most recent fiscal years, we incurred substantial operating losses prior to that and may incur operating losses in the future, which may be substantial. As we expand our geographic reach and service offerings, and further invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and regulatory compliance, we will need to increase revenues in order to generate sustainable operating profit. Given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or maintain operating profitability on an annual basis or on a quarterly basis in the future.\nA higher rate of customer cancellations would negatively affect our business by reducing our revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base.\nOur customers generally do not have long-term contracts with us and may discontinue their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their subscription period, which typically range from one to three years. In addition, our customers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. We may not accurately predict cancellation rates for our customers. Our cancellation rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer usage, pricing changes, number of applications used by our customers, customer satisfaction with our service, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.\nOur average monthly business service revenue churn was 0.8% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared with 0.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Our method of computing this revenue churn rate may be different from methods used by our competitors and other companies in our industry to compute their publicly disclosed churn rates. As a result, only limited reliance can be placed on our churn rate when attempting to compare it to that of other companies. Also, our churn rate can vary based on events that may not be indicative of actual trends in our business. Our churn rate could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service. Other factors, including increased competition from other providers of communications and collaborations services, alternative technologies, and adverse business conditions also influence our churn rate.\nBecause of churn, we must acquire new customers on an ongoing basis to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. As a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. If our churn rate increases, we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers beyond those budgeted, our revenue could decrease and our net loss could increase.\nAlthough the majority of our billing arrangements with customers are prepaid, we regularly monitor the percentage of customers who cease to pay for our services due to closing or downsizing their business. We believe that between 25% and 50% of our total customer churn is related to customers' financial condition. We cannot be certain that we will improve churn rates given current economic conditions. Due to the length of our sales cycle, especially in adding new mid-market and larger distributed enterprises as customers, we may experience delays in acquiring new customers to replace those that have terminated our services. Such delays would be exacerbated if general economic conditions worsen. An increase in churn, particularly in challenging economic times, could have a negative impact on the results of our operations.\nThe impact of the current economic climate and adverse credit markets may disproportionately impact demand for our products and services due to our target customer profile.\nThe majority of our existing and target customers are in the SMB and mid-market business sectors. These businesses may be more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. They also may be more likely to require working capital financing from local and regional banks whose lending activities have been reduced substantially since 2008, as a result of which many of our existing and target customers may lack the funds necessary to add new equipment and services such as ours. Additionally, these customers often have limited discretionary funds which they may choose to spend on items other than our products and services. If small and medium businesses continue to experience economic hardship, this could negatively affect the overall demand for our products and services, delay and lengthen sales cycles and lead to slower growth or even a decline in our revenue, net income and cash flows.\nThe market for cloud software solutions is subject to rapid technological change, and we depend on new product and service introductions in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe operate in an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced products, and continuing and rapid technological advancement. To compete successfully in this emerging market, we must continue to design, develop, manufacture, and sell new and enhanced cloud software solutions products and services that provide higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost. If we are unable to develop new services that address our customers' needs, to deliver our applications in one seamless integrated product offering that addresses our customers' needs, or to enhance and improve our services in a timely manner, we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market acceptance of our services. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our services is provided via the cloud, which, itself, has been disruptive to the previous premise-based model.\nIf new technologies emerge that are able to deliver communications and collaboration services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete.\nMaintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources is essential to new product development and continued innovation, and we intend to increase our investment in research and development activities to add new features and services to our offerings. If we are unable to develop new features and services internally due to certain constraints, such as competitive labor markets, high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors' research and development programs. In addition, there is no guarantee that our research and development efforts will succeed, or that our new products and services will enable us to maintain or grow our revenue or recover our development costs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources, to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors and to successfully monetize our research and development efforts could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers' growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our cloud software solutions by mid-market and larger distributed enterprises expands and as customers continue to integrate our services across their enterprises, we are required to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating our products and applications across our technology platform, integrating with third-party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. As our customers gain more experience with our services, the number of users and transactions managed by our services, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our service is being accessed, and the volume of communications managed by our services have in some cases, and may in the future, expand rapidly. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and services, to serve our growing customer base. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our cloud software solutions to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. These system upgrades and the expansion of our support and services have been and will continue to be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention and increasing our operating expenses. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely impact our financial results.\nTo provide our services, we rely on third parties for all of our network connectivity and co-location facilities.\nWe currently use the infrastructure of third-party network service providers, including the services of Equinix, Inc., and Level 3 Communications, Inc., to provide all of our cloud services over their networks rather than deploying our own networks.\nWe also rely on third-party network service providers to originate and terminate substantially all of the PTSN calls using our cloud-based services. We leverage the infrastructure of third party network service providers to provide telephone numbers, PSTN call termination and origination services, and local number portability for our customers rather than deploying our own network throughout the United States. This decision has resulted in lower capital and operating costs for our business in the short-term, but has reduced our operating flexibility and ability to make timely service changes. If any of these network service providers cease operations or otherwise terminate the services that we depend on, the delay in switching our technology to another network service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The rates we pay to our network service providers may also increase, which may reduce our profitability and increase the retail price of our service.\nWhile we believe that relations with our current service providers are good, and we have contracts in place, there can be no assurance that these service providers will be able or willing to supply cost-effective services to us in the future or that we will be successful in signing up alternative or additional providers. Although we believe that we could replace our current providers, if necessary, our ability to provide service to our subscribers could be impacted during any such transition, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The loss of access to, or requirement to change, the telephone numbers we provide to our customers also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nDue to our reliance on these service providers, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether caused by our service or products or those of another vendor, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of some of these types of problems may seriously harm our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur physical infrastructure is concentrated in a few facilities and any failure in our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions and could reduce our revenue, harm our business reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur leased network and data centers are subject to various points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage. Because our services do not require geographic proximity of our data centers to our customers, our infrastructure is consolidated into a few large data center facilities. Any failure or downtime in one of our data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our customers. The total destruction or severe impairment of any of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime of our services and the loss of customer data. Because our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our reputation. Additionally, in connection with the expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities from time to time, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server relocation or other unforeseen construction-related issues.\nWe have experienced interruptions in service in the past. While we have not experienced a material increase in customer attrition following these events, the harm to our reputation is difficult to assess. We have taken and continue to take steps to improve our infrastructure to prevent service interruptions, including upgrading our electrical and mechanical infrastructure. However, service interruptions continue to be a significant risk for us and could materially impact our business.\nAny future service interruptions could:\ncause our customers to seek service credits, or damages for losses incurred;\nrequire us to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities;\naffect our reputation as a reliable provider of hosting services;\ncause existing customers to cancel or elect to not renew their contracts; or\nmake it more difficult for us to attract new customers.\nAny of these events could materially increase our expenses or reduce our revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may also be required to transfer our servers to new data center facilities in the event that we are unable to renew our leases on acceptable terms, or at all, or the owners of the facilities decide to close their facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy or foreclosure, faced by our third-party data center operators, or any of the service providers with which we or they contract, may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Additionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, our ability to grow our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nFailure of our information technology systems to function properly could result in significant business disruption.\nWe rely on IT systems to manage numerous functions of our internal operations. Our third party ERP software is not operating on the vendor's most updated version of the software. Furthermore, we have internally developed IT systems that are not integrated with our ERP system. These IT systems require specialized knowledge for which we have to train new personnel, and if we were to experience an unusual increase in attrition of our IT personnel, we may not be adequately equipped to respond to an IT system failure. Although we have never experienced significant disruption of our IT systems based on the current infrastructure, any failure of our IT systems could result in a significant business disruption.\nWe are in the process of transitioning to a new ERP software provider, and we face risks relating to this transition. For example, we may incur greater costs than we anticipate to train our personnel on the new system; we may experience more errors in our records during the transition; and we may be delayed in meeting our various reporting obligations. To the extent any of these risks or events impact our customer service, we may experience an increase in customer attrition, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs to meet the commitments under our service level agreements, and our failure to meet these commitments could result in a loss of customers and expected revenue.\nWe offer some of our customers an \"end-to-end\" service level agreement (SLA) with commitments as to levels of service availability and voice quality for calls transmitted over the public Internet that are among the most stringent in our industry. These SLAs typically provides a commitment of at least 99.99% uptime and a mean opinion score of at least 3.0 for at least 98% of all calls carried over the network. All of our SLAs further require rapid response times in order to resolve issues. We may incur significant network support and maintenance costs in order to meet these commitments.\nWe have in the past and may in the future experience network failures, software bugs or other problems that interrupt service or impair call quality. If these problems are severe enough in duration or frequency, we may not satisfy our service level commitments under our SLAs, as a result of which our customers could be entitled to credits against future amounts due under contract, early termination rights or other remedies against us. If a sufficient number of customers exercise these remedies, the resulting reduction in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party vendors for IP phones and software endpoints, and any delay or interruption in supply by these vendors would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors for IP phones and software endpoints required to utilize our service. We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with any of these vendors. As a result, most of these third-party vendors are not obligated to provide products or services to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. The inability of these third-party vendors to deliver IP phones of acceptable quality and in a timely manner, particularly the sole source vendors, could adversely affect our operating results or cause them to fluctuate more than anticipated. Additionally, some of our products may require specialized or high-performance component parts that may not be available in quantities or in time frames that meet our requirements.\nWe currently purchase most of our IP phones from Polycom. On April 15, 2016, Polycom announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Mitel pursuant to which Mitel would acquire control over Polycom. Because Mitel is a competitor of ours, its acquisition of Polycom would pose a number of risks to our business if we continue to purchase IP phones from Polycom, including risks relating to our sharing of confidential information around potential sales opportunities.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our communications and collaboration software with third-party applications and mobile platforms that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline.\nThe functionality and popularity of our cloud software solutions depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our services with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise resource planning, customer relations management, human capital management and other proprietary application suites. Third-party providers of applications and application programmable interfaces, or APIs, may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our services, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our software with new third-party back-end enterprise applications and platforms used by our customers, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nOur services also allow our customers to use and manage our cloud software solutions on smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. As new smart devices and operating systems are released, we may encounter difficulties supporting these devices and services, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our mobile applications. In addition, if we experience difficulties in the future integrating our mobile applications into smartphones, tablets or other mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems, such as those of Apple Inc. or Google Inc., our future growth and our results of operations could suffer.\nIf our software fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs.\nOur customers use our service to manage important aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects, disruptions to our service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. Our services and the systems infrastructure underlying our cloud communications platform incorporate software that is highly technical and complex. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of defects, or the loss, damage or inadvertent release of confidential customer data, could cause our reputation to be harmed, and customers may elect not to purchase or renew their agreements with us and subject us to service performance credits, warranty claims or increased insurance costs. The costs associated with any material defects or errors in our software or other performance problems may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nOur inability to use software licensed from third parties, or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights, could disrupt our business.\nOur technology platform incorporates software licensed from third parties, including some software, known as open source software, which we use without charge. Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our platform to our customers, content creators and brand advertisers. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Alternatively, we may need to re-engineer our platform or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our platform. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such software to others on unfavorable license terms. Our inability to use third party software could result in disruptions to our business, or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings, which could impair our business.\nOur business depends on continued, unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users, but Internet access providers and Internet backbone providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to or bandwidth use of certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. In addition, users who access our services and applications through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a high-speed connection, such as Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G or LTE, to use our services and applications. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers offer products and services that directly compete with our own offerings, which give them a significant competitive advantage. Some of these broadband providers have stated that they may exempt their own customers from data-caps or offer other preferred treatment their customers. Other providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, while others, including some of the largest providers of broadband Internet access services, have committed to not engaging in such behavior. These providers have the ability generally to increase their rates, which may effectively increase the cost to our customers of using our cloud software solutions.\nOn March 12, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, released an order that would prevent broadband Internet access providers from degrading or otherwise disrupting a broad range of services provisioned over consumers' and enterprises' broadband Internet access lines. A number of providers and trade organizations have appealed the FCC's order. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this rulemaking or predict whether the FCC's rules will be upheld on appeal. Although we believe interference with access to our products and services is unlikely, broadband Internet access provider interference has occurred in limited circumstances in the United States and could result in a loss of existing users and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and growth.\nVulnerabilities to security breaches, cyber intrusions and other malicious acts could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations depend on our ability to protect our network from interruption by damage from unauthorized entry, computer viruses or other events beyond our control. In the past, we may have been subject to denial or disruption of service, or DDOS, attacks by individuals intent on bringing down our services, and we may be subject to DDOS attacks in the future. We cannot assure you that our backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, DDOS mitigation and other procedures that are currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure or data loss.\nCritical to our provision of service is the storage, processing, and transmission of confidential and sensitive data. We store, process and transmit a wide variety of confidential and sensitive information including credit card, bank account and other financial information, proprietary, trade secret or other data that may be protected by intellectual property laws, customers' and employees' personally identifiable information, as well as other sensitive information. We, along with others in the industry, will be subject to cyber threats and security breaches, either by third parties or employees, given the nature of the information we store, process and transmit. Our continued ability to securely store, process and transmit data is essential to our business.\nWe have implemented a number of measures to protect our services from cyber-attacks, and the various risks associated with cyber threats. For example, we have redundant servers that are intended to provide continuity of service in the event we suffer equipment or software failures in one location or on one set of servers. We actively monitor our network for cyber threats and implement protective measures periodically. We conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing and engage in remedial action based on such assessments. Depending on the evolving nature of cyber threats and the measures we may have to implement to continue to maintain the security of our networks and data, our profitability may be adversely impacted or we may have to increase the price of our services which may make our offerings less competitive with other communications providers.\nThere is no guarantee that we will not be adversely impacted by cyber-attacks. If our employees or third parties obtain unauthorized access to our network, or if our network is penetrated, our service could be disrupted and sensitive information could be lost, stolen or disclosed which could have a variety of negative impacts, including legal liability, investigations by law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and exposure to fines or penalties, any of which could harm our business reputation and have a material negative impact on our business. In addition, to the extent we market our services as compliant with particular laws governing data privacy and security, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a security breach that exposes protected information may make us susceptible to claims of false advertising and unfair trade practices for misrepresenting our level of compliance, in addition to any liability we may have for the breach itself.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. In addition, some of our customers contractually require notification of any data security compromise. Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur customers are increasingly asking us to assume liability for security breaches in excess of the amount of revenue we receive from them. In addition, there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign governmental agencies. Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. For example, lawmakers and regulators worldwide are considering proposals that would require companies, like us, that encrypt users' data to ensure access to such data by law enforcement authorities. Privacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of personal information, including credit card data, provided to us by our customers as well as data we collect from our customers and employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Should this occur, we may be subject to fines, penalties and lawsuits, and our reputation may suffer. We may also be required to make modifications to our data practices that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nGovernmental entities, class action lawyers and privacy advocates are increasingly examining companies' data collection, processing, use, storing, sharing and transmitting or personal data and data linkable to individuals. Self-regulatory codes of conduct, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, and lawsuits by private parties impose additional compliance costs on us negative impacting our profitability as well as subject us to unknown potential liabilities. These evolving laws, rules and practices may also curtail our current business activities which may also result in slimmer profit margins and reduce new opportunities.\nWe are also subject to the privacy and data protection-related obligations in our contracts with our customers and other third parties. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data or consumer protection, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation. Additionally, third parties on which we rely enter into contracts to protect and safeguard our customers' data. Should such parties violate these agreements or suffer a breach, we could be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation.\nThere is considerable uncertainty with respect to the state of law governing data transfers between the European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries with similar data protection laws, and the U.S. A preliminary agreement has been entered into by representatives from the U.S. and EU but it remains unclear what the final resolution will be for cross-border data transfers of personal information. For certain data transfers between the EU and the U.S., our company, like many others, takes advantage of what is referred to as the \"EU-U.S. Safe Harbor,\" in order to comply with privacy obligations imposed by EU-member countries. In late 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor. Some individual data protection regulators located in EU countries threatened to begin enforcement actions. Additionally, other countries that relied on the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor that are not part of the EU have also found that data transfers to the U.S. are no longer valid based on the European Court of Justice ruling. We have been working to establish alternative methods that would allow us to continue to transfer data to the U.S. from all countries that have invalidated pre-existing safe harbors. Some independent data regulators have adopted the position that other forms of compliance are also invalid though the legal grounds for these findings remains unclear at this time. Like many other companies, we continue to face uncertainty both with respect to the measures we have implemented following the ruling of the European Court of Justice and the ultimate resolution of the laws governing cross-border data transfers. We cannot predict how or if this issue will be resolved nor can we evaluate our potential liability at this time.\nWe could be liable for breaches of security on our website, fraudulent activities of our users, or the failure of third party vendors to deliver credit card transaction processing services.\nA fundamental requirement for operating an Internet-based, worldwide cloud software solutions and electronically billing our customers is the secure transmission of confidential information and media over public networks. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches, failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results. The law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled and states may enact their own rules with which we may not comply. We rely on third party providers to process and guarantee payments made by our subscribers up to certain limits, and we may be unable to prevent our customers from fraudulently receiving goods and services. Our liability risk will increase if a larger fraction of transactions effected using our cloud-based services involve fraudulent or disputed credit card transactions.\nAny costs we incur as a result of fraudulent or disputed transactions could harm our business. In addition, the functionality of our current billing system relies on certain third party vendors delivering services. If these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services, we will not be able to charge for our services in a timely or scalable fashion, which could significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe must maintain Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, compliance to bill our customers via credit card. If we fail to meet minimum-security standards for PCI DSS compliance, credit card providers such as American Express Company or Visa Inc. could refuse to process credit card transactions on our behalf and our ability to collect payments from our customers would be adversely impacted.\nWe may also experience losses due to subscriber fraud and theft of service. Subscribers have, in the past, obtained access to our service without paying for monthly service and international toll calls by unlawfully using our authorization codes or by submitting fraudulent credit card information. To date, such losses from unauthorized credit card transactions and theft of service have not been significant. We have implemented anti-fraud procedures in order to control losses relating to these practices, but these procedures may not be adequate to effectively limit all of our exposure in the future from fraud. If our procedures are not effective, consumer fraud and theft of service could significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, software and security flaws in our software can result in unauthorized access to our core network resulting in damages such as fraudulent toll usage on our network.\nAdditionally, third parties have attempted in the past, and may attempt in the future, to fraudulently induce domestic and international employees, consultants or customers into disclosing sensitive information, such as user names, passwords or customer proprietary network information, or CPNI, or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or to our data. CPNI includes information such as the phone numbers called by a consumer, the frequency, duration, and timing of such calls, and any services/features purchased by the consumer, such as call waiting, call forwarding, and caller ID, in addition to other information that may appear on a consumer's bill.\nNatural disasters, war, terrorist attacks or malicious conduct could adversely impact our operations and could degrade or impede our ability to offer services.\nOur \"cloud-based\" services rely on uninterrupted connection to the Internet through data centers and networks. Any interruption or disruption to our network, or the third parties on which we rely, could adversely impact our ability to provide service. Our network could be disrupted by circumstances outside of our control including natural disasters, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other malicious acts including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks. Our headquarters, global networks operations center and one of our third-party data center facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Should any of these events occur and interfere with our ability to operate our network even for a limited period of time, we could incur significant expenses, lose substantial amounts of revenue, suffer damage to our reputation, and lose customers. Such an event may also impede our customers' connections to our network, since these connections also occur over the Internet, and would be perceived by our customers as an interruption of our services, even though such interruption would be beyond our control. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe license technology from third parties that we do not control and cannot be assured of retaining.\nWe rely upon certain technology, including hardware and software, licensed from third parties. There can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future, will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in delays or reductions in the installation and deployment of our cloud software solutions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, and could harm our business. Software defects in the core IP and networking hardware we license from vendors, over which we have little or no control, can adversely affect our ability to deliver services to our customers and could harm our business.\nOur infringement of a third party's proprietary technology could disrupt our business.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the communications, cloud communication services, semiconductor, electronics, and related industries regarding intellectual property rights and, from time to time, third parties may claim that we, our customers, our licensees or parties' indemnified by us are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Third parties may also claim that our employees have misappropriated or divulged their former employers' trade secrets or confidential information. Our broad range of current and former technology, including IP telephony systems, digital and\nanalog circuits, software, and semiconductors, increases the likelihood that third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights. For example, on May 2, 2008, we received a letter from AT&T Intellectual Property, L.L.C., or AT&T IP, expressing the belief that we must license a specified patent for use in our 8x8 broadband telephone service, as well as suggesting that we obtain a license to its portfolio of MPEG-4 patents for use with our video telephone products and services. At the same time, we began an evaluation of whether AT&T IP's affiliated entities may need to license any of our patents or other intellectual property. We have continued to engage in discussions with AT&T IP to explore a mutually agreeable resolution of the parties' respective assertions regarding these intellectual property issues. We are unable at this time to state whether we will enter into any license or cross-license agreements with AT&T IP or whether we ultimately anticipate any material effects on our operating results or financial condition as a consequence of these matters.\nCertain technology necessary for us to provide our services may, in fact, be patented by other parties either now or in the future. If such technology were held under patent by another person, we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that technology, which we may not be able to negotiate at a price that is acceptable or at all. The existence of such a patent, or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms, could force us to cease using such technology and offering products and services incorporating such technology.\nWe have recently been named as defendants in two patent infringement lawsuits. On February 22, 2011, we were named a defendant in a lawsuit, Bear Creek Technologies, Inc. v. 8x8, Inc. et al., along with 20 other defendants. On November 25, 2015, we were named a defendant in the suit alleging infringement of a patent which expired in 2012. This suit is 2-Way Computing, Inc. (2-Way) v. 8x8, Inc. Each of these actions is described in more detail under Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\". If we are found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party in these lawsuits or other claims and proceedings that may be asserted against us in the future, we could be subject to monetary liabilities for such infringement, which could be material. We could also be required to refrain from using, manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. From time to time, we have received, and may continue to receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties' proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in these discussions and actions or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Furthermore, lawsuits like these may require significant time and expense to defend, may divert management's attention away from other aspects of our operations and, upon resolution, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInability to protect our proprietary technology would disrupt our business.\nWe rely, in part, on trademark, copyright, and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the United States and abroad. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright law, which afford only limited protection. We have additional United States and foreign patent applications pending. We cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents, and if they do, whether such patents will effectively protect our intellectual property. The intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage, and could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or misappropriated. We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the United States or internationally (where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited), and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours.\nWe attempt to further protect our proprietary technology and content by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights or the rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability.\nWe also may be required to protect our proprietary technology and content in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, or which we may not pursue in every location. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country, and the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States and elsewhere, and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage.\nBecause our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nAn important component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. We have formed several subsidiaries outside the United States, including a Romanian subsidiary that contributes significantly to our research and development efforts. We have also acquired two UK-based companies - DXI in May 2015 and Voicenet in November 2013. The risks and challenges associated with sales and other operations outside North America are different in some ways from those associated with our operations in North America, and we have a limited history addressing those risks and meeting those challenges. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:\nlocalization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\nunexpected changes in a specific country or region's regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, or political or economic conditions;\nmore stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union;\ndiffering labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\ndifficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;\nincreased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties;\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;\nlimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;\nlimited or insufficient intellectual property protection;\npolitical instability or terrorist activities;\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\nadverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nWe have limited experience in operating our business internationally, which increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. We expect to invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations. If we are unable to do this successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nAcquisitions may divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe completed two acquisitions in fiscal 2016, DXI Limited, API Telecom Limited, Easycallnow Limited and RAS Telecom Limited (collectively, \"DXI\") and Quality Software Corporation (\"QSC\") on May 29, 2015 and June 3, 2015, respectively. On November 29, 2013, we acquired Voicenet Solutions Limited (\"Voicenet\"), a UK-based provider of cloud communication services in the United Kingdom. In fiscal 2012, we completed two acquisitions of businesses. In fiscal 2011, we completed one acquisition and one investment in another company. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may make additional acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances with other companies. Risks commonly encountered in such transactions include:\nthe difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies;\nthe risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired services or technologies with our current services, products, and technologies;\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business;\nthe diversion of management attention from our existing business;\nthe inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of the acquired businesses;\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures, and policies;\nthe impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers, and customers as a result of any integration;\nthe loss of an acquired base of customers and accompanying revenue;\nthe loss of an acquired base of customers and accompanying revenue while trying to transition the customer from the legacy systems to 8x8's technology due to mismatch of the features, usability, packaging, or pricing at the renewal times;\nthe loss of an acquired base of customers and accompanying revenue due to failure and/or lack of maintenance/support for the legacy services and/or equipment/software/services being end of life;\nlitigation arising from or relating to the transaction;\nthe assumption of leased facilities, other long-term commitments or liabilities that could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and cash flow; and\nthe dilution to our existing stockholders from the issuance of additional shares of common stock or reduction of earnings per outstanding share in connection with an acquisition that fails to increase the value of our company.\nAs a result of these potential problems and risks, among others, businesses that we may acquire or invest in may not produce the revenue, earnings, or business synergies that we anticipate. In addition, there can be no assurance that any potential transaction will be successfully completed or that, if completed, the acquired business or investment will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other potential harmful effects on our business.\nOur future operating results may vary substantially from period to period and may be difficult to predict.\nOur historical operating results have fluctuated significantly and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, and a decline in our operating results could cause our stock price to fall. On an annual and a quarterly basis, there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results, many of which are outside our control. These include, but are not limited to:\nchanges in market demand;\nthe timing of customer subscriptions for our cloud software solutions;\ncustomer cancellations;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\nlengthy sales cycles and/or regulatory approval cycles;\nnew product introductions by us or our competitors;\nextent of market acceptance of new or existing services and features;\nthe mix of our customer base and sales channels;\nthe mix of services sold;\nthe number of additional customers, on a net basis;\nthe amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees;\nunforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\ncontinued compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements;\nmaterial security breaches or service interruptions due to cyberattacks or infrastructure failures or unavailability;\nintroduction and adoption of our cloud software solutions in markets outside of the United States; and\ngeneral economic conditions.\nDue to these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this were to occur, the price of our common stock would likely decline significantly.\nOur products must comply with industry standards, FCC regulations, state, local, country-specific and international regulations, and changes may require us to modify existing products and/or services.\nIn addition to reliability and quality standards, the market acceptance of telephony over broadband IP networks is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other. Our cloud-based communications and collaboration services rely heavily on communication standards such as SIP, MGCP and network standards such as TCP/IP and UDP to interoperate with other vendors' equipment. There is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application, and about the definition of the standards themselves. These standards, as well as audio and video compression standards, continue to evolve. We also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the FCC regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by Underwriters Laboratories, as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries. Standards are frequently modified or replaced. As standards evolve, we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products. We must comply with certain federal, state and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers, including marketing practices, consumer protection, privacy, and billing issues, the provision of 9-1-1 emergency service and the quality of service we provide to our customers. The failure of our products and services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our communications and collaboration services, subject us to fines or other imposed penalties, or harm the perception and adoption rates of our service, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nFor example:\nThe FCC has adopted network neutrality rules. In March, 2015, the FCC adopted new network neutrality rules that would prevent Internet service providers from blocking, degrading and engaging in other practices that would impair or otherwise interfere with services like ours. Several parties appealed the FCC's network neutrality order. We cannot predict the outcome of the appeal but interference with our service or higher charges for using our service could cause us to lose existing customers, impair our ability to attract new customers, and harm our revenue and growth. These problems could also arise in international markets. Most foreign countries have not adopted formal net neutrality rules like those adopted by the FCC.\nReform of federal and state Universal Service Fund programs could increase the cost of our service to our customers diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage. The FCC and a number of states are considering reform or other modifications to Universal Service Fund programs. Should the FCC or certain states adopt new contribution mechanisms or otherwise modify contribution obligations that increase our contribution burden, we will either need to raise the amount we currently collect from our customers to cover this obligation or absorb the costs, which would reduce our profit margins. Furthermore, the FCC has ruled that states can require us to contribute to state Universal Service Fund programs. A number of states already require us to contribute, while others are actively considering extending their programs to include the services we provide. We currently pass-through Universal Service Fund contributions to our customers, which may result in our services becoming less competitive as compared to those provided by others.\nWe may become subject to state regulation for certain service offerings. Certain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers, like us, are intrastate and therefore subject to state regulation. These states argue that if the beginning and end points of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering. We believe that the FCC has preempted states from regulating VoIP services like ours in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how this issue will be resolved or its impact on our business at this time.\nThe FCC adopted rules concerning call completion rates to rural areas of the United States. It is possible that we, like other providers in the communications marketplace, may be subject to fines or other enforcement actions should the FCC determine that our call completion rates to rural areas are, or have been, unacceptable.\nThe FCC may require providers like us to comply with regulations related to how we present bills to customers. The adoption of such obligations may require us to revise our bills and may increase our costs of providing service which could either result in price increases or reduce our profitability.\nThere may be risk associated with our ability to comply with FCC rules concerning disabilities access requirements and the FCC may expand disabilities access requirements to additional services we offer. We cannot predict whether we will be subject to additional accessibility requirements or whether any of our service offerings that are not currently subject to disabilities access requirements will be subject to such obligations. It is possible that we, like other providers in the communications marketplace, may be subject to fines or other enforcement actions if we are found not to be in compliance with the FCC's accessibility requirements.\nThere may be risks associated with our ability to comply with requirements of the Telecommunications Relay Service. The FCC requires providers of interconnected VoIP services to comply with certain regulations pertaining to people with disabilities and to contribute to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund. We are also required to offer 7-1-1 abbreviated dialing for access to relay services. It is possible that we, like other providers in the communications marketplace, may be subject to fines or other enforcement actions if we are found not to be in compliance with the FCC's 7-1-1 abbreviated dialing requirements.\nThere may be risks associated with our ability to comply with the requirements of federal law enforcement agencies. The FCC requires all interconnected VoIP providers to comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA. The FCC allows VoIP providers to comply with CALEA through the use of a service provided by a trusted third party with the ability to extract call content and call-identifying information from a VoIP provider's network. Regardless of our reliance on a third party for compliance, it is possible that we, like other providers in the communications marketplace, may be subject to fines or other enforcement actions if we are found not to be in compliance with the FCC's 7-1-1 abbreviated dialing requirements.\nThe FCC may require us to deploy an E-911 service that automatically determines the location of our customers. On June 1, 2007, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or the VoIP E-911 order, in which it tentatively concluded that all interconnected VoIP providers that allow customers to use their service in more than one location (nomadic VoIP service providers, such as us), must utilize an automatic location technology that meets the same accuracy standards which apply to providers of commercial mobile radio services (mobile phone service providers). Since then, the FCC has been conducting proceedings and inquiries concerning the implementation of such a rule. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be determined at this time and we may or may not be able to comply with any such obligations that may be adopted. At present, we currently have no means to automatically identify the physical location of one of our customers on the Internet. We cannot guarantee that emergency calling service consistent with the VoIP E-911 order will be available to all of our customers, especially those accessing our services from outside of the United States. The FCC's current VoIP E-911 order or follow-on orders or clarifications or their impact on our customers due to service price increases or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe FCC adopted orders reforming the system of payments between regulated carriers that we partner with to interface with the public switch telephone network. The FCC reformed the system under which regulated providers of telecommunications services compensate each other for various types of traffic, including VoIP traffic that terminates on the PSTN and applied new call signaling requirements to VoIP providers and other service providers. The FCC's new rules require, among other things, interconnected VoIP providers, like us, that originate interstate or intrastate traffic destined for the PSTN, to transmit the telephone number associated with the calling party to the next provider in the call path. Intermediate providers must pass calling party number or charge number signaling information they receive from other providers unaltered, to subsequent providers in the call path. While we believe we are in compliance with this rule, to the extent that we pass traffic that does not have appropriate calling party number or charge number information, we could be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties. The FCC's Order reforming payments between carriers for various types of traffic also includes a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Depending on the rules adopted by the FCC in this proceeding, the payments we make to underlying carriers to access the PSTN may increase, which may result in us increasing the retail price of our service, potentially making our offering less competitive with traditional providers of telecommunications services, or may reduce our profitability.\nOur emergency and E-911 calling services are different from those offered by traditional wireline telephone companies and may expose us to significant liability. There may be risks associated with limitations associated with E-911 emergency dialing with the 8x8 service.\nBoth our emergency calling service and our E-911 calling service are different, in significant respects, from the emergency calling services offered by traditional wireline telephone companies. In each case, the differences may cause significant delays, or even failures, in callers' receipt of the emergency assistance they need.\nThe FCC may determine that our nomadic emergency calling service does not satisfy the requirements of its VoIP E-911 order because, in some instances, our nomadic emergency calling service requires that we route an emergency call to a national emergency call center instead of connecting our customers directly to a local public-safety answering point through a dedicated connection and through the appropriate selective router.\nDelays our customers may encounter when making emergency services calls and any inability of the answering point to automatically recognize the caller's location or telephone number can result in life threatening consequences. Customers may, in the future, attempt to hold us responsible for any loss, damage, personal injury or death suffered as a result of any failure of our E-911 services. In July 2008, the President signed into law the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008. The law provides public safety entities, interconnected VoIP providers and others involved in handling 911 calls the same liability protections when handling 911 calls from interconnected VoIP users as from mobile or wired telephone service users. The applicability of the liability protections to our national call center service is unclear at the present time. Also, we may be exposed to liability for 911 calls made prior to the adoption of this new law although we are unaware of any such liability.\nAlleged or actual failure of our solutions to comply with regulations governing outbound dialing, including regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe legal and contractual environment surrounding calling consumers and wireless phone numbers is complex and evolving. In the United States, two federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and the FCC, and various states have enacted laws including, at the federal level, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, that restrict the placing of certain telephone calls and texts to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems, prerecorded or artificial voice messages and fax machines. These laws require companies to institute processes and safeguards to comply with these restrictions. Some of these laws can be enforced by the FTC, FCC, State Attorneys General, or private party litigants. In these types of actions, the plaintiff may seek damages, statutory penalties, costs and/or attorneys' fees.\nIt is possible that the FTC, FCC, private litigants or others may attempt to hold our customers, or us as a software provider, responsible for alleged violations of these laws. In the event that litigation is brought, or fines are assessed, against us, we may not successfully enforce or collect upon any contractual indemnities we may have from our customers. Additionally, any changes to these laws or their interpretation that further restrict calling consumers, any adverse publicity regarding the alleged or actual failure by companies, including our customers and competitors, to comply with such laws, or any governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could result in the reduced use of our solution by our clients and potential clients, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We anticipate that these risks will increase as we begin to market and sell our EasyContactNow service (which is currently sold in the United Kingdom) in the United States.\nIncreased energy costs, power outages, and limited availability of electrical resources may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur data centers are susceptible to increased costs of power and to electrical power outages. Our customer contracts do not contain provisions that would allow us to pass on any increased costs of energy to our customers, which could affect our operating margins. Any increases in the price of our services to recoup these costs could not be implemented until the end of a customer contract term. Further, power requirements at our data centers are increasing as a result of the increasing power demands of today's servers. Increases in our power costs could impact our operating results and financial condition. Since we rely on third parties to provide our data centers with power sufficient to meet our needs, our data centers could have a limited or inadequate amount of electrical resources necessary to meet our customer requirements. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime due to power outages by using backup generators and power supplies. However, these protections may not limit our exposure to power shortages or outages entirely. Any system downtime resulting from insufficient power resources or power outages could damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential customers, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.\nDecreasing telecommunications rates and increasing regulatory charges may diminish or eliminate our competitive pricing advantage versus legacy providers.\nDecreasing telecommunications rates may diminish or eliminate the competitive pricing advantage of our services, while increased regulation and the imposition of additional regulatory funding obligations at the federal, state and local level could require us to either increase the retail price for our services, thus making us less competitive, or absorb such costs, thus decreasing our profit margins. International and domestic telecommunications rates have decreased significantly over the last few years in most of the markets in which we operate, and we anticipate these rates will continue to decline in all of the markets in which we do business or expect to do business. Users who select our services to take advantage of the current pricing differential between traditional telecommunications rates and our rates may switch to traditional telecommunications carriers if such pricing differentials diminish or disappear, however, and we will be unable to use such pricing differentials to attract new customers in the future. Continued rate decreases would require us to lower our rates to remain competitive and would reduce or possibly eliminate any gross profit from our services. In addition, we may lose subscribers for our services.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our Board of Directors or by stockholders holdings shares of our common stock representing in the aggregate a majority of votes then outstanding, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL. Under Section 203 of the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or (i) our board of directors approves the transaction prior to the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, the stockholder owns at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors or officers and shares owned by certain employee stock plans) or (iii) the transaction is approved by the board of directors and by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting by a vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares held or controlled by the interested stockholder). These provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts.", "PERMNO": 85177, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "EGHT"}
