Risk Factors\nIn the execution of our business strategy, our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks. A summary of certain material risks is provided below, and you should take such risks into account in evaluating any investment decision involving the Company. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us and is intended only as a summary of certain material factors that could impact our operations in the industry in which we operate. Other sections of this report contain additional information concerning these and other risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Generally\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, by March 31, 2020, substantially all of the fitness centers in our national network were temporarily closed. A substantial number of our fitness partner locations remained closed through April 2020. Although some locations reopened in May 2020 and additional locations reopened in June and throughout the third quarter of 2020, the average monthly total participation levels of our members after such locations reopened were significantly below historical levels, thus adversely impacting our revenues during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns. Although some restrictions have eased in some jurisdictions, rates of COVID-19 infection in regions across the United States and the world have remained high in recent months, and some areas are re-imposing closures and other restrictions due to such high rates of COVID-19 cases. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting, and is likely to continue to affect, overall economic conditions in the United States.\nWe have faced and may continue to face reclosures and/or long-term closures and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our fitness partner locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies, or social distancing measures. Additionally, even if fitness partner locations are open, members may avoid public gathering places because of a perceived risk of infection or risk to health, which could reduce overall demand and adversely impact their use of our services. Because a significant portion of our revenues from our SilverSneakers program is based on member visits to a fitness partner location, this decrease in member participation has affected and could further adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 continues to affect our results will depend on future developments, including whether there are additional outbreaks, mutations, variants, or related strains of the virus in locations where we operate, and the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nConsumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by adverse general macroeconomic conditions and reduced consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This has negatively impacted, and may further negatively impact, the number of paid subscribers in our Prime Fitness program.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, we have implemented a work-from-home policy for our employees, which may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business. We closed our corporate offices and/or call centers from mid-March through May and began reopening our corporate offices on a limited basis in June as we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees. We have incurred, and may incur in the future, costs related to implementing our work-from-home policy as well as additional cleaning fees and supplies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe are uncertain of the potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and the severity, duration, and timing of the business and economic impacts from the continuing, unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, which has previously included, and may in the future include, among other things, significant volatility in financial markets and a sharp decrease in the value of equity securities, including our common stock.\nOur business strategy relating to the development and introduction of new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer and/or market acceptance and additional expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to focus on new products and services that enable us to provide immediate value to our customers. We cannot predict whether customers and/or the market will accept these new products and services, and if we fail to execute successfully on this strategy or to adapt this strategy as market conditions evolve, our ability to grow revenue and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Business Strategy\" in this report for more information regarding our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the ability to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as epidemics and pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including responses of governmental authorities to contain such epidemics and pandemics), increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses, and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.\nWe may experience difficulties associated with the implementation and/or integration of new businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products.\nWe may face difficulties, costs, and delays in effectively implementing and/or integrating acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products into our business. Implementing internally-developed solutions and products, and/or integrating newly acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), and technologies could be time-consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not be successful in implementing and/or integrating these new businesses, services, technologies, solutions, or products and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits.\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions and certain market risks may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic difficulties and other macroeconomic conditions (including any downturn or recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) could reduce the demand and/or the timing of purchases for certain of our services from customers and potential customers. In addition, changes in economic conditions could create liquidity and credit constraints. We cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed and, if such funds were available, that the terms and conditions would be acceptable to us.\nCertain of our interest rate swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, which may result in volatility in our U.S. GAAP earnings.\nWe maintain five interest rate swap agreements with current notional amounts totaling $311.1 million that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (\u201cde-designated swaps\u201d). The de-designated swaps are recorded at their estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value recognized each period in current earnings. Such changes may result in volatility in our U.S. GAAP earnings and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the value of which could become further impaired.\nWe have recorded significant portions of the purchase price of certain acquisitions as goodwill and/or intangible assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis (during the fourth quarter) or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is having an adverse impact on the overall economy, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions that have impacted the Company. In March 2020, we experienced a significant decline in the Company\u2019s market capitalization and in our actual and forecasted operating results, in addition to the unfavorable change in market conditions. As a result, management concluded that there were triggering events during the first quarter of 2020 necessitating an impairment evaluation of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (which consist of the Nutrisystem tradename and the SilverSneakers tradename). Following these evaluations, we recorded a total impairment loss of $199.5 million related to the Nutrisystem goodwill and tradename during the first quarter of 2020, which amount is reflected in loss from discontinued operations. We determined there was no impairment related to the SilverSneakers tradename or the carrying value of goodwill related to continuing operations. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we recorded additional impairment losses of $66.2 million and $24.0 million related to the Nutrition business, each of which is reflected in loss from discontinued operations. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $334.7 million and $29.0 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, remaining. If we determine that the carrying values of our goodwill and/or intangible assets related to continuing operations should be impaired, we may incur non-cash charges to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of continuing operations for the period in which the impairment occurs.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining highly skilled managerial and other personnel are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. Failure to successfully recruit executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring may harm our business and results of operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key newly hired employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face competition for staffing, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nWe compete with other healthcare and services providers in recruiting qualified management, including executives with the required skills and experience to operate and grow our business, and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of our business. These challenges may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified management and other professionals. Difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and other professionals, or in controlling labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe are or may become a party to litigation that could potentially force us to pay significant damages and/or harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, which potentially involve large claims and significant defense costs\n(see Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report). These legal proceedings and any other claims that we may face in the future, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all such claims and some claims may not be covered by insurance. Additionally, insurance coverage with respect to some claims against us or our directors and officers may not be available on terms that would be favorable to us. The cost of such coverage has increased in recent years and could further increase in the future. Further, although we believe that we have conducted our operations in compliance with applicable statutory and contractual requirements and that we have meritorious defenses to outstanding claims, it is possible that resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, legal expenses associated with the defense of these matters may be material to our results of operations in a particular financial reporting period.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, members and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including employee misconduct, cyber security breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather, epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks of disease.\nAdverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather may cause people to refrain, or prevent people, from visiting fitness partner locations and using our services. Additionally, widespread health epidemics or outbreaks of disease, such as influenza or COVID-19, may cause members to avoid public gathering places and negatively impact their use of our services. As some of the fees that we charge our customers are based on member participation, a decrease in member participation could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our customers or fitness center partners experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our financial position and results.\nAt any given time, one or more of our customers or fitness center partners may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions, such as the current events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in an increase in our customers\u2019 or fitness center partners\u2019 financial difficulties that then affect us. The direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and could negatively impact our operating cash flow. While we currently cannot estimate what those effects will be, if they are severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets and reduced liquidity, among others.\nIf our efforts to attract and retain paying subscribers for our Prime Fitness program are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to continue to attract paying subscribers for our Prime Fitness program will depend in part on our ability to offer convenience and value to our Prime Fitness subscribers and our partners\u2019 ability to effectively market the program. Our ability to attract and retain paying subscribers may be adversely affected by our competitors' relative offerings, pricing, and other factors, as well as other fitness programs (including digital offerings) in the marketplace. If our Prime Fitness subscribers do not perceive our products to be of value, we may not be able to attract and retain Prime Fitness subscribers. Additionally, COVID-19 has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers for our Prime Fitness program. We must continually add new Prime Fitness paying subscribers both to replace canceled subscriptions and to grow our Prime Fitness program beyond our current subscriber base. Further, if excessive numbers of our Prime Fitness subscribers cancel their subscriptions, in connection with COVID-19 or otherwise, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in\nwhich we provided services prior to the sale of our TPHS business.\nBecause of the international operations that we previously conducted as part of our TPHS business that we sold to Sharecare, Inc. in July 2016, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. While our policies mandated compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always protected us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties and could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Healthcare Industry\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers.\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers. The health plan industry may continue to consolidate, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain health plan customers, or continue to provide our products and services to such health plan customers on terms at least as favorable to us as currently provided, if they are acquired by other health plans that already participate in competing programs or are not interested in our programs. Increasing vertical integration efforts involving health plans and healthcare providers or entities that provide wellness services may increase these challenges. Our health plan customers that are part of larger healthcare enterprises may have greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. In addition, a reduction in the number of covered lives enrolled with our health plan customers or in the payments we receive could adversely affect our results of operations. Our health plan customers are subject to continuing competition and reduced reimbursement rates from governmental and private sources, which could lead current or prospective customers to seek reduced fees or choose to reduce or delay the purchase of our services. Finally, health plan customers could offer (and in some cases are offering) services themselves that compete directly with our offerings, stop providing our offerings to certain or all of their members (as one of our customers, United Healthcare, has done), or offer fitness benefits in addition to SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently derive a significant percentage of our revenues from three customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, three customers each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 39%, of our revenues from continuing operations. Our primary contracts with these customers continue through December 31, 2022. The loss or restructuring of a contract with any of these customers or any of our other significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. None of these three contracts allows the customer to terminate for convenience prior to the expiration of the contract.\nOur inability to renew and/or maintain contracts with our customers and/or fitness partner locations under existing terms or restructure these contracts under favorable terms could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our customers and/or fitness partner locations choose not to renew their contracts with us (which occurs from time to time), our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Loss of a significant fitness partner or health plan customer or a reduction in a health plan customer's enrolled lives (including as a result of increased unemployment and the resulting loss of health insurance coverage) could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, a restructuring of a contract with a health plan customer and/or fitness partner on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to us could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Moreover, the businesses of our fitness partner locations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the closure of locations, any public health directives, or social distancing measures applicable upon reopening of locations and reduced overall consumer demand for fitness center use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If a significant portion of our fitness partner network is unable to return to normal operations within a reasonable period of time as a result of financial or operational stresses brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to make alternative arrangements with substitute fitness partners on favorable terms or at all.\nReductions in Medicare Advantage health plan reimbursement rates or changes in plan designs may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is indirectly derived from the monthly premium payments paid by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to our health plan customers for services they provide to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, our results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for Medicare Advantage programs. An executive order issued in October 2019 seeks to encourage innovative Medicare Advantage benefit structures and plan designs, including through changes to supplemental benefits. Any changes that limit or reduce Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, such as reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under these programs, reductions in funding of these programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or elimination of coverage affecting the services that we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our health plan customers, and as a result, on our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with existing or newly adopted federal and state laws and regulations or new or revised interpretations of such requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to spend substantial amounts, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to penalties or negatively impact our ability to provide services.\nOur customers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation, and a substantial majority of our business involves providing services to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, we are subject directly to various federal laws and regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, billing and reimbursement requirements and other provisions related to fraud and abuse. In addition, our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans require us to comply with a number of regulatory provisions and to permit these health plan customers to perform compliance audits of our processes and programs. Many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may, in certain cases, result in unintended consequences that could impact our ability to effectively deliver services. Further, we are required to comply with most requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security laws and regulations and may be subject to criminal or civil penalties for violations of these regulations. Certain of our services, including health utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure and may be regulated by government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses, but little guidance is available to determine the scope of some of these requirements.\nWe continually monitor the extent to which federal and state legislation and regulations govern our operations. New federal or state laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing requirements that affect our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are found to have violated applicable laws, to have caused any of our customers to submit false claims or make false statements, or to have failed to comply with our contractual compliance obligations, we could be required to restructure our operations, be subject to contractual penalties, including termination of our customer agreements, and be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.\nHealthcare reform efforts may result in a reduction to our revenues from government health programs and private insurance companies or otherwise directly or indirectly impact our business.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various political, regulatory, scientific, and technological influences. Efforts at federal and state levels of government have resulted in laws and regulations intended to effect significant change within the healthcare system. The ACA, the most prominent of these efforts, affects coverage, delivery, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Among other effects, several of its provisions may increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions by commercial health plans, bans annual benefit limits, and mandates minimum medical loss ratios for health plans.\nHowever, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the net effect and future of the ACA. The Trump administration and Congress have made significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. As a result, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and determined that the rest of the ACA was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. On November 10, 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding this case,\nand the law remains in place pending the appeals process. It is possible that the reforms imposed by the ACA or uncertainty regarding significant changes or court challenges to the law will adversely affect the profitability of our customers and cause our customers or prospective customers to reduce or delay the purchase of our services or to demand reduced fees. Because of this uncertainty and many other variables, including the ACA\u2019s complexity and the difficulty of predicting the impact of changes on other healthcare industry participants and the ultimate outcome of court challenges, we are unable to predict all of the ways in which the ACA could impact us. Furthermore, we could also be impacted by other legislative and regulatory healthcare reform initiatives. For example, the Chronic Care Act of 2018 allows Medicare Advantage plans, starting in 2020, to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health. Additionally, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals (often referred to as \"Medicare for All\"). Further, the potential impact of the 2020 federal election on health reform efforts is unknown.\nRisks Relating to Information Technology, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\nA failure of our information technology or systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services depends on effectively using information technology. We rely upon our information technology and systems, employees, and third parties for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business. These technologies and systems and, therefore, our operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, network failure, improper operation by our employees, data privacy or security breaches, computer viruses, computer hacking, network penetration or other illegal intrusions, epidemics or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), or other unexpected events. Any disruption in the operation of our information technology or systems, regardless of the cause, could adversely impact our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cybersecurity incident could result in the loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage and use of personal data about the participants in our programs, including individually identifiable health information, as well as employees and customers. Additionally, we rely upon third parties that are not directly under our control to store and use portions of that personal data as well. The secure maintenance of this and other confidential information or other proprietary information is critical to our business operations. To protect our information systems from attack, damage and unauthorized use or disclosure, we have implemented multiple layers of security, including technical safeguards, processes, and our people. Our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. In addition, we are Health Information Trust Alliance (\u201cHITRUST\u201d) certified, which enables us to demonstrate compliance with industry-defined risk management and data protection requirements based on a standardized framework. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, technology failures, and advanced attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents, which are rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated. Personnel error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we or our third-party vendors or other service providers will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents or occurrences, which may result in unauthorized access by third parties, loss, modification, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of customer, employee, or our information; member protected health information; or other data subject to privacy laws, or that otherwise disable or degrade our systems, disrupt our customers\u2019 experience and our ability to efficiently operate our business. In addition, COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our information technology systems and our ability to securely preserve confidential information, including as a result of telecommuting issues associated with our employees working remotely. Such cybersecurity incidents or delays in responding to or remedying damage caused by such incidents may lead to a disruption in our systems or business, costs to modify, enhance, or remediate our cybersecurity measures, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or litigation under these or other laws,\nincluding common law theories, and subject us to enforcement actions, fines, regulatory proceedings or litigation against us, damage to our business reputation, a reduction in participation and sales of our products and services, and legal obligations to notify customers or other affected individuals about an incident, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and negative publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nAs a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices remain a priority for us. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nOur business is subject to new and changing federal and state privacy and security laws, rules and regulations, which impact our operating costs and for which failure to adhere could negatively impact our business.\nOur business is subject to various federal and state privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations. Some state laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations and applications. While we are using internal and external resources to monitor compliance with and to continue to modify our data practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new or changing laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), went into effect on January 1, 2020, and it applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and compliance with the new law requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals\u2019 requests. Moreover, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) was recently approved by California voters as a ballot initiative and will take effect January 1, 2023, and significantly modifies the CCPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA and, after July 2023, the CPRA, may result in governmental enforcement actions, private claims, including class action lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, the CPRA creates a new enforcement agency charged with enforcing the CPRA and imposes additional requirements including privacy risk assessments and audits as well as vendor contractual requirements for data sharing, license and access arrangements. The CCPA and CPRA also provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. We may also be exposed to litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if the personal, confidential or proprietary information of our customers is mishandled or misused by any of our suppliers, counterparties or other third parties, or if such third-parties do not have appropriate controls in place to protect such personal, confidential or proprietary information. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The obligations imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our business practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.\nFurther, our marketing and member engagement activities may be subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act and FTC and Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) rules and regulations. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subjected to class action lawsuit settlements or penalties, and regulators and courts may disagree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our marketing practices violate communications privacy laws could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by consumers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense or settlement by us.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital\nexpenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation.\nThird parties may infringe on our brands, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brands. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brands and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims.\nThird parties may make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.\nRisks Relating to our Credit Facility\nThe performance of our business (as it could further be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic) and the level of our indebtedness could prevent us from meeting the obligations under our Credit Agreement or have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital, or our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nIn connection with the consummation of the acquisition of Nutrisystem, on March 8, 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement was $466.7 million, which represented $496.3 million of principal on the term loans under the Credit Agreement less deferred loan costs and original issue discount.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If there are prolonged or worsening effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as long-term closures of our fitness partner locations, we could be unable to generate revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct our business, service our outstanding debt, and comply with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. This could, among other things, exhaust our available liquidity (and ability to access liquidity sources) and/or result in an acceleration of the maturity of a significant portion or all of our then-outstanding debt obligations, which we may be unable to repay or refinance.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, subject to certain exceptions, impose restrictions and limitations on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to, among other things, indebtedness; liens; negative pledges; restricted payments (including dividends, distributions, buybacks, redemptions, repurchases with respect to equity interests, and payments, redemptions, retirements, purchases, acquisitions, defeasance, exchange, conversion, cancellation or termination with respect to junior lien, subordinated or unsecured debt); restrictions on subsidiary distributions; loans, advances, guarantees, acquisitions and other investments; mergers and other fundamental changes; sales and other dispositions of assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries); sale/leaseback transactions; transactions with affiliates; conduct of\nbusiness; amendments and waivers of organizational documents and material junior debt agreements; and changes to fiscal year.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our future financial condition or our ability to react to changes in the economy or industry by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions (including any downturn or recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), loss of revenue and/or profit margins in our business, or to increases in interest rates, particularly with respect to the portion of our outstanding debt that is subject to variable interest rates;\n\u2022\npotentially limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on favorable terms;\ncausing us to dedicate a portion of future cash flow from operations to service or pay down our debt, which reduces the cash available for other purposes, such as operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\npossibly limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who may be less leveraged.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly, and changes in LIBOR reporting practices could lead to an increase in the cost of our indebtedness and adversely affect our results of operations.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest, generally using LIBOR as the benchmark, and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels, but if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations with respect to our variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows would correspondingly decrease.\nTo mitigate our exposure to future interest rate volatility with respect to our variable rate indebtedness, we have entered into interest rate swaps and may in the future enter into additional interest rate swaps, which involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. Considering hedging gains and losses and cash settlement costs, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps, and any swaps may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may adversely affect our variable rate debt and interest rate swaps. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom has announced that by the end of calendar year 2021 it will no longer require LIBOR submissions, resulting in the possible unavailability or lack of suitability of LIBOR as a benchmark rate. Discussions among the Financial Conduct Authority, the ICE Benchmark Administration and others regarding LIBOR cessation are ongoing, and a number of uncertainties remain. While our borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates as well as a method for selecting a benchmark replacement for LIBOR, the consequences of LIBOR becoming unavailable or not suitable at some point cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. Use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement for LIBOR as a basis for calculating interest with respect to our outstanding variable rate indebtedness or interest rate swap agreements could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in the cost of our indebtedness, and could affect our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 76788, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "TVTY"}
