{"cik": "912752", "company": "SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological obsolescence and employee relations. The risks described below, along with risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impair our business operations and our liquidity in an adverse way.\nOur advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control. This volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities.\nWe rely on sales of advertising time for most of our revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate. If we generate less advertising revenue, it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of our business may decline. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:\n\u00b7 the levels of automobile advertising, which historically have represented about one quarter of our advertising revenue; however, for the year ended December 31, 2014, automobile advertising represented 23.1% of our net time sales;\n\u00b7 the health of the economy in the areas where our television stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u00b7 the popularity of our programming and that of our competition;\n\u00b7 the levels of political advertising, which are affected by campaign finance laws and the ability of political candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds and are subject to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u00b7 the reliability of our ratings information measurements, including new ratings system technologies such as \u201cpeople meters\u201d and \u201cset-top boxes\u201d;\n\u00b7 changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located;\n\u00b7 the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, MVPDs, internet and broadband content providers and other print and media outlets serving in the same markets; and\n\u00b7 other factors that may be beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nWe have a high level of debt, totaling $3,928.7 million at December 31, 2014, compared to the book value of shareholders\u2019 equity of $405.3 million on the same date. Our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks, particularly in periods of declining revenues:\n\u00b7 we may be unable to service our debt obligations, including payments on notes as they come due, especially during general negative economic and market industry conditions;\n\u00b7 we may use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, especially during general negative economic and market industry conditions;\n\u00b7 the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes may be limited because a significant portion of cash flow is used to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt;\n\u00b7 our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs, additional acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u00b7 the cost to borrow from lenders may increase;\n\u00b7 our ability to access the capital markets may be limited, and we may be unable to issue securities with pricing or other terms that we find attractive, if at all;\n\u00b7 if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments, we might have to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations;\n\u00b7 we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus, less able to withstand competitive pressures; and\n\u00b7 because the interest rate under the Bank Credit Agreement is a floating rate, any increase will reduce the funds available to repay our obligations and for operations and future business opportunities and will make us more vulnerable to the consequences of our leveraged capital structure. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $1,725.9 million principal amount of our recourse debt relates to the Bank Credit Agreement.\nAny of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment, debt repayment or capital improvements or to respond to events that would enhance profitability.\nCommitments we have made to our lenders limit our ability to take actions that could increase the value of our securities and business or may require us to take actions that decrease the value of our securities and business.\nOur existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests. These restrictions and tests may require us to conduct our business in ways that make it more difficult to repay unsecured debt or decrease the value of our securities and business. These restrictions and tests include the following:\n\u00b7 restrictions on additional debt;\n\u00b7 restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for indebtedness;\n\u00b7 restrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to our capital stock;\n\u00b7 restrictions on some sales of certain assets and the use of proceeds from asset sales;\n\u00b7 restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions, satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without the consent of bank lenders;\n\u00b7 restrictions on permitted investments;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the lines of business we and our subsidiaries may operate; and\n\u00b7 financial ratio and condition tests including the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted (adjusted EBITDA) to adjusted interest expense, the ratio of first lien indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (STG) total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA.\nFuture financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests. All of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies, prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities. In addition, we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations (particularly if the economy weakens and thereby reduces our advertising revenues). If we default on our obligations, creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral. If this happens, we could be forced to sell assets or take other actions that could significantly reduce the value of our securities and business and we may not have sufficient assets or funds to pay our debt obligations.\nA failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could result in a default under such debt instruments, acceleration of amounts due under our debt and loss of assets securing our loans.\nCertain of our debt agreements contain cross-default provisions with our other debt, which means that a default under certain of our debt instruments may cause a default under certain indentures or the Bank Credit Agreement.\nIf we breach certain of our debt covenants, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately take possession of the property securing such debt. In addition, if any other lender declared its loan due and payable as a result of a default, the holders of our outstanding notes, along with the lenders under the Bank Credit Agreement, might be able to require us to pay those debts immediately.\nAs a result, any default under our debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAny insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding relating to material third-party licensees as defined by our Bank Credit Agreement, would cause a default and potential acceleration under the Bank Credit Agreement.\nOur Bank Credit Agreement contains certain cross-default provisions with certain material third-party licensees, defined as any party that owns the license assets of one or more television stations for which we provided services to pursuant to LMAs and/or other outsourcing agreements and those stations provide 10% or more of our aggregate broadcast cash flows. A default caused by an involuntary or voluntary petition filed for liquidation, reorganization or other relief of insolvency by a material third-party licensee, or a failure of a material third-party licensee to preserve and maintain its legal existence or any of its material rights, privileges or franchises including its broadcast licenses, would cause an event of default and potential acceleration under our Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2014, there were no material third party licensees as defined in our Bank Credit Agreement.\nDespite current debt levels, we may be able to incur significantly more debt in the future, which could increase the foregoing risks related to our indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $144.1 million available (subject to certain borrowing conditions) for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) of the Bank Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the debt instruments to which we are subject, and provided we meet certain financial and other covenants, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional senior debt and secured debt. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described in the risk factors in this report relating to having substantial debt could intensify.\nOur strategic acquisitions could pose various risks and increase our leverage.\nWe have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, subject to market conditions, our liquidity and the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, with the goal of improving our business. During 2014, we\nacquired certain assets related to, and/or equity of entities that own assets related to, and we began operating or providing certain services to 20 television stations, excluding dispositions.\nWe may not be able to identify other attractive acquisition targets or we may not be able to fund additional acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could strain our human resources. We may not be able to successfully implement effective costs controls or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. In addition, future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operation of our core business.\nCertain acquisitions, such as television stations, are subject to the approval of the FCC and potentially, other regulatory authorities. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest certain television stations if the FCC believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market, even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations.\nOur investments in other operating divisions involve risks, including the diversion of resources, that may adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nOur other operating divisions consist of businesses involved in sign design and fabrication, regional security alarm operations, fabrication and service of television broadcast antennas and transmitters, real estate ventures and a wrestling programming franchise and are reported separately from our broadcast segment. Managing the operations of these businesses and the costs incurred by these businesses involve risks, including the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from managing the operations of our broadcast businesses and diverting other resources that could be used in our broadcast businesses. Such diversion of resources may adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our investments in real estate ventures carry inherent risks related to owning interests in real property, including, among others, the relative illiquidity of real estate, potential adverse changes in real estate market conditions, and changes in tenant preferences. There can be no assurance that our investments in these businesses will yield a positive rate of return or otherwise be recoverable.\nFinancial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our industry, business, and results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial and economic conditions have been challenging and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could further reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Poor economic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automotive industry and service businesses, each of which is a significant source of our advertising revenue. Additionally, financial institutions, capital providers, or other consumers may be adversely affected. Potential consequences of any financial and economic decline include:\n\u00b7 the financial condition of those companies that advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automobile manufacturers and dealers, may be adversely affected and could result in a significant decline in our advertising revenue;\n\u00b7 our ability to pursue the acquisition of attractive television and non-television assets may be limited if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional capital on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 our ability to pursue the divestiture of certain television and non-television assets at attractive values may be limited;\n\u00b7 the possibility that our business partners, such as our counterparties to our outsourcing and news share arrangements, could be negatively impacted and our ability to maintain these business relationships could also be impaired; and\n\u00b7 our ability to refinance our existing debt on terms and at interest rates we find attractive, if at all, may be impaired;\n\u00b7 our ability to make certain capital expenditures may be significantly impaired.\nWe must purchase television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues. Actual revenues may be lower than our expectations. If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.\nOne of our most significant costs is television programming. Our ability to generate revenue to cover this cost may affect the value of our securities. If a particular program is not popular in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program. Since we generally purchase programming content from others rather than producing such content ourselves, we have limited control over the costs of the programming. Often we must purchase programming several years in advance and may have to commit to purchase more than one year\u2019s worth of programming. We may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred or\nbefore we have fully amortized the costs. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market. Additionally, our business is subject to the popularity of the programs provided by the networks with which we have network affiliation agreements or which provide us programming.\nWe may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation or program service arrangement with us, we are not able to negotiate arrangements at terms comparable to our more favorable than our current agreements, or if networks make programming available through services other than our local affiliates, which could increase our costs and/or reduce revenue.\nThe networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each station\u2019s commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during programming. The amount and quality of programming provided by each network varies. See Item 1. Business for a summary and Markets and Stations under Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business for a detailed listing of our stations and channels.\nAs network affiliation agreements come up for renewal, we (or licensees of the stations we provide programming and/or sales services to), may not be able to negotiate terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the relevant network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. Upon the termination of any of our network affiliation agreements, we would be required to establish a new network affiliation agreement for the affected station with another network or operate as an independent station. At such time, the remaining value of the network affiliation asset could become impaired and we would be required to record impairment charges to write down the value of the asset to its estimated fair value.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our affiliation agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the impact of an increase in reverse network compensation payments, under which we compensate the network for programming pursuant to our affiliation agreements, may have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to renegotiate retransmission consent agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements and networks with which we are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from retransmission consent agreements with them.\nAs retransmission consent agreements expire, we may not be able to renegotiate such agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements. This may cause revenues and/or revenue growth from our retransmission consent agreements to decrease under the renegotiated terms despite the fact that our current retransmission consent agreements include automatic annual fee escalators. In addition, certain of our networks or program service providers with which we are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from retransmission consent agreements with them as part of renewing expiring affiliation agreements or pursuant to certain rights contained in existing affiliation agreements. There can be no assurances that the amounts shared will not increase at expiration of the current contracts. In December, 2014, a new statutory provision was adopted which requires the FCC to adopt rules prohibiting joint retransmission consent negotiation by stations that are located in the same market but are not commonly owned. The FCC issued an Order on February 18, 2015, adopting Rules which implement the new statutory provision. This new Rule, when implemented may prevent us from jointly negotiating retransmission consent agreements on behalf of our LMA and other outsourcing agreement stations.\nThe effects of the economic environment could require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses.\nWe are required to analyze goodwill and certain other intangible assets for impairment. The accounting guidance establishes a method of testing goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value. For additional information regarding impairments to our goodwill and broadcast licenses, see Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets and Equity and Cost Method Investments under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6. Goodwill, Broadcast Licenses and Other Intangible Assets.\nKey officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite from ours and we may engage in transactions with these officers and directors that may benefit them to the detriment of other security holders.\nSome of our officers, directors and majority shareholders own stock or partnership interests in businesses that engage in television broadcasting, do business with us or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests. They may transact some business with us upon approval by the independent members of our board of directors even if there is a conflict of interest or they may engage in business competitive to our business and those transactions may benefit the officers, directors or majority shareholders to the detriment of our security holders. Each of David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, and J. Duncan Smith is an officer and director of Sinclair and Robert E. Smith is a director of Sinclair. Together, the Smiths hold shares of our common stock that control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.\nThe Smiths own businesses that lease real property and tower space to us and engage in other transactions with us. David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith, Robert E. Smith and David B. Amy, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, together own interests (less than 5% in aggregate) in Allegiance Capital Limited Partnership, a limited partnership in which we also hold an interest. Frederick G. Smith owns an interest (less than 1%) in Patriot Capital II, L.P., a limited partnership in which we also hold an interest. David Smith owns an interest (less than 3%) in Towson Row LLC, a real estate venture, which we also hold an interest. For additional information regarding our related person transactions, see Note 12. Related Person Transactions. We can give no assurance that these transactions or any transactions that we may enter into in the future with our officers, directors or majority shareholders, have been, or will be, negotiated on terms as favorable to us as we would obtain from unrelated parties. Maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers, directors and majority shareholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that we might pursue. These limitations do not, however, prohibit all such transactions.\nWe depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of our senior executive officers or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.\nWe depend on the efforts of our management and other key employees. The success of our business depends heavily on our ability to develop and retain management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our key personnel. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Smiths exercise control over most matters submitted to a shareholder vote and may have interests that differ from other security holders. They may, therefore, take actions that are not in the interests of other security holders.\nDavid D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith and Robert E. Smith hold shares representing approximately 76.5% of the common stock voting rights of us as of February 13, 2015 and, therefore, control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors, adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving corporate transactions. The Smiths hold substantially all of the Class B Common Stock, which have ten votes per share. Our Class A Common Stock has only one vote per share. In addition, the Smiths hold half our board of directors\u2019 seats and, therefore, have the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies. The Smiths have entered into a stockholders\u2019 agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to vote for each other as candidates for election to our board of directors until June 13, 2015.\nAlthough in the past the Smiths have recused themselves from related person transactions, circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Smiths, as the controlling security holders, could be in conflict with the interests of other security holders and the Smiths would have the ability to cause us to take actions in their interest. In addition, the Smiths could pursue acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to our other security holders. Further, the concentration of ownership in the Smiths may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares.\n(See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters and Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, which will be included as part of our Proxy Statement for our 2012 Annual Meeting.)\nSignificant divestitures by the Smiths could cause them to own or control less than 51% of the voting power of our shares, which would in turn give Cunningham the right to terminate the LMAs and other outsourcing agreements with Cunningham\ndue to a \u201cchange in control.\u201d Any such terminations would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The FCC\u2019s multiple ownership rules limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets. See Changes in rules on local marketing agreements in the risk factor below.\nWe may be subject to fines and other penalties related to violations of FCC indecency rules and other FCC rules and policies, the enforcement of which has increased in recent years, and complaints related to such violations may delay our renewal applications with the FCC.\nWe provide a significant amount of live news reporting that is provided by the broadcast networks or is controlled by our on-air news talent. Although both broadcast network and our on-air talent have generally been professional and careful in what they say, there is always the possibility that information may be reported that is inaccurate or even in violation of certain indecency rules promulgated by the FCC. In addition, entertainment and sports programming provided by broadcast syndicators and networks may contain content that is in violation of the indecency rules promulgated by the FCC. Because the interpretation by the courts and the FCC of the indecency rules is not always clear, it is sometimes difficult for us to determine in advance what may be indecent programming. We have insurance to cover some of the liabilities that may occur, but the FCC has enhanced its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency. In addition, in 2006, Congress dramatically increased the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming and potentially subjects broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material. We are currently subject to pending FCC inquiries and proceedings relating to alleged violations of indecency, sponsorship identification, children\u2019s programming and captioning rules. There can be no assurance that an incident that may lead to significant fines or other penalties by the FCC can be avoided.\nIn addition, action on many license renewal applications, including those we have filed, has been delayed because of, among other reasons, the pendency of complaints that programming aired by the various networks contained indecent material and complaints regarding alleged violations of sponsorship identification, children\u2019s programming and captioning rules. We cannot predict when the FCC will address these complaints and act on the renewal applications. We continue to have operating authority until final action is taken on our renewal applications.\nFederal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility, which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs.\nThe FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry. We must ask the FCC\u2019s approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew, assign or modify a license, purchase a new station, sell an existing station or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that hold a license. Our FCC licenses and those of the licensees for which we provide services to pursuant to LMAs and other outsourcing agreements are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions in a timely manner, if at all. If licenses are not renewed or acquisitions are not approved, we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned.\nIn addition, Congress and the FCC may, in the future, adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters (including, but not limited to, technological changes in spectrum assigned to particular services) that could, directly or indirectly, materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties. (See Item 1. Business.)\nThe FCC\u2019s multiple ownership rules limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets.\nChanges in rules on television ownership\nAs discussed in National Ownership Rule under Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business, the FCC is currently considering elimination of the discount given to owners of UHF stations in determining compliance with the cap. Because we would be near the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount, the proposed change, if adopted, could limit our ability to acquire television stations in additional markets. While this rulemaking is pending, the FCC may not allow us to acquire additional television stations that would put us over the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount.\nUnder federal law, the FCC is required to review its ownership rules every four years (a \u2018\u2018Quadrennial Review\u2019\u2019) to determine whether they are necessary in the public interest as the result of competition and to repeal or modify any\nregulation the FCC determines to be no longer in the public interest. As a result of its most recently completed Quadrennial Review, the FCC released an order in February 2008, containing its current local ownership rules, which re-adopted its 1999 local television ownership rule. Those rules were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and a request for certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court.\nOn December 22, 2011, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in its 2010 Quadrennial Review. Numerous parties, including Sinclair, submitted comments in response to that Notice. On March 30, 2014, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Report and Order (the \u2018\u2018Further Notice\u2019\u2019) and announced that it would incorporate the record of the 2010 Quadrennial Review into a new 2014 Quadrennial Review, and requested additional comments on, among other things, whether to eliminate restrictions on newspaper/radio combinations and whether to eliminate the radio/television cross-ownership rule. The Further Notice indicated that the FCC intended to retain the current local television and radio ownership rule with a minor technical update and to retain the prohibition on the cross ownership of newspapers and television without modification.\nThe FCC adopted a new rule in the Further Notice which causes a station to be attributable to the owner of another station in the market which sells more than 15 percent of the advertising on the first station pursuant to a JSA/SSA or other arrangement. Parties to such agreements must come into compliance with these new rules by December 19, 2016. Petitions for review of that portion of the Further Notice have been filed in the U.S. Courts of Appeal, and we cannot predict their outcome. We are currently evaluating whether to seek one or more waivers of the new rules, or to modify or terminate our current JSA/SSAs.\nChanges in rules on local marketing agreements\nCertain of our stations have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or LMAs. One typical type of LMA is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such programming segments on the other licensee\u2019s station subject to the ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee. We believe these arrangements allow us to reduce our operating expenses and enhance profitability.\nSee Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership and Local Marketing Agreements within Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.\nUse of outsourcing agreements\nIn addition to our LMAs, we have entered into outsourcing agreements whereby 28 stations (and may seek opportunities for additional) provide or are provided various non-programming related services such as sales, operational and managerial services to or by other stations within the same markets. Pursuant to these agreements, 27 of our stations currently provide services to one or more stations in each\u2019s respective market and another party provides services to 1 of our stations. For additional information, refer to Markets and Stations under the Television Broadcasting section.\nWe believe this structure allows stations to achieve operational efficiencies and economies of scale, which should otherwise improve broadcast cash flow and competitive positions. The FCC adopted a new rule which causes a station to be attributable to the owner of another station in the market which sells more than 15 percent of the advertising on the first station pursuant to an outsourcing arrangement. Parties to such agreements must come into compliance with these new rules by December 19, 2016. Appeals of that portion of the Further Notice have been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals, and we cannot predict their outcome. We are currently evaluating whether to seek one or more waivers of the new rules, or to modify or terminate our current JSAs. We cannot predict whether we will be able to terminate or restructure such arrangements on terms that are as advantageous to us as the current arrangements. In addition, on March 12, 2014, the FCC issued a public notice providing guidelines as to the FCC\u2019s processing of applications that seek approval of proposed transactions that involve combinations of sharing arrangements and contingent or financial interests. These processing guidelines will likely affect our ability to enter into JSA/SSAs in connection with future acquisitions.\nIf we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs and other outsourcing agreements, our business could be affected in the following ways:\n\u00b7 Loss of revenues. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, we would lose some or all of the revenues generated from those arrangements. We would lose revenue because we will have less demographic options, a smaller audience distribution and lower revenue share to offer to advertisers. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014, we generated $105.2 million of net revenue from our 12 LMAs. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we earned $48.8 million of revenue from other outsourcing agreements.\n\u00b7 Increased costs. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, our cost structure would increase as we would potentially lose significant operating synergies and we may also need to add new employees. With termination of LMAs, we likely would incur increased programming costs because we will be competing with the separately owned station for syndicated programming.\n\u00b7 Losses on investments. As part of certain of our arrangements, we own the non-license assets used by the stations with which we have arrangements. If certain of these arrangements are no longer permitted, we would be forced to sell these assets, restructure our agreements or find another use for them. If this happens, the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and, therefore, we cannot be certain of a favorable return on our original investments.\n\u00b7 Termination penalties. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements before the terms of the arrangements expire, or under certain circumstances, we elect not to extend the terms of the arrangements, we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of certain of our arrangements. Any such termination penalties could be material.\n\u00b7 Alternative arrangements. If the FCC requires us to terminate the existing arrangements, we may enter into one or more alternative arrangements. Any such arrangements may be on terms that are less beneficial to us than the existing arrangements.\nFailure of owner / licensee to exercise control\nThe FCC requires the owner / licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station. As a result, the owners / licensees of those stations with which we have LMAs or outsourcing agreements can exert their control in ways that may be counter to our interests, including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances. The preemption and termination rights cause some uncertainty as to whether we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased under our LMAs and therefore, uncertainty about the advertising revenue that we will receive from such programming. In addition, if the FCC determines that the owner / licensee is not exercising sufficient control, it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of that license. Any one of these scenarios, especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license, might result in a reduction of our cash flow and an increase in our operating costs or margins. In addition, penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses, putting our own licenses at risk.\nThe pendency and indeterminacy of the outcome of these ownership rules, which may limit our ability to provide services to additional or existing stations pursuant to licenses, LMAs, outsourcing agreements or otherwise, expose us to a certain amount of volatility, particularly if the outcomes are adverse to us. Further, resolution of these ownership rules has been and will likely continue to be a cost burden and a distraction to our management and the continued absence of a resolution may have a negative effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s National Broadband Plan may result in a loss of spectrum for our stations potentially adversely impacting our ability to compete.\nThe FCC\u2019s National Broadband Plan contemplates the voluntary reallocation of spectrum from broadcasters for other purposes which may include wireless broadband. On November 30, 2010, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that seeks comments on three methods that would permit up to 120 MHz of television spectrum to be reallocated for wireless broadband use: (a) encouraging broadcasters \u201cvoluntarily\u201d to return 120 MHz of spectrum to be auctioned for wireless broadband service, with some currently unknown portion of the proceeds to be paid to broadcasters; (b) adoption of rules to encourage two or more digital television stations to share the same 6 MHz channel, thus lessening the spectrum occupied by each station; and (c) to adopt new engineering rules which would make VHF channels more desirable for digital television operations, thus encouraging stations to move from their current UHF channels into the VHF band, freeing UHF spectrum for wireless broadband use. This initiative raises a number of issues that could impact the broadcast industry. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted, or, if adopted, the form of such final rules or whether they would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete. Moreover, we cannot predict whether the FCC might adopt even more stringent requirements, or incentives to abandon current spectrum, if its initiatives are adopted but do have the desired result in freeing what the agency deems sufficient spectrum for wireless broadband use.\nCongress recently passed legislation providing the FCC with authority to conduct so-called \u201cincentive auctions\u201d to begin the process of auctioning and repurposing broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. Incentive auction authority allows the FCC to share the proceeds of spectrum auctions with incumbent television station licensees who give up their licenses (or in some cases, move to a different channel) to facilitate spectrum auctions. The legislation includes specific\nprovisions governing incentive auctions of spectrum that is used by television broadcasters today. The upper UHF bands allocated to television broadcasting will likely be used to provide service to mobile devices and are widely expected to draw bids from wireless operators at auction. The legislation contemplates that the FCC will encourage broadcasters to tender their licenses for auction. Using models it has been developing for the last two years (and will continue to develop) the FCC would then \u201crepack\u201d non-tendering broadcasters into the lower portion of the UHF band auction new \u201cflexible use\u201d wireless licenses in the upper portion of the UHF band. As a result of these changes, new companies will likely be able to enter our markets to compete with us. The proposals for television stations to participate in the incentive auctions are voluntary and at this time we have not decided whether the company will participate on behalf of any of its stations. On September 28, 2012, the FCC voted in favor of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that launches the incentive auction process to clear a portion of the television band that will make way for mobile broadband use. We cannot predict the final outcome of this proceeding.\nCompetition from other broadcasters or other content providers and changes in technology may cause a reduction in our advertising revenues and/or an increase in our operating costs.\nNew technology and the subdivision of markets\nCable providers, direct broadcast satellite companies and telecommunication companies are developing new technology that allows them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets. Competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues. The decreased cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue. In addition, technologies that allow viewers to digitally record, store and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials as recorded by media measurement services such as Nielsen Media Research and, as a result, lower our advertising revenues. The current ratings provided by Nielsen for use by broadcast stations are limited to live viewing Digital Video Recording playback and give broadcasters no credit whatsoever for viewing that occurs on a delayed basis after the original air date. However, the effects of new ratings system technologies, including \u2018\u2018people meters\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018set-top boxes,\u2019\u2019 and the ability of such technologies to be a reliable standard that can be used by advertisers is currently unknown. In 2010, the Media Rating Council, an independent organization that monitors rating services, revoked Nielsen\u2019s accreditation in the 154 markets it measures ratings exclusively by its diary methodology. We have 233 of our channels located in diary only markets as of December 31, 2014.\nSince digital television technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum, this technology could expose us to additional competition from programming alternatives. In addition, technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives, such as cable television, direct broadcast satellite systems, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems, video-on-demand, mobile video and the Internet have also created new types of competition to television broadcast stations and will increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. We cannot provide any assurances that we will remain competitive with these developing technologies.\nTypes of competitors\nWe also face competition from rivals that may have greater resources than we have. These include:\n\u00b7 other local free over-the-air broadcast television and radio stations;\n\u00b7 telecommunication companies;\n\u00b7 cable and satellite system operators;\n\u00b7 print media providers such as newspapers, direct mail and periodicals;\n\u00b7 internet search engines, internet service providers and websites; and\n\u00b7 other emerging technologies including mobile television.\nDeregulation\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 and subsequent actions by the FCC and the courts have removed some limits on station ownership, allowing telephone, cable and some other companies to provide video services in competition with us. In addition, the FCC has reallocated and auctioned off a portion of the spectrum for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services. As a result of these changes, new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us.\nWe could be adversely affected by labor disputes and legislation and other union activity.\nThe cost of producing and distributing entertainment programming has increased substantially in recent years due to, among other things, the increasing demands of creative talent and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. Although we generally purchase programming content from others rather than produce such content ourselves, our program suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and on-air and other talent, trade employees and others, some of whom are subject to these collective bargaining agreements. Also, as of February 23, 2015, approximately 800 of our employees, including certain new employees at the stations we acquired during 2014, are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. If we or our program suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Failure to renew these agreements, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by causing, among other things, delays in production that lead to declining viewers, a significant disruption of operations and reductions in the profit margins of our programming and the amounts we can charge advertisers for time. Our stations also broadcast certain professional sporting events, including NBA basketball games, MLB baseball games, NFL football games, and other sporting events, and our viewership may be adversely affected by player strikes or lockouts, which could adversely affect our advertising revenues and results of operations. Further, any changes in the existing labor laws, including the possible enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act, may further the realization of the foregoing risks.\nUnrelated third parties may bring claims against us based on the nature and content of information posted on websites maintained by us.\nWe host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. Claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our users. Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nCosts of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe cannot predict what other governmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future, how future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or how future laws or regulations will affect us. Compliance with new laws or regulations, including proposed legislation to address climate change, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to incur significant expenditures or impose significant restrictions on us and could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards can affect reported earnings and results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and accompanying pronouncements and implementation guidelines for many aspects of our business, including those related to intangible assets, pensions, income taxes, share-based compensation and broadcast rights, are complex and involve significant judgments. Changes in rules or their interpretation could significantly change our reported earnings and results of operations.\nTerrorism or armed conflict domestically or abroad may negatively impact our advertising revenues and results of operations. Future conflicts, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may have a similar effect.\nThe commencement of the war in Iraq in 2002 and activities in Afghanistan resulted in a reduction of advertising revenues as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and/or general economic uncertainty. If the United States becomes engaged in similar conflicts in the future, there may be a similar adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, any terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may have a similar negative effect on our business or results of operations.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corruption data, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.", "PERMNO": 81740, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "SBGI"}
