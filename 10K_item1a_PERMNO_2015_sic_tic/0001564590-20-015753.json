Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. All statements, other than statements of historical information, should be deemed to be forward-looking statements. The words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to, the risks set forth below. The risks described below are those that we have identified as material and is not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below. If any events occur that give rise to the following risks, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. These risk factors, some of which are beyond our control or not readily predictable, should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Investors are cautioned not to put undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $393.4 million of total debt (excluding debt issuance costs, debt discounts and capital lease obligations), consisting of $392.8 million of the Senior Secured Notes and $0.6 million of financed vehicles. Our indebtedness requires significant interest and principal payments. Since December 31, 2019, we have redeemed an aggregate of $31.3 million of principal on the Senior Secured Notes, primarily with the net proceeds from the Oakmont Sale, and we anticipate using the first $23.7 million of net proceeds and 80% of the remaining net proceeds from the Olivet Sale along with 80% of the net proceeds from the Remaining California Sale to redeem additional portions of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. Under the Indenture, we are obligated to pay a 2.0% premium for future redemptions of the principal of the Senior Secured Notes in excess of $23.7 million. We have the right and expect to pay quarterly interest at a fixed rate of 7.50% per annum in cash plus a fixed rate of 4.00% per annum payable in kind through January 30, 2022. The Senior Secured Notes will require cash interest payments at 9.875% for all interest periods after January 30, 2022.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and any future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the Indenture prohibits us from incurring additional debt or liens for working capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes (subject to very limited exceptions), requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity level on a rolling ten business day basis and requires us to meet minimum interest and asset coverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to repay our indebtedness and comply with the restrictive and financial maintenance covenants will be dependent on, among other things, the successful execution of our strategic plans. If we require additional\ncapacity under the restrictive covenants to successfully execute our strategic plans or if we are unable to comply with the financial maintenance covenants, we will need to seek an amendment from a majority of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such an amendment, and any failure to obtain such an amendment will have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results.\nOur ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take certain actions, including reducing spending on day-to-day operations, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. The trustee or holders of our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our debt.\nIn addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry could be impaired, and our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged, as these competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nThe prohibition on incurring additional debt in the Indenture for the Senior Secured Notes, as well as future operating results, may require us to issue additional equity securities to finance our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Any such equity issuance may be at a price less than the then-current market price, which would result in dilution to our stockholders\u2019 interest in us.\nThe Indenture prohibits us from incurring additional debt, including to fund working capital and capital expenditures, subject to very limited exceptions. This prohibition may require us to issue additional equity securities in order to provide us with sufficient cash to fund our working capital, liquidity and capital expenditure needs. There can be no assurance as to the price and terms on which such equity securities may be issued, and our stockholders\u2019 equity interest in us may be materially diluted. For example, under the Supplemental Indenture and the Axar Commitment, we agreed to use our best efforts to effectuate a rights offering with an exercise price per shares of $0.73 per share with aggregate proceeds of not less than $17.0 million. Except as set forth in the Axar Commitment, there can be no assurances that we will be able to issue additional equity on any terms, in which case we may not have sufficient cash to fund our working capital, liquidity and capital expenditure needs and we may be unable to comply with one or more of the financial maintenance covenants in the Indenture.\nWe must comply with covenants in the Indenture. Failure to comply with these covenants, which may result from events that are not within our control, may result in an Event of Default under the Indenture, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and on the trading price of our common shares.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Indenture restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, including working capital and other liquidity, or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, the Indenture requires us to comply with various affirmative covenants regarding, among other matters, maintenance and investment of trust funds and trust accounts into which certain sales proceeds are required by law to be deposited, minimum liquidity and other covenants. The Indenture also includes other restrictive and financial maintenance covenants including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ncovenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to:\n\u25aa\nincur additional indebtedness, including entering into a working capital facility;\n\u25aa\ngrant liens;\n\u25aa\nengage in certain sale/leaseback, merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions;\n\u25aa\nmake certain investments;\n\u25aa\npay dividends or make distributions;\n\u25aa\nengage in affiliate transactions;\n\u25aa\namend our organizational documents; and\n\u25aa\nmake capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\ncovenants that require us to maintain:\n\u25aa\na minimum liquidity level on a rolling ten business day basis;\n\u25aa\na minimum interest coverage ratio on a trailing twelve month basis as of each fiscal quarter end; and\n\u25aa\na minimum asset coverage ratio as of each fiscal quarter end.\nThe Indenture also provides for certain events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which could, subject to certain conditions, cause all amounts owing under the Senior Secured Notes to become due and payable, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour failure to pay any interest on any senior secured note when it becomes due and payable that remains uncured for five business days;\n\u2022\nour failure to pay the principal on any of the senior secured notes when it becomes due and payable, whether at the due date thereof, at a date fixed for redemption, by acceleration or otherwise;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the agreements and covenants relating to maintenance of our legal existence, providing notice of any default or event of default or use of proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes or any of the restrictive or financial maintenance covenants in the Indenture;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with any other agreements or covenants contained in the Indenture or certain other agreements executed in connection with the Indenture that remains uncured for a period of 15 days after the earlier of written notice and request for cure from the Trustee or holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes;\n\u2022\nthe acceleration of, or the failure, to pay at final maturity indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured Notes) in a principal amount exceeding $5.0 million;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Indenture);\n\u2022\ncertain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving an Issuer or any subsidiary; and\n\u2022\nour failure to maintain one or more licenses, permits or similar approvals for the conduct of our business where the sum of the revenue associated therewith represents the lesser of (i) 15% of the Partnership\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 consolidated revenue and (ii) $30.0 million, and such breach is not cured within 30 days.\nAt the option of holders holding a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (and automatically upon any default for failure to pay principal of the Senior Secured Notes when due and payable or certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving an Issuer), the interest rate on the Senior Secured Notes will increase to 13.50% per annum, payable in cash.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the Indenture may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions and global health concerns. As a result of changes in market or other economic conditions, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired.\nIf we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our Indenture, or fail to pay amounts thereunder when due, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes will be able to accelerate the maturity of all amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes and demand repayment of amounts outstanding. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and the failure to make such payments would have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. Additionally, any subsequent replacement of our debt obligations or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur ability to execute our strategic plans depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur strategic plans are focused on efforts to revitalize the business, grow our revenue and manage our operating and non-recurring operating expenses. Many of the factors that impact our ability to execute our strategic plans, such as the number of deaths and general economic conditions, are beyond our control. Changes in operating conditions, such as supply disruptions and labor disputes, could negatively impact our operations. If we are unable to leverage scale to drive cost savings, productivity improvements, pre-need production or anticipated earnings growth, or if we are unable to deploy capital to maximize stockholder value, our financial performance could be affected. If we are unable to identify divestitures as planned or to realize expected synergies and strategic benefits, our financial performance could also be affected. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to execute any or all of our strategic plans. Failure to execute any or all of our strategic plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn April 2019, we outlined and began implementing a turnaround strategy to return to profitability that is focused on four key goals: cash flow and liquidity, capital structure, strategic balance sheet/portfolio review and performance improvement from cost reductions and revenue enhancement. The turnaround strategy may negatively impact our operations, which could include\ndisruptions from the realignment of operational functions within the home office, sales of selected properties, changes in the administrative reporting structure and changes in our product assortments or marketing strategies. The impact of these disruptions may be material, and these changes could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. These changes could also decrease the cash we have available to fund ongoing liquidity and working capital requirements, and we may experience periods of limited liquidity. In addition, we are currently not generating sufficient consistent cash flow to cover the interest payments on our debt and meet our operating liquidity needs. If our turnaround strategy is not successful, takes longer than initially projected or is not executed effectively, our business operations, financial results, liquidity and cash flow will be adversely affected. Furthermore, no assurances can be given that our turnaround strategy, even if implemented properly, will result in a return to profitability.\nWe are under leadership of a new Board of Directors, who collectively have a limited operating history with us.\nIn June 2019, in connection with the Recapitalization Transactions (as defined in Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Events), our Board of Directors was reconstituted. Directors Martin R. Lautman, Ph.D., Leo J. Pound, Robert A. Sick and Fenton R. Talbott resigned as directors and the authorized number of directors was reduced to seven. Andrew Axelrod, David Miller and Spencer Goldenberg were elected as directors to fill the vacancies created by the resignations. The reconstituted Board of Directors is comprised of Messrs. Axelrod, Miller and Goldenberg, Robert Hellman, Stephen Negrotti, Patricia Wellenbach and Joe Redling. Certain of our new board members have limited experience with our management team and our business. The ability of our new directors to quickly understand our business plans, operations and turnaround strategies will be critical to their ability to make informed and effective decisions about our strategy and operations, particularly given the competitive environment in which our business operates.\nCemetery burial practice claims could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur cemetery practices have evolved and improved over time. Most of our cemeteries have been operating for decades and may have used practices and procedures that are outdated in comparison to today's standards. When cemetery disputes occur, we may be subject to litigation and liability for improper burial practices, including:\n\u2022\nburial practices of a different era that are judged today in hindsight as being outdated; and\n\u2022\nalleged violations of our practices and procedures by one or more of our associates.\nIn addition, since most of our cemeteries were acquired through various acquisitions, we may be subject to litigation and liability based upon actions or events that occurred before we acquired or managed the cemeteries. Claims or litigation based upon our cemetery burial practices could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to generate pre-need sales depends on a number of factors, including sales incentives and local and general economic conditions.\nSignificant declines in pre-need sales would reduce our backlog and revenue and could reduce our future market share. On the other hand, a significant increase in pre-need sales could have a negative impact on cash flow as a result of commissions and other costs incurred initially without corresponding revenue.\nWe are continuing to refine the mix of service and product offerings in both our funeral and cemetery segments, including changes in our sales commission and incentive structure. These changes could cause us to experience declines in pre-need sales in the short-run. In addition, economic conditions at the local or national level could cause declines in pre-need sales either as a result of less discretionary income or lower consumer confidence. Declines in pre-need cemetery property sales reduce current revenue, and declines in other pre-need sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share.\nPre-need sales typically generate low or negative cash flow in the periods immediately following sales, which could adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.\nWhen we sell cemetery merchandise and services on a pre-need basis, upon cash collection, we pay commissions on the sale to our salespeople and are required by state law to deposit a portion of the sales proceeds into a merchandise trust. In addition, most of our customers finance their pre-need purchases under installment contracts payable over a number of years. Depending on the trusting requirements of the states in which we operate, the applicable sales commission rates and the amount of the down payment, our cash flow from sales to customers through installment contracts is typically negative until we have collected the related receivable or until we purchase the products or perform the services and are permitted to withdraw funds\nwe have deposited in the merchandise trust. To the extent we increase pre-need sales, state trusting requirements are increased or we delay the performance of the services or delivery of merchandise we sell on a pre-need basis, our cash flow from pre-need sales may be further reduced, and our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability and positive cash flow.\nWe have incurred negative cash flows from operations and net losses for several years and have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019, due to an increased competitive environment, increased expenses due to the C-Corporation Conversion and increases in professional fees and compliance costs. To the extent that we continue to have negative operating cash flow in future periods, we may not have sufficient liquidity and we may not be able to successfully implement our turnaround strategy. We cannot predict if or when we will operate profitably and generate positive cash flows.\nOur merchandise and perpetual care trust funds own investments in equity securities, fixed income securities, mutual funds and master limited partnerships, which are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nPursuant to state law, a portion of the proceeds from pre-need sales of merchandise and services is put into merchandise trusts until such time that we meet the requirements for releasing trust principal, which is generally delivery of merchandise or performance of services. In addition, the Indenture also provides certain limitations on how the assets in the merchandise trusts may be invested. Generally, a majority of the investment earnings generated by the assets in the merchandise trusts, including realized gains and losses, are deferred until the associated merchandise is delivered or the services are performed.\nAlso, pursuant to state law, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of cemetery property is required to be paid into perpetual care trusts. The perpetual care trust principal does not belong to us and must remain in this trust in perpetuity while interest and dividends may be released and used to defray cemetery maintenance costs.\nThese trust assets are managed by a trustee, which is advised by Cornerstone, our registered investment adviser subsidiary, all under the oversight of the Trust and Compliance Committee of our Board. Cornerstone has engaged two outside sub-advisers to assist Cornerstone in providing investment recommendations with respect to certain trust assets. There is no guarantee that the trustee will achieve its objectives and deliver adequate returns, and the trustee\u2019s investment choices may result in losses. In addition our returns on these investments are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control. If the investments in our trust funds experience significant declines, there could be insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the costs of delivering services and merchandise. Pursuant to state law, we may be required to cover any such shortfall in merchandise trusts with cash flows from operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from investment returns that we realize from merchandise and perpetual care trusts. Unstable economic conditions have, at times, caused us to experience declines in the fair value of the assets held in these trusts. Moreover future cash flows could be negatively impacted if we are forced to liquidate any such investments that are in an impaired position.\nIf the fair market value of these trusts, plus any other amount due to us upon delivery of the associated contracts, were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services, we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contracts.\nFor more information related to our trust investments, see Note 7, Merchandise Trusts and Note 8, Perpetual Trusts to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report.\nWe may be required to replenish our funeral and cemetery trust funds in order to meet minimum funding requirements, which would have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flow.\nIn certain states, we have withdrawn allowable distributable earnings from our merchandise trusts, including gains prior to the maturity or cancellation of the related contract. Additionally, some states have laws that either require replenishment of investment losses under certain circumstances or impose various restrictions on withdrawals of future earnings when trust fund values drop below certain prescribed amounts. In the event of realized losses or market declines, we may be required to deposit portions or all of these amounts into the respective trusts in some future period. As of December 31, 2019, we had unrealized losses of approximately $4.2 million in the various trusts within these states, of which $3.1 million were in merchandise trust accounts and $1.1 million were in perpetual care trust accounts.\nAny reductions in the earnings of the investments held in merchandise and perpetual care trusts could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nWe invest our trust assets primarily for generation of realized income. We rely on the earnings, interest and dividends paid by the assets in our trusts to provide both revenue and cash flow. Interest income from fixed-income securities is particularly susceptible to changes in interest rates and declines in credit worthiness while dividends from equity securities are susceptible to the issuer\u2019s ability to make such payments. Declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenue, while declines in earnings from other trust funds could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenue.\nUnfavorable publicity could affect our reputation and business.\nSince our operations relate to life events that are emotionally stressful for our client families, our business is dependent on customer trust and confidence. Unfavorable publicity about our business generally or in relation to any specific location could affect our reputation and customers\u2019 trust and confidence in our products and services, thereby having an adverse impact upon our sales and financial results.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified sales personnel and management could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain a qualified sales force and other personnel is an important factor in achieving future success. Buying cemetery and funeral home products and services, especially at-need products and services, is very emotional for most customers, so our sales force must be particularly sensitive to our customers\u2019 needs. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain a skilled sales force. If we are unable to maintain a qualified and productive sales force, our revenues may decline and our cash available for distribution may decrease.\nOur success also depends upon the services and capabilities of our management team. Management establishes the \"tone at the top\" by which an environment of ethical values, operating style and management philosophy is fostered. The inability of our senior management team to maintain a proper \"tone at the top\" or the loss of services of one or more members of senior management, as well as the inability to attract qualified managers or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available. We do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers.\nFailure to effectively identify and manage divestitures and acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we launched an asset sale program designed to divest assets at attractive multiples, reduce debt levels and improve our cash flow and liquidity. As of April 1, 2020, execution of this program has resulted in the consummation of the Oakmont Sale in January 2020 and the execution of two separate asset purchase agreements for the Olivet Sale and the Remaining California Sale in March 2020. However, we may not be successful in identifying additional divestiture opportunities on terms acceptable to us and the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect our earnings.\nIn addition, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that could strategically fit our business objectives. However, we may not be successful in identifying and acquiring cemeteries or funeral homes on terms favorable to us or at all and may face competition from other death care companies in making acquisitions. In addition, if we complete acquisitions, we may encounter various associated risks, including the inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations, diversion of management\u2019s attention and unanticipated problems or liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Moreover, if we acquire cemeteries that do not have an existing pre-need sales program or a significant amount of pre-need products and services that have been sold but not yet purchased or performed, the operation of the cemetery and implementation of a pre-need sales program after acquisition may require significant amounts of working capital.\nWe are also limited by our Indenture, which prohibits us from incurring additional debt or liens for acquisitions and engaging in certain asset sale transactions (subject to very limited exceptions), as well as restricts our use of proceeds from asset sale transactions.\nIf our execution and implementation of divestitures and acquisitions is unsuccessful, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected. We may also incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures or acquisitions that would reduce our earnings.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements and may adversely affect our liquidity, the market for our common shares and our business.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 13a-15(f), respectively, under the Exchange Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely, reliable and accurate financial reports, identify and proactively correct any deficiencies, material weaknesses or fraud and meet our reporting obligations. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our independent registered public accounting firm also expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have commenced our remediation efforts as discussed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, which may include replacing and or enhancing our accounting systems in order to better perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If accounting systems are not successfully implemented or we encounter other difficulties, we might incur significant unexpected expenses in order to perform the Section 404 evaluation and our ability to file timely with the SEC may be adversely impacted. In addition, if our remedial measures are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls occur in the future, we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses or deficiencies, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nOur ability to manage and maintain our internal reports effectively and integrate new business acquisitions depends significantly on our operational technology platform and other information systems. Some of our information technology systems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems and corruption of data. The failure of our systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems or a breach in security or other unauthorized access of these systems may also result in reduced efficiency of our operations and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach and to comply with applicable regulations, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers, their loved ones, our employees and our vendors could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial additional costs and make us subject to litigation, all of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flow.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive certain personal information, in both physical and electronic formats, about our customers, their loved ones, our employees and our vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting electronic payments. We maintain security measures and data backup systems to protect, store and prevent unauthorized access to such information. However, it is possible that computer hackers and others (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, their loved ones, our employees and our vendors that we hold. In addition, our employees, contractors or third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach, corruption or data loss involving such information. A breach of our security measures or failure in our backup systems could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and their loved ones, our employees and our vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. It could also result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations.\nThe financial condition of third-party insurance companies that fund our pre-need funeral contracts and the amount of benefits those policies ultimately pay may impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWhere permitted, customers may arrange their pre-need funeral contract by purchasing a life insurance or annuity policy from third-party insurance companies. The customer/policy holder assigns the policy benefits to our funeral home to pay for the pre-need funeral contract at the time of need. For the sales of pre-need funeral contracts funded through life insurance policies, we receive commissions from third-party insurance companies. Additionally, there is a death benefit associated with the contract that may vary over the contract life. There is no guarantee that the value of the death benefit will increase or cover future increases in the cost of providing a funeral service. If the financial condition of the third-party insurance companies were to deteriorate materially because of market conditions or otherwise, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to collect all or part of the proceeds of the life insurance or annuity policy, including any increase in the death benefit. Failure to collect such proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur liquidity may be impacted by our ability to negotiate bonding arrangements with third-party insurance companies.\nWhere permitted, we may enter into bonding arrangements with insurance companies, whereby pre-need performance obligations otherwise required to be trusted may be insured through a process called bonding. In the event that we are unable to deliver on bonded pre-need contract sales at the time of need, the insurance company will provide cash sufficient to deliver goods for the respective pre-need sale item. On an ongoing basis, we must negotiate acceptable terms of these various bonding arrangements, and the insurance company may require us to provide cash collateral from time to time under certain circumstances. To the extent we are unable to negotiate acceptable terms for such arrangements and thus are no longer able to maintain existing bonds, we would need to deposit the corresponding amounts in the merchandise trusts. In addition, the insurance companies may increasingly require us to provide cash collateral for such surety bonds in light of our financial condition. We may be required to provide additional cash collateral from time to time under certain circumstances. Any of these actions would have an adverse impact on our liquidity.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nFrom time to time, we are party to various claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, claims and proceedings regarding employment, cemetery or burial practices and other litigation. As set forth more fully in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies of this Annual Report, we are currently subject to state law claims that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to the Company. We could also become subject to additional claims and legal proceedings relating to the factual allegations made in these actions. We are also subject to class or collective actions under the wage and hours provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, including, but not limited to, national and state class or collective actions, or putative class or collective actions.\nAdverse outcomes in some or all of our pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, as litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties. Any such adverse outcomes, in pending cases or other lawsuits that may arise in the future, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. While we hold insurance policies that may reduce cash outflows with respect to adverse outcomes of certain litigation matters, these insurance policies exclude certain claims, such as claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nIn addition, litigation claims and legal proceedings could demand substantial amounts of our management\u2019s time, resulting in the diversion of our management resources from effectively managing our business operations, and costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings could be material. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation. All these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our Net Operating Losses and other tax assets is uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $423.0 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and substantial similar tax assets at the federal and state levels. Along with other previous transfers of our interests, we believe the Recapitalization Transactions caused an \u201cownership change\u201d for income tax purposes, which may significantly limit our ability to use NOLs and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, possibly reducing the amount of cash available to us to satisfy our obligations.\nA number of years may elapse before particular tax matters, for which we have established accruals, are audited and finally resolved.\nWe are subject to federal income tax laws and state tax laws. The number of tax years open to audit varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The federal statutes of limitations have expired for all tax years prior to 2016, and we are not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Various state jurisdictions are conducting sales tax audits from years 2015 to 2019 and escheat audits from year 2005 to present day. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. However, unfavorable settlement of any particular issue may reduce a deferred tax asset or require the use of cash, which may have a material adverse impact to our financial statements. Favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense reported in the financial statements in the future. For further details, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12 Income Taxes of this Annual Report.\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nWe make judgments regarding the utilization of existing income tax credits and the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. Tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results, or adverse tax rulings on positions taken could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to the Partnership\u2019s income tax returns for 2018 or 2019 tax years, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for our 2018 and 2019 tax years, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to the Partnership\u2019s income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. To the extent possible under the new rules, we may elect to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised Schedule K-1 to each holder of the Partnership\u2019s common units during the applicable year with respect to an unaudited and adjusted return. Although we may elect to have such unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in the Partnership during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance the election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, StoneMor Inc. may be required to pay the necessary taxes, which would mean that our current stockholders may indirectly bear some or all of the impact of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if they did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and/or interest, our financial condition could be adversely affected. These rules were not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nThe cemetery and funeral home industry continues to be competitive, and if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences, our market share, revenues and profitability could decrease.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on our management\u2019s forward vision, timely responses to changes in the business environment and the ability of our cemeteries and funeral homes to maintain a good reputation and high professional standards as well as offer products and services at competitive prices. If we are unable to compete successfully, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe experience price competition from independent funeral service location and cemetery operators, monument dealers, casket retailers, low-cost funeral providers and other nontraditional providers of merchandise and services. New market entrants tend to attempt to build market share by offering lower cost alternatives. In the past, this price competition has resulted in our losing market share in some markets. In other markets, we have had to reduce prices or offer discounts, thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share. Independent competitors tend to be aggressive in distinguishing themselves by their independent ownership, and they promote their independence through television, radio and print advertising, direct mailings and personal contact. Increasing pressures from new market entrants and continued advertising and marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenue. In addition, competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered. These changes may attract customers, causing us to lose market share\nand revenue as well as to incur costs in response to this competition. Increased use of the internet by customers to research and/or purchase products and services could also have an adverse impact upon our sales and financial results.\nFuture market share, revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences ahead of and/or better than our competitors. In addition, any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions caused by global health concerns and other crises could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nGlobal health concerns, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic, could result in social, economic and labor instability that adversely affect our employee and customer relationships, pre-need sales activity, the value of our trust investments and associated funding obligations, and in so doing adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, governmental actions restricting public gatherings and interaction may result in our customers deferring making purchase decisions regarding pre-need arrangements or delay holding funeral services and may result in our inability to operate our cemeteries and funeral homes, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our pre-need customers with installment contracts could default on their installment contracts due to lost work or other financial stresses arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Having to adjust our policies and practices to respond to global health concerns could also result in increased operating expenses. We continue to monitor this public health crisis and its impact on our employees, customers and vendors and the overall economic environment within the U.S. and worldwide, but we cannot presently predict the full scope and severity of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause fixed costs are inherent in our business, a decrease in our revenues can have a disproportionate effect on our cash flow and profits.\nOur business requires us to incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period. For example, we must pay salaries, utilities, property taxes and maintenance costs on our cemetery properties and funeral homes regardless of the number of interments or funeral services we perform. If we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales, declines in sales can cause our margins, profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in our revenues.\nIf the trend toward cremation in the U.S. continues, our revenues may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe and other death care companies that focus on traditional methods of interment face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the U.S. Industry studies1 indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased. In 2018, the U.S. cremation rate was 53%, with an annual growth rate from 2013 to 2018 of 1.58%. This percentage is expected to increase to 59% by 2023. Because the products and services associated with cremations, such as niches and urns, produce lower revenues than the products and services associated with traditional interments, a continuing trend toward cremation may reduce our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, sales related to cremations represented 7% and 5%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.\nDeclines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues.\nDeclines in the number of deaths could cause at-need sales of cemetery and funeral home merchandise and services to decline and could cause a decline in the number of pre-need sales, both of which could decrease revenues. Changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter, and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable. Generally, the number of deaths may fluctuate depending on weather conditions and illness.\nRegulation and compliance could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trusts/escrows, pre-need sales, cemetery ownership, funeral home ownership, marketing practices, crematories, environmental matters and various other aspects of our business. For example, the funeral industry is regulated at the federal level by the FTC, which requires funeral service locations to take actions designed to\nIndustry statistics were compiled by the Cremation Association of North America.\nprotect consumers. Our facilities are also subject to stringent health, safety, and environmental regulations. Our pay practices, including wage and hour overtime pay, are also subject to federal and state regulations. Violations of applicable laws could result in fines or sanctions against us. We may experience significant increases in costs as a result of business regulations and laws, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. Although we seek to control increases in these costs, continued upward pressure on costs could reduce the profitability of our business.\nState laws impose licensing requirements and regulate pre-need sales. As such, we are subject to state trust fund and pre-need sales practice audits, which could result in audit adjustments as a result of non-compliance. In addition, we assume the liability for any audit adjustments for our acquired businesses for periods under audit prior to our ownership of these acquired businesses. These audit adjustments could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, from time to time, governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations or reinterpret existing regulations, which could increase costs and decrease cash flows. For example, foreign, federal, state, local, and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the deathcare industry. These include regulations that require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for pre-need sales of products and services, limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding, require the escheatment of trust funds, increase trust requirements, require the deposit of funds or collateral to offset unrealized losses of trusts, and/or prohibit the common ownership of funeral service locations and cemeteries in the same market. If adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate, these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompliance with laws, regulations, industry standards, and customs concerning burial procedures and the handling and care of human remains is critical to the continued success of our business. We continually monitor and review our operations in an effort to ensure that we take the right actions necessary to remaining in compliance with these laws, regulations and standards. However, litigation and regulatory proceedings regarding these issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nFor additional information regarding the regulation of the funeral and cemetery industry, see Part I, Item 1. Business, Regulation of this Annual Report.\nWe are subject to legal restrictions on our marketing practices that could reduce the volume of our sales, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe enactment or amendment of legislation or regulations relating to marketing activities may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. For example, the federal \"do not call\" legislation has adversely affected our ability to market our products and services using telephone solicitation, by limiting whom we may call and increasing our costs of compliance. As a result, we rely heavily on direct mail marketing and telephone follow-up with existing contacts. Additional laws or regulations limiting our ability to market through direct mail, over the telephone, through Internet and e-mail advertising or door-to-door may make it difficult to identify potential customers, which could increase our costs of marketing. Both increases in marketing costs and restrictions on our ability to market effectively could reduce our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nRISK FACTORS RELATED TO OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK\nAxar holds a majority of the voting power of our common stock.\nAxar Capital Management L.P. and its affiliates (collectively, \u201cAxar\u201d) beneficially owns more than 52% of our outstanding common stock and, as a result, has the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors other than one director whose nomination and election is the subject of a separate voting agreement. In addition, it will be able to determine the outcome of all other matters requiring stockholder approval, including certain mergers and other material transactions, and will be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company. So long as Axar continues to own a significant amount of our outstanding shares, even if such amount is less than 50%, it will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that the transaction is in their own best interests. Axar\u2019s ownership interest also makes us a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) listing standards. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, consistent with the listing standards applicable to companies that are not controlled companies, require that a majority of our directors and all of the members of our Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee be independent within the meaning of those standards. However, we can amend our Corporate Governance Guidelines in our\nBoard\u2019s discretion, and as a controlled company, we are not subject to the requirement that a majority of our directors and all of the members of our Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee be independent.\nEconomic, financial and stock market fluctuations could affect future potential earnings and cash flows and could result in future intangible asset and long-lived asset impairments.\nIn addition to an annual review, we assess the impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value and therefore not fully recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flow, undiscounted and without interest, expected to be generated by the assets. Factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in the market value of our stock or debt values, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. In 2019, we determined that the continued decline of our sales during 2019 was a triggering event that warranted an impairment assessment of our definite-lived and long-lived intangible assets. Based on the results of our interim goodwill impairment assessment for the third quarter of 2019, we concluded our goodwill was fully impaired as of September 30, 2019, and recorded a loss on goodwill impairment of $24.9 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Based on the results of our impairment tests of our long-lived assets throughout 2019, we concluded certain of our long-lived assets were impaired by a total of $2.9 million during year ended December 31, 2019, which was included in Other losses, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nDue to our continued high level of indebtedness and limited liquidity, we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
