RISK FACTORS\nAll phases of the Company\u2019s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are outside of its control, and any one or a combination of which could materially affect its results of operations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations are discussed below. Prospective investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in our securities as well as the information set forth under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 7 of this report. These risks and uncertainties include:\nCompetition from larger companies.\nThe Company competes with large national companies and numerous regional and local companies for franchise and license sales and with respect to its Company-owned locations. Many of its competitors have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The restaurant industry in general is intensely competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of several factors, including product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Activities of the Company\u2019s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses or maintain and renew existing franchises and licenses or the operating results of the Company\u2019s system. Unlike the other non-traditional agreements, most of the take-n-bake license agreements with grocery stores are not for any specified period of time and, therefore, grocery stores could discontinue offering the take-n-bake pizza or other retail items at any time. As a result of these factors, the Company may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time or in certain markets.\nDependence on growth strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategies include selling new franchises or licenses for non-traditional locations and to expand Craft Pizza & Pub locations by franchising to qualified franchisees and gradually increasing the number of Company-owned Craft Pizza & Pub locations. The opening and success of new locations will depend upon various factors, which include: (1) the traffic generated by and viability of the underlying activity or business in non-traditional locations; (2) the viability of the Craft Pizza & Pub locations;(3)the ability of the franchisees and licensees of either venue to operate their locations effectively; (4)the franchisee's ability to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and (5) the effect of competition and general economic and business conditions including food and labor costs. Many of the foregoing factors are not within the Company\u2019s control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its plans with respect to the opening and/or operation of new franchises/licenses for Craft Pizza & Pub or non-traditional locations.\nDependence on success of franchisees and licensees.\nWhile an increasing portion of its revenues are being generated by Company-owned operations, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues continues to come from royalties and other fees generated by its franchisees and licensees which are independent operators, and their employees are not the Company\u2019s employees. The Company is dependent on the franchisees to accurately report their weekly sales and, consequently, the calculation of royalties. If the franchisees do not accurately report their sales, the Company\u2019s revenue could decline. The Company provides training and support to franchisees and licensees but the quality of the store operations and collectability of the receivables may be diminished by a number of factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Consequently, franchisees and licensees may not operate locations in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If they do not, the Company\u2019s image and reputation may suffer, and its revenues and stock price could decline. While the Company attempts to ensure that its franchisees and licensees maintain the quality of its brand and branded products, franchisees and licensees may take actions that adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or reputation. Initiatives to increase the Federal minimum wage and/or shortage of available labor could have an adverse financial effect on our franchisees/licensees or the Company by increasing the labor cost.\nDependence on distributors.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s license and franchise offerings depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to engage and retain unrelated, third-party distributors. The Company\u2019s distributors collect and remit certain of the Company\u2019s royalties and must reliably stock and deliver products to the Company\u2019s licensees and franchisees. The Company\u2019s inability to engage and retain quality distributors, or a failure by distributors to perform in accordance with the Company\u2019s standards, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nDependence on consumer preferences and perceptions.\nThe restaurant industry and the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. The Company could be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from food quality, illness, injury, other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or retail outlet or a limited number of restaurants and retail outlets.\nAbility to service or refinance our outstanding indebtedness and the dilutive effect of our outstanding convertible debt and warrants.\nThe Company has substantial debt obligations. At December 31, 2018, the total debt was approximately $7 million. The outstanding debt includes $2 million of indebtedness evidenced by convertible, subordinated promissory notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) the Company issued, along with certain warrants exercisable for the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cWarrants\u201d), in a private placement in 2016 and 2017 (the \u201cOffering\u201d). Generally, the Notes mature, and the Warrants expire, three years after issuance. However, in December 2018, the Company offered to extend the maturity of the Notes and the expiration date of the Warrants to January 2023. Certain of the holders of the Notes and Warrants accepted the Company\u2019s offer. Accordingly, of the principal amount of the Notes, $700,000 matures in late 2019, $650,000 matures in January 2020 and $650,000 matures in January 2023. Included in the January 2020 maturity at December 31, 2018 is a $50,000 Note which was converted, in January 2019, to common stock consistent with the terms of the Agreement.\nThe Company is prohibited, by its loan agreement with its senior debt lender, from repaying the Notes as long as its senior debt is outstanding. In order to meet the maturity schedules above in late 2019 and early 2020, the Notes must either be converted to common stock, extended beyond the maturity of the senior debt or replaced with other like securities. The Company may not be able to accomplish any of those alternatives. The Company intends to extend or refinance with external capital the Notes maturing in 2019 and 2020. However, the Company may not be able to refinance its debt or sell additional debt or equity securities on favorable terms, or at all.\nAdditionally, the issuance of shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Company\u2019s outstanding Notes or the exercise of the Warrants issued in connection with the sale of the Notes would have a dilutive effect on its stockholders.\nInterruptions in supply or delivery of food products.\nDependence on frequent deliveries of product from unrelated third-party manufacturers through unrelated third-party distributors also subjects the Company to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by contractual interruptions, market conditions, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. In addition, factors such as inflation, market conditions for cheese, wheat, meats, paper, labor and other items may also adversely affect the franchisees and licensees and, as a result, can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to add new franchised or licensed locations.\nDependence on key executives.\nThe Company\u2019s business has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its executive staff generally, and particularly Paul W. Mobley, its Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and A. Scott Mobley, its President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFederal, state and local laws with regard to the operation of the businesses.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by the FTC and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company would be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchise units.\nEach franchise and Company-owned location is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, alcohol, employment and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a franchise location. Vendors, such as the Company\u2019s third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees and its vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations.\nIndiana law with regard to purchases of our stock.\nCertain provisions of Indiana law applicable to the Company could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of its common stock. These provisions include prohibitions against certain business combinations with persons or groups of persons that become \u201cinterested shareholders\u201d (persons or groups of persons who are beneficial owners of shares with voting power equal to 10% or more) unless the board of directors approves either the business combination or the acquisition of stock before the person becomes an \u201cinterested shareholder.\u201d\nInapplicability of corporate governance standards that apply to companies listed on a national exchange.\nThe Company\u2019s stock is quoted on the OTCQB, a Nasdaq-sponsored and operated inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities not included on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company is not subject to the same corporate governance requirements that apply to exchange-listed companies. These requirements include: (1) a majority of independent directors; (2) an audit committee of independent directors; and (3) shareholder approval of certain equity compensation plans or equity issuances. As a result, quotation of the Company\u2019s stock on the OTCQB limits the liquidity and price of its stock more than if its stock was quoted or listed on a national exchange. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s stock will continue to be authorized for quotation by the OTCQB or any other market in the future.", "PERMNO": 57753, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "NROM"}
