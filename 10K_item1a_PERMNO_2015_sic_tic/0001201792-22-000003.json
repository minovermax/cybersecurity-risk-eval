RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. As a result of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as such additional risks and uncertainties, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to adjust our operations, which could adversely affect the student experience, particularly at RU and HCN, and could have additional adverse effects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAs discussed more fully in \u201cOverview - COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted us to adjust our operations throughout our business, and we could experience additional impacts in the future if the pandemic and its effects are prolonged or increase in scope. At RU and HCN, ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt educational services provided to students and increase costs to continue to deliver courses in person and online. There can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent cases of COVID-19 among our employees and students, or that RU and HCN will not need to again further limit campus interactions or close campus operations. Our institutions continue to adjust their operations to respond to regularly changing government regulations and public health guidance. In addition, although we have leveraged the expertise of APUS and RU in online delivery of curriculum, we have limited experience delivering HCN\u2019s curriculum online, and in the event that HCN\u2019s students\u2019 academic studies move online, they may not experience the same level of success in online coursework or with NCLEX scores following online coursework as they would in a campus environment. While RU has more experience with online delivery of curriculum, RU\u2019s pre-licensure nursing programs have also been required to adjust their operations and in some cases move to a blended or online learning model, including with respect to practicum learning that would typically be done in a clinical or laboratory setting.\nNumerous challenges have arisen, or may arise, from adjustments to the learning experience as a result of COVID-19, including the shift to virtual learning. For example, some RU students have had to spend additional time enrolled because they have not have had the opportunity to obtain clinical experience during the expected or scheduled quarter of study due to a lack of clinical site availability. Retention for students decreased in the 2020-2021 reporting year, as compared to the 2019-2020 reporting year, which we believe in part is due to many students preferring not to take classes online due to the potential impact on their performance. Survey data indicates that students have also been impacted by challenges in signing on to virtual classes at home, providing childcare while remote schooling, and juggling education and employment or caring for ill family members during the pandemic, which we believe may have also impacted retention.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also placed pressure on the hiring and retention of qualified nursing faculty at RU and HCN due to the related demand for healthcare workers. For example, decreases in the permitted faculty to student ratio at clinical sites have increased the demand for faculty coverage to meet student needs at a time when qualified faculty are more difficult to hire and retain. Please refer to the Risk Factor that begins \u201cIf we are unable to attract, retain, and develop skilled personnel . . .\u201d below. We believe staffing pressures have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the size of new student cohorts and total enrollment at RU, as well as program outcomes.\nIn 2020, we experienced an increase in net course registrations at APUS and an increase in student enrollment at HCN, and RU similarly experienced an increase in its enrollments. We believe the increases were in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in demand for nursing education and a change in the competitive environment due to COVID-19. Recent trends at APUS and RU show a moderation in registration and enrollments, and we believe HCN could experience a similar situation. When the pandemic abates, we believe near-term demand for our programs could moderate further.\nChanges to our teaching methodology and other changes to our programs at HCN and RU, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse impact on the ability of HCN\u2019s and RU\u2019s graduates to obtain professional licensure, employment, or other outcomes, which could reduce our enrollments and revenue, limit our ability to offer educational programs, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nState boards of nursing generally require applicants for licensure to practice nursing to have successfully completed a nursing education program that is approved by the state board. As discussed more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, failure to satisfy a state board of nursing\u2019s relevant NCLEX pass rate can result in the state board taking adverse actions against the nursing program, including and up to withdrawal of approval. For example, HCN\u2019s ADN Program has been on provisional approval from the OBN since March 2017 due to not meeting the OBN pass rate standard for four consecutive years. Both HCN and RU monitor, assess, and implement changes designed to improve NCLEX scores over time in order to meet each state board\u2019s requirements, but there is no assurance that such changes will be successful or will not have negative effects on RU\u2019s nursing enrollments or HCN\u2019s overall enrollments. For example, HCN in past periods experienced lower than planned ADN program enrollments that we believe were at least partly associated with the implementation of new academic achievement and admissions requirements. In addition, we cannot be certain that factors beyond our control, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, will not have a negative impact on the student experience, student outcomes and NCLEX scores.\nIf RU\u2019s nursing graduates or HCN\u2019s graduates fail to obtain professional licensure or employment or experience other negative outcomes in their chosen fields of study, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes to our academic programs, we and our institutions could be exposed to litigation, including class-action litigation, claiming that we are at fault for such failure, which would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Adverse impacts on HCN or RU resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could also lead to an impairment of goodwill.\nCOVID-19-related relief laws and regulatory guidance contain provisions that could benefit some institutions more than others or that may be ambiguous or subject to change, we may have difficulty adjusting our systems to comply, and failure to comply could subject us to penalties.\nAs discussed more fully in \u201cOverview - COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d multiple laws passed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CARES Act, the CRRSAA and the ARPA, include provisions designed to provide relief to higher education institutions in connection with the pandemic through, among other things, HEERF. Among other provisions, these laws place certain conditions on and limit expenditure of HEERF funds. Our institutions\u2019 failure to comply with applicable provisions of these laws, including provisions related to funding and waivers of Title IV requirements, or with ED guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which contain ambiguities, could result in administrative sanctions including fines, restrictions on our ability to participate in Title IV programs, debarment and suspension, and liabilities under applicable law, such as the False Claims Act. The CARES Act and related ED guidance waive certain federal student financial aid requirements in connection with COVID-19 developments and, to the extent such waivers apply to our institutions, we may have difficulty adjusting our systems to comply with those waivers. In addition, ED guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic may change as the pandemic continues. We cannot predict what additional regulatory actions may be taken or legislation put in place in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or what impact such regulations or legislation may have on us or our institutions, if any.\nRisks Related to Attracting and Retaining Students\nOur success and financial performance depend on the effectiveness of our ability to attract students who persist in our institutions\u2019 programs.\nBuilding awareness and reputation among potential students of our institutions and the programs they offer is critical to our institutions\u2019 ability to attract new students. In order to maintain and increase our revenue and profits, our institutions must continue to attract new, qualified students in a cost-effective manner, and these students must remain active in our institutions\u2019 programs. In addition, because our institutions experience declines in their student populations as a result of graduation, transfers to other academic institutions, withdrawals, military deployments and other reasons, in order to grow we need to first attract sufficient students to replace those who have left. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our institutions\u2019 programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining qualified students in those programs include:\n\u2022changes and revisions to policies of the DoD and the various military services;\n\u2022challenges in maintaining strong relationships with military and military-affiliated communities;\n\u2022the emergence of more, and more successful, competitors, and alternative education models, including from military services and as a greater number of schools pursue online education;\n\u2022factors related to our institutions\u2019 marketing, including the costs of internet advertising and multi-faceted interactive marketing campaigns;\n\u2022challenges in designing marketing campaigns that successfully attract college-ready students;\n\u2022the reduced availability of, or higher interest rates and other costs associated with, Title IV loan funds or other sources of financial aid;\n\u2022performance problems with our institutions\u2019 online systems;\n\u2022our institutions\u2019 failure to maintain accreditation, state authorization, eligibility for Title IV programs or other sources of financial aid, or other approvals;\n\u2022increased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022investigations or litigation by government agencies, other regulators, or private parties that may limit our ability to operate or damage our reputation;\n\u2022challenges in maintaining a positive reputation among students, employers, and other stakeholders;\n\u2022student dissatisfaction with our institutions\u2019 services and programs;\n\u2022failure to develop, deliver and maintain a message or image that resonates well with our institutions\u2019 students;\n\u2022adverse publicity regarding us, our institutions, our competitors, or online or for-profit education generally;\n\u2022challenges related to dependence on a third-party and decreased control over messaging as a result of RU\u2019s reliance on Collegis LLC, or Collegis, for marketing services;\n\u2022challenges in maintaining, developing, and expanding GSUSA\u2019s customer relationships with the federal government and its employees, including as a result of challenges in marketing to the federal government;\n\u2022a decline in the acceptance of or demand for online education generally, including as the COVID-19 pandemic abates; and\n\u2022a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our institutions\u2019 programs or programs provided by for-profit schools generally.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop awareness and reputation of our institutions and the programs we offer, and to recruit and enroll students that persist in our programs over time, our enrollments will suffer and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively market our programs or expand into new markets, including by opening new campuses, our operating results would be negatively affected.\nOur marketing strategy for APUS traditionally focused on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military, military-affiliated, and public service communities. However, with limitations on access to military students, as discussed further below under the Risk Factor that begins \u201cIf APUS does not have strong relationships with, and access to, various military installations . . .\u201d and with a continued focus on efforts to attract students outside of the military, we must continue to focus on marketing channels that attract college-ready students unaffiliated with the military who perform well at APUS. However, we have experienced challenges attracting college-ready students unaffiliated with the military who perform well at APUS, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on a cost-effective basis.\nFurthermore, because APUS\u2019s tuition is generally lower than that of most of its competitors, it has fewer dollars to spend per student on marketing and advertising than they do. Nevertheless, APUS has tried to, and may in the future try to, implement new marketing tactics and channels, including those with which it has no experience, and which have no guarantee of success. For example, we increased marketing expenditures in fiscal year 2020, including to support a new advertising campaign focusing on affordability and return on investment for learners. If we are unable to develop and optimize marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness of our institutions and the programs we offer and their value propositions and are unable to enroll and retain qualified students in military and non-military markets, our enrollments would suffer, and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of RU and HCN depend, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase student enrollments in those institutions\u2019 programs. As part of our strategy to continue to build a national nursing platform, we intend to continue to open new campuses and other operating locations for RU and HCN, such as the new HCN campuses in Indianapolis, Indiana and Akron, Ohio that began operations in April 2020 and April 2021, respectively. Such actions require us to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals and to comply with any requirements from those agencies related to a new location. We continue to work on identifying the appropriate balance of academic achievement requirements, admissions requirements, and attracting appropriate students, as well as identifying and remediating the factors impacting enrollments, but cannot predict whether our initiatives and efforts will be successful over the long term. In addition, with the opening of new campuses, we have been and will be marketing in geographic areas in which RU and HCN did not previously have a campus. If in the future we are unable to effectively market RU\u2019s and HCN\u2019s programs, we may not be able to successfully maintain and increase those institutions\u2019 enrollments, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to, or suffer any delay in our ability to, obtain appropriate approvals and accreditations, open, and attract additional students to new campus locations, offer programs at new campuses in a cost-effective manner, identify appropriate clinical placements, or otherwise effectively manage the operations of newly established campuses, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, RU is currently subject to ED-imposed restrictions on new programs and locations in terms of Title IV program eligibility, which could limit or adversely affect RU\u2019s near-term growth opportunities, including restricting its ability to serve additional students. In addition, the inability to expand existing programs efficiently, or successfully, including as a result of constraints on our operations due to COVID-19, pursue new program initiatives, and add new campuses would harm our ability to grow our business and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIf APUS does not have strong relationships with, and access to, various military installations and installation education centers, our ability to maintain enrollments from military students and our future growth may be impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 63% of APUS\u2019s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment, and students participating in TA constituted approximately 45% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2021. We are highly dependent on our relationship with the military and its members, and our ability to attract and retain military service members as students. Because APUS relies on referrals and personal relationships for recruiting, impediments to access can have an adverse effect on maintaining and generating registrations from military students.\nGenerally, DoD prohibits educational institutions from holding office hours solely to provide counseling and former military members from accessing installations to represent an educational institution using government ID card privileges. This has adversely affected our efforts to support existing students and serve new students since the policy was implemented. Furthermore, the DoD MOU, which specifies terms and conditions of participation in TA and is discussed in more depth in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Department of Defense,\u201d and the related increased focus by DoD on relationships with and oversight of educational providers, or additional DoD restrictions, could lead to further adverse changes in the nature of our relationships with military installations and their education centers and our access to military service members.\nAn inability to maintain strong relationships with installation education centers and with military service members would have an adverse effect on APUS\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified students, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur student registrations and revenue have been adversely impacted and we could continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of the Army\u2019s transition from GoArmyEd to ArmyIgnitED.\nArmy service members participating in TA programs constituted approximately 16% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2021. APUS relies on the ability of the Army, and the other branches of the Armed Forces, to process service members\u2019 participation in TA programs, and from time to time, changes to processes have impacted the ability of service members to participate in those programs. For example, the Army in 2021 transitioned from its legacy system, GoArmyEd, to a new system, ArmyIgnitED, for soldiers to use to request TA. As described more fully in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview,\u201d this transition has been beset by delays and disruption of the Army\u2019s TA programs. Soldiers can continue to directly register for courses with the expectation TA could be retroactively applied for, and the Army created a process for soldiers to seek reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs incurred during ArmyIgnitED\u2019s unavailability. While the ArmyIgnitED system went live for soldiers seeking to use TA for courses at APUS on July 19, 2021, we continue to experience challenges related to system performance, process changes and software defects, and there is no assurance that the new portal will ever work correctly or efficiently or will not have continuing impacts on soldiers\u2019 ability to participate in the TA programs or receive funds under those programs. There was an adverse impact on registrations and revenue for the second and third quarters of 2021. The inability of soldiers to participate in TA programs, or continued or additional limitations on their ability to apply and participate, would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly because soldiers make up the largest group of TA participants at APUS. In addition, TA will have to be retroactively sought and obtained for soldiers who registered for courses during the period beginning March 8, 2021. As a result, it is possible that we could incur bad debt expenses if soldiers who expect to receive TA do not receive it and do not otherwise pay the tuition for their courses. The disruption to the Army\u2019s systems has also adversely impacted APUS\u2019s ability to invoice the Army for Army registrations and has adversely impacted accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $27.0 million, of which $18.2 million is older than 60 days from the course start date, was due from the Army due to the disruption caused by the transition to ArmyIgnitED.\nEnrollments and course registrations by active duty service members may be adversely affected by a variety of factors not directly related to education programs, including changes in military activity and budgets.\nEvents not directly related to education programs could lead to a reduction in registrations from students on active duty. For example, APUS experienced an increase in net course registrations in 2020, which was driven in part by active-duty service members, and which we believe may have been due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent trends at APUS show a moderation in registration and enrollments, and the end of the pandemic could adversely affect enrollments and course registrations by active duty service members. Large-scale personnel reductions or other significant drawdowns of U.S. active duty military forces would also likely have a negative effect on enrollment and course registrations. Increased operations and overseas deployments could also negatively impact the ability of certain active duty military students to pursue higher education, including due to increased demands on active duty service members and limited internet access associated with some deployments.\nMilitary budget cuts or constraints could negatively affect us by leading to force reductions or cuts to services and tools that we or APUS\u2019s students rely upon for recruitment, enrollment, access, and tuition assistance. Even temporary changes to military activity and budgets may adversely affect operations. For example, funding for the federal government or portions thereof, including the DoD, Department of Homeland Security and Coast Guard, lapsed and resulted in partial shutdowns in 2018 and 2019. Any future government shutdown could have a material adverse effect on APUS\u2019s enrollments.\nWe will remain subject to the risk of events that occur within and with respect to the military, even where they do not directly relate to the use of TA. Because of our dependence on active duty military students, changes that occur within and with respect to the military could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nDoD\u2019s MOU imposes extensive regulatory requirements on our institutions with respect to participation in DoD tuition assistance programs, and our revenue and number of students would decrease if our institutions are no longer able to receive funds under DoD tuition assistance programs or if tuition assistance is reduced, eliminated, or suspended.\nAs described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Defense\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations - Compliance Reviews,\u201d each institution participating in TA is party to an MOU outlining certain commitments and agreements in connection with accepting funds from TA. For example, the MOUs include an agreement to participate in the ICP in order to participate in TA. An institution that is found noncompliant with DoD requirements through the ICP and demonstrates an unwillingness to resolve a finding may be subject to a range of penalties from a written warning to termination of the institution\u2019s participation in TA. In November 2020, DoD found, in connection with the ICP, that APUS did not clearly articulate certain policies or clearly make certain disclosures, which resulted in APUS submitting a corrective action plan and evidentiary support, subsequent to which ED informed APUS that it had completed the review process and no further actions were required.\nFailure to comply with an MOU could result in an institution losing the ability to participate in TA. We also believe that in certain circumstances DoD may impose sanctions for failure to comply other than denying an institution the ability to participate in TA, including restricting student enrollment in tuition assistance programs, suspending an institution from enrolling new students, limiting access to military installations, subjecting the institution to heightened compliance oversight, or otherwise limiting an institution\u2019s ability to participate in TA. If we fail to comply with the requirements of an MOU, it could result in sanctions, up to losing the ability to participate in TA, that could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nStudents participating in TA constituted approximately 45% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2021. We do not know the scale or nature of future actions that may be taken with respect to TA, which could include eliminating those programs, reducing the funds, benefits, or level of reimbursement available thereunder, changing the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, enacting new restrictions on institutional participation or imposing other eligibility criteria on institutions, all of which could impact enrollments from service members. Other administrative changes to DoD programs could also have negative effects on our enrollments.\nChanges to eligibility requirements under TA have already occurred, and there could be additional changes to the programs in the future. For example, effective October 1, 2021, the funding for Navy service members was limited due to the increase in number of years of service before funds can be received. Additional changes to TA could occur due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes. For example, the failure of Congress to pass continuing resolutions has limited the release of funds at times in the past, such as during a 35-day partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 in which the Coast Guard suspended its TA program. Annual TA funding is limited and could be exhausted in any given year due\nto budget constraints or changes in demand or policy. For example, TA benefits available to sailors for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 were expected to be exhausted by the end of May 2019 as a result of increased demand, and effective May 28, 2019 the Navy ceased approving TA funds for eligible sailors until the start of the new government fiscal year, resulting in a significant negative impact on our results of operations for the third quarter of 2019. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent the Navy or other services will impose limitations on TA approvals in the future as a result of limited funding. Furthermore, we expect each military branch and the DoD to continually evaluate their approaches to education, including by launching or expanding their own institutions, as discussed in further detail in the Risk Factor that begins \u201cStrong competition in the military market...\u201d below, and such actions could have an impact on the funds available to service members to pursue their education at our institutions. Changes in funding allocations could have a material adverse effect on APUS\u2019s enrollments.\nIf we are no longer able to receive funds from TA, or if those programs are modified, reduced, eliminated, or temporarily suspended, our enrollments and revenue could be significantly reduced, which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201cOur student registrations and revenue have been adversely impacted and we could continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of the Army\u2019s transition from GoArmyEd to ArmyIgnitED\u201d above.\nChanges our institutions may make to their operations to improve the student experience and enhance their ability to identify and enroll students who are likely to succeed may adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, profitability, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have identified, and continue to work to identify, potential changes and initiatives that we believe will more effectively attract and enroll students who are ready for and who are likely to persist in our institutions\u2019 programs, support those students, and help improve their educational outcomes, including through changes to admissions, initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom and to strengthen the bond between APUS and its students, and changes to HCN\u2019s curriculum and academic achievement and course retake policies.\nAdditional initiatives may include the following:\n\u2022revising admissions standards and requirements;\n\u2022updates to the admissions process and procedures;\n\u2022implementing more stringent satisfactory academic progress standards;\n\u2022changing tuition costs and payment options; and\n\u2022altering our institutions\u2019 marketing efforts to target the appropriate prospective students.\nThese initiatives require significant time, energy, and resources, and may adversely impact our institutions\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, particularly in the near term. We may not succeed in achieving our objectives due to organizational, operational, regulatory, resource, or other constraints. If our efforts are not successful, we may experience reduced enrollment, increased expense, or other impacts on our business that materially and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Even if these initiatives successfully lead to the identification and enrollment of students who are likely to succeed and to improvements in student experience, they could result in adverse impacts on enrollments. Due to the many factors that can impact enrollments, we may not appropriately identify the cause of any adverse impacts, and therefore may not be able to appropriately modify our initiatives.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully adjust to future market demands by updating and expanding the content of existing programs and developing new programs, specializations, and modes of teaching on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our performance may be impaired.\nWe believe that our institutions need to continuously update and expand the content of their existing programs and develop new programs, specializations, and modes of teaching in order to continue to retain and attract qualified students. However, the updates and expansions of our institutions\u2019 existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by their accreditors, state regulators, ED, existing or prospective students, or employers. If we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our institutions may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, growth restrictions may be imposed on our institutions in connection with changes in ownership or otherwise that adversely impact our ability to adjust to future market demands. For example, RU is currently subject to ED-imposed restrictions on new programs and locations and on the number of students receiving Title IV who can be enrolled at RU. These restrictions could limit or adversely affect RU\u2019s growth opportunities, including restricting its\nability to serve additional students, particularly additional nursing students, and limiting its ability to continue to evolve to address current needs by providing new or modified programs. If we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations, or other factors, our institutions\u2019 ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs, specializations, and modes of teaching or modifying or eliminating existing programs requires our institutions to make investments in management, academic resources including faculty, and capital expenditures, incur marketing expenses, and reallocate other resources. Our institutions may have limited experience providing courses in new fields of study or new modes of teaching (such as micro-credentials, or other non-degree credentials) and may need to modify systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other institutions and organizations to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If our institutions are unable to establish new academic programs, increase the number of students enrolling in new academic programs, offer programs in a cost-effective manner, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of those programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited experience participating in the DoD\u2019s credentialing assistance programs, and increased use of credentialing assistance could have an adverse impact on our business strategy and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience and few current offerings in credentialing assistance. As a result, our ability to comply with related regulatory requirements and to enroll students in programs eligible for credentialing assistance remains uncertain, and we may not be as recognized as other providers in this area. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to enroll students in credentialing assistance programs could have an adverse effect on our plans to be competitive in the area of credentialing assistance at APUS.\nStudents in the Army may use both TA and credentialing assistance for the Army\u2019s expanded credentialing program called the Army Credentialing Assistance Program, subject to a combined cap on benefit amounts. As a result, soldiers who take advantage of one of these forms of assistance are limited in their ability to use the other form, which could adversely impact enrollments and our results of operations. Increased use of credentialing assistance in the Army could result in fewer funds being used or available for tuition assistance. We believe other service branches may also expand their credentialing programs or pursue other approaches to enhancing support for credentialing, such as the Coast Guard\u2019s Credentialing Assistance Program, but there can be no assurance that they will do so or that we will benefit as a result. For example, the DoD and military branches could move increasingly toward credentialing assistance as a preferred choice for soldiers, which could reduce funds available for TA and adversely impact enrollments and our results of operations, particularly if we are unsuccessful in developing our credentialing assistance offerings.\nContinued strong competition in the postsecondary education market could impact our institutions\u2019 market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.\nWithin the postsecondary education market, our institutions compete primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges, as well as other for-profit schools Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. These institutions may have instructional and support resources, or course delivery tools, that are superior to those of our institutions and other for-profit schools. Many of these competitors, whether for-profit, not-for-profit, or public, are also able to leverage their greater scale and size to compete more efficiently. Many of our competitors also have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students, or to provide instructional and support resources that are superior to those of our institutions and other for-profit schools. In addition, as indicated in the Risk Factor that begins \u201cStrong competition in the military market...\u201d below, the Armed Forces have established, and may in the future establish, their own postsecondary education programs. Within the nursing education market, we compete with other schools offering similar programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private college, that may have greater resources or a greater market presence or reputation in the local areas we serve. In addition, because of the relatively local focus of RU's and HCN\u2019s nursing programs, our competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific to the particular areas where our campuses are located, including local supply and demand dynamics for nurses and nursing schools. RU's and HCN\u2019s results are therefore more susceptible to the actions of single competitors than the results of an institution that draws from a broader geographical area. For example, a particularly effective or ineffective marketing approach by another school, or the opening or closing of another school, could have unanticipated detriments or benefits to RU's and HCN\u2019s competitive position.\nWithin the postsecondary education market generally, we have experienced increased competition, including the entrance of additional providers of online and non-traditional programs, a shift of for-profit institutions to not-for-profit status, and declines or slower growth in the total postsecondary student population. We operate 30 on-ground nursing campuses in\napproximately 20 markets where we compete with a mix of local career colleges and two- and four-year colleges. Because of the relatively local focus of these programs, our competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific not only to states where campuses are located but also to the particular areas where the campuses are located, including local supply and demand for nurses and nursing schools. Title IV postsecondary degree-granting institutions have experienced recent declines in enrollment, and primarily online institutions saw a decline in enrollment in the fall of 2021, reversing growth experienced in the fall of 2020. Longer term projections suggest that previous growth in enrollment in postsecondary degree-granting institutions is slowing. The combination of reduced growth or declines in the postsecondary student population and the entrance of additional providers in the online postsecondary education market will further intensify competition, and any decline in the number of enrollments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, increased competition for college-ready students has led to an increase in the cost of advertising in certain marketing channels. Continued increases in the cost of advertising may adversely impact our ability to attract college-ready students and/or increase our student acquisition costs.\nWe expect to continue to face greater competition from non-traditional offerings, provided by both educational institutions and non-traditional providers.\nCompeting institutions and others provide non-traditional education programs without charge or at low costs, including CBE programs, coding bootcamps, micro-credentialing, massive open online courses, and other flexible and individualized programs. We believe that our institutions will continue to face new competition from non-traditional programs, including lower cost programs. We are working to develop our own alternatives in some of these areas, but these efforts may not be successful. For example, RU has offered CBE programs since 2017. CBE options are available in approximately 56 out of RU\u2019s 60 programs, based on the students election and eligibility. Other institutions have programs that are more fully developed, and our offerings may not be as successful or receive further market acceptance. Our institutions may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect their business or results of operations. Increased availability of federal student financial aid for CBE programs could create additional competition and drive additional students toward non-traditional education programs. These competitive factors could cause our institutions\u2019 enrollments, revenue, and profitability to decrease significantly.\nStrong competition in the military market could decrease our institutions\u2019 market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.\nWe anticipate that APUS will continue to see strong competition within the military market, which continues to be a primary market for APUS. There are a number of for-profit schools and not-for-profit institutions that focus on the military market because of the size of the market and the availability of funding, and some for-profit schools seek to attract students eligible for TA, VA education benefits, or both, at least in part as a strategy of those institutions to satisfy the current 90/10 Rule, which is described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The \u201890/10 Rule.\u2019\u201d Some of these institutions may develop relationships with the military and education service officers that are stronger than APUS\u2019s, which could have an adverse effect on APUS\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified students, and ultimately, on our financial condition. In addition, the Armed Forces have established, and may in the future establish, their own postsecondary education programs. For example, the Department of the Navy, in cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Coast Guard, in January 2022 expanded a pilot program for online courses at the United States Naval Community College, a community college supporting naval education for enlisted service members, with plans to enroll as many as 5,500 students into targeted associate\u2019s degree and certificate programs with partner colleges and universities. While a number of schools with which APUS competes participate in this program, APUS is not an eligible partner. The Armed Forces may also begin offering distance learning through their own institutions.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nIf we or our institutions fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for the operation of postsecondary education institutions, we and our institutions could face penalties and significant restrictions on operations, including loss of access to DoD tuition assistance programs and federal student loans and grants.\nWe and our institutions are regulated by (i) accrediting agencies, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government through ED. Our institutions are also subject to DoD and VA oversight because our institutions participate in TA and veterans\u2019 education benefits programs administered by the VA. Regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies address the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, and financial operations and condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to acquire new institutions, open new locations, add new or expand existing educational programs, change our\ncorporate structure or ownership, and make other substantive changes. Compliance with these requirements can also increase our cost of operations.\nFindings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards, and policies could result in any of the relevant regulatory agencies taking action including: imposing monetary fines, penalties, or injunctions; limiting operations, including restricting our institutions\u2019 ability to offer new programs of study or to open new locations, or imposing limits on our growth; limiting or terminating our ability to grant degrees; restricting or revoking our institutions\u2019 accreditation, licensure, or other approval to operate; limiting, suspending, or terminating our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, TA, or VA education benefit programs; requiring us to repay funds, post a letter of credit, or become subject to payment methods for Title IV programs that are not the advance payment system; subjecting us to civil or criminal penalties; or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf one of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV, TA, or VA education benefit programs, or if the amount of available funds under these programs were reduced, we could seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our institutions, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for funds under the Title IV, TA, or VA education benefit programs. We may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of our eligibility to participate in these programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.\nThe regulations, standards, and policies of ED, state regulatory bodies, and our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies change frequently and are subject to interpretive ambiguities. Recent and pending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under TA, ability to participate in Title IV programs, ability to participate in VA education benefit programs, or costs of doing business. We cannot predict with certainty how these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply, or will be deemed by others to have complied, with all of the requirements.\nIn addition, in some circumstances of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance, we may be subject to lawsuits under the federal False Claims Act, similar state false claim statutes, or various \u201cwhistleblower\u201d statutes. These lawsuits in some cases can be prosecuted by a private plaintiff in respect of some action taken by us, even if ED or another regulatory body does not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability, or the government can intervene and become a party to the lawsuit. These lawsuits have the potential to generate significant financial liability linked to our receipt of government funds, including Title IV funds and TA funds.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain their institutional accreditation, they would lose the ability to participate in Title IV and DoD tuition assistance programs.\nAccreditation at the institutional level by an accrediting agency recognized by ED is necessary to participate in TA and Title IV programs. Our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies may impose restrictions on their accreditation or may terminate their accreditation. To remain accredited, our institutions must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources, and financial stability. Our institutions also must comply with accrediting agency policies and requirements, such as the requirements to apply and wait for approval before making certain changes. For example, as it did with the RU Acquisition, HLC requires approval before the closing of a transaction in order for an institution to maintain accredited status after closing. Failure to meet accreditation criteria or standards or to comply with accreditation policies and requirements could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agency. The complete loss of institutional accreditation at one of our institutions would, among other things, render the institution and its students ineligible to participate in TA and Title IV programs, and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nThe postsecondary education regulatory environment has changed and may change in the future as a result of U.S. federal elections.\nChanges in the Presidential administrations and control of Congress as a result of the outcome of elections or other events could result in changes in or new legislation, appropriations, regulations, standards, policies and enforcement actions that could materially affect our business, including material consequences for our institutions\u2019 accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under student financial assistance programs, and costs of doing business.\nFor example, as a result of the 2020 U.S. federal elections, Democrats, who tend to support more regulation of and restrictions on for-profit institutions, gained control of the executive branch and both houses of Congress. The Biden administration and new Congress have acted and may continue to act to change or eliminate currently effective legislation and ED regulations, and to enact new legislation, such as legislation to reauthorize the HEA, and ED has initiated and could initiate new rulemaking processes to alter existing regulations and could act to change existing ED policies and practices with respect to matters related to postsecondary education institutions. For example, ARPA, which modifies the HEA\u2019s 90/10 Rule to require that a for-profit institution derive not less than 10 percent of its revenue from sources other than \u201cfederal education assistance funds\u201d, was enacted in 2021, and ED is engaged in negotiated rulemaking to address the 90/10 Rule and other topics. ED also recently completed rulemaking to address borrower defenses to repayment, public service student loan forgiveness programs, mandatory pre-dispute arbitration, and prohibition of class-action lawsuits, among other issues, but has yet to issue related proposed regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which the Biden administration and Congress, or any future administration or Congress, will act to change or eliminate or to implement new laws, regulations, standards, policies, and practices, nor can we predict the form that new laws, regulations, standards, policies, or practices may take or the extent to which those regulations, practices or policies may impact us or our institutions.\nA failure of HCN to satisfy ABHES accreditation standards, including specific student achievement indicators, could have a material adverse impact on HCN\u2019s student enrollment and our and HCN\u2019s revenue, cash flows, and results of operations.\nABHES annually reviews student achievement indicators, including retention rate, placement rate, and licensing and credentialing examination pass rate. Under ABHES policy, ABHES may withdraw accreditation at any time if it determines that an institution fails to demonstrate at least a 70% retention rate for each program, a 70% placement rate for each program, and a 70% first-time pass rate on mandatory licensing and credentialing examinations or fails to meet state-mandated results for credentialing or licensure. Alternatively, ABHES may in its discretion provide an opportunity for a program to come into compliance within a period of time specified by ABHES, and ABHES may extend the period for achieving compliance if a program demonstrates improvement over time or other good cause. For the reporting year ended June 30, 2021, several HCN programs at certain campuses did not satisfy ABHES\u2019s threshold requirements for retention rates. The retention rates were instead between 55% and 69% for the reporting year. ABHES has asked HCN to provide updated rates for the period July 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022 and an updated action plan to address any rate that remains below 70% in that period.\nIf any HCN campus or program fails to satisfy ABHES achievement measures, enrollment in such HCN campus or program could decline, or we could be forced to cease enrollments at that campus or in that program, which could have a material adverse impact on HCN\u2019s student enrollment and our and HCN\u2019s revenue, cash flows, and results of operations. The actions HCN takes to comply with ABHES requirements may not be successful in resolving existing issues and, if those actions are targeted at specific campuses or programs, may fail to prevent additional issues arising with respect to those or other campuses or programs. Similarly, even if HCN is successful in the long term in complying with these standards, the actions HCN takes to comply could result in increased costs or decreased enrollments, and impairment of goodwill.\nMore generally, any institutional or programmatic accreditor may have policies or standards related to specific student achievement indicators that, if not met, may result in our institutions experiencing adverse actions, up to and including withdrawal of accreditation for certain programs. Such outcomes could have an adverse impact on our ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue certain programs, any of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to maintain institutional accreditation could make them ineligible to participate in Title IV and TA programs and our student enrollments would decline.\nThe standards of accreditation agencies that accredit our institutions and programs can and do vary, and accreditation agencies may prescribe more rigorous standards than are currently in place. Complying with more rigorous accreditation standards could require significant changes to the way we operate our business and increase our administrative and other costs. No assurances can be given that our institutions or programs would be able to comply with more rigorous accreditation standards in a timely manner or at all. If one of our institutions or programs does not meet its accreditation requirements, its accreditation could be limited, modified, suspended, or terminated. Failure to maintain institutional accreditation would make our institutions ineligible to participate in Title IV and TA programs, which could have a material adverse effect on the institution\u2019s student enrollment and revenue. In addition, accrediting bodies may adopt new or revised criteria, standards, and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate, or limit the growth of our programs or for-profit institutions like ours.\nColleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Many institutions will only accept transfer credit from institutions with certain institutional accreditation. Students and sponsors of tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for quality assurance, and employers rely on institutions\u2019\naccredited status when evaluating a candidate\u2019s credentials. In addition, certain of our programs are accredited by programmatic accrediting agencies or recognized by professional organizations. If our institutions fail to satisfy the standards of these programmatic accrediting agencies and professional organizations, the relevant programs could lose the programmatic accreditation or professional recognition, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, in certain cases, professional licensure will not be granted if an applicant for licensure earned the relevant educational credential from an institution or educational program that lacks institutional or programmatic accreditation. Failure to obtain or maintain programmatic accreditation or professional recognition for certain programs could prevent our students from seeking and obtaining licensure or employment, result in materially reduced student enrollments in affected programs, and have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain state authorization in the states where they are physically located, the institutions would lose their ability to grant degrees and other credentials in that state and to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs.\nAs discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization,\u201d to participate in Title IV programs and TA, an institution must be legally authorized by the relevant education agency of the state in which it is physically located. Loss of state authorization by one of our institutions in the state in which it is physically located would cause that institution to be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and TA and to be unable to operate in the state and grant credentials. In addition, if one of our institutions were to lose its state authorization, it would lose its institutional accreditation. For example, with respect to RU and HCN, if either institution were to lose approval from any state board of nursing, students in the program lacking approval would not be eligible to apply for licensure by examination to practice nursing in that state.\nED regulations provide that an institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws, and the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements. If a state in which one of our institutions is located fails in the future to satisfy the provisions of that regulation, our institutions\u2019 ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs could be limited or terminated.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to comply with the requirements of the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, or regulations of ED or various states related to state authorization could result in actions that would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nVarious states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries, including registration requirements applicable to online education institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. As described more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization\u201d and \u201c-State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions,\u201d our institutions must comply with the requirements of SARA and California, which is the only state that does not participate in SARA, with regard to the interstate offering of postsecondary distance education and online education. Those requirements may change from time to time and, in some instances, are ambiguous or are left to the interpretative discretion of state regulators. Changes in requirements to participate in SARA or changes to state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer education programs and award degrees. If one of our institutions were to fail to comply with such requirements, the institution could lose its ability to participate in SARA or may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization to provide distance education. If one of our institutions were to fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, it could also be subject to injunctive actions or penalties. We cannot predict the extent to which states will retain membership in SARA, the manner in which SARA\u2019s rules may be modified, interpreted and enforced, our institutions\u2019 ability to comply with SARA\u2019s requirements and retain eligibility, or the impact that failure to meet the SARA requirements may have on our business.\nAs more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization\u201d, APUS and RU are subject to regulations that, among other thing, clarify the required methodology for determining the state in which a student is located for purposes of satisfying state authorization requirements for distance education courses and require an institution to disclose certain information related to whether programs leading to professional licensure meet applicable state requirements, regardless of program modality. Failure to make the disclosures required by these regulations could put us at risk of administrative enforcement action or related litigation, including claims from students related to misrepresentation and other matters. In addition, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, such disclosure requirements will have an effect on our enrollment processes and results.\nThe inability of our institutions\u2019 graduates to obtain professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields of study, particularly in nursing, could reduce our enrollments and revenue, limit our ability to offer educational programs, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nThe majority of RU\u2019s graduates, HCN graduates and certain APUS graduates seek professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation, particularly in nursing. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on numerous factors, including: individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and the accreditation of the institution and the specific program.\nFor example and as discussed more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions,\u201d failure to satisfy NCLEX pass rate requirements imposed by state boards of nursing can result in the state boards of nursing taking certain adverse actions, including placement of a program on provisional approval status or withdrawal of approval pursuant to an adjudication proceeding, and NCLEX exam pass rate requirements could limit our institutions\u2019 ability to expand into new states. HCN\u2019s ADN program has been on provisional approval status since March 2017 due to not meeting OBN\u2019s first-time pass rate standard for four consecutive years. HCN has been implementing changes, including curriculum, admissions, and academic achievement and course retake policy changes that are designed to improve NCLEX scores over time, but there is no assurance that these changes will be successful or will not have negative effects on HCN\u2019s enrollment. In addition, RU\u2019s ADN programs in Bloomington, Minnesota, in Illinois and in Kansas each experienced 2021 first-time NCLEX pass rates below the applicable state threshold. This was the third consecutive year of below threshold pass rates for the Bloomington program and the second consecutive year for the Illinois and Kansas programs. In February 2022, the Illinois ADN program was placed on probationary status by the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, or IDPR, as a result of which RU has two years to demonstrate evidence of implementing strategies to correct deficiencies and satisfy the required NCLEX pass rate. If after two years the pass rate does not satisfy the required standard, the program will be reevaluated by the IDPR for a determination as to whether the program will be allowed to continue on probation or whether it should be disapproved. If RU and HCN are unable to improve NCLEX first-time scores over time in relevant locations, this situation could have an adverse impact on our ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue the ADN Programs, either of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nState requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are professional certification standards, and we may not become aware of changes that may impact our students in certain instances. In the event that one or more states refuse to recognize our institutions\u2019 students for professional licensure based on factors relating to our institutions or programs, the potential growth of our institutions\u2019 programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, requirements for employment vary from employer to employer and from field to field. To the extent our graduates fail to satisfy requirements for employment by particular employers or in a particular profession based on characteristics of our programs, the ability to maintain enrollments, as well as the potential for growth of our institutions\u2019 programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, if our institutions\u2019 graduates fail to obtain professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields of study, we and our institutions could be exposed to litigation, including class-action litigation, claiming that we are at fault for such failure, which would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs, and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department of Education prior to seeking recertification, and our future success may be adversely affected if our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification.\nAs more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment-Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education,\u201d APUS, RU and HCN must periodically seek recertification from ED, ED may review our institutions\u2019 eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs, or the scope thereof.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification to participate in ED\u2019s Title IV programs, they will not be able to participate in TA because the DoD MOU requires an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV programs in order to participate in TA. Loss of participation in Title IV programs and TA would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, also as more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education,\u201d ED must in some cases provisionally certify an institution, which imposes additional conditions on the institution\u2019s receipt of Title IV funds. For example, APUS, RU and HCN are currently\nprovisionally certified with ED. As more fully described in the Risk Factor that begins \u201cRU is currently on provisional certification with the Department of Education...\u201d below, the TPPPA entered into by RU and ED in connection with the RU Acquisition continues growth restrictions that ED imposed as a result of RU\u2019s March 2019 change in ownership, including an enrollment cap on students who participate in Title IV.\nIn addition, as more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education,\u201d HCN was notified in December 2021 that it had been granted provisional certification until September 30, 2023 because it was subject to an open program review at the time of renewal.\nIf ED were to withdraw or not renew our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs, our students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds or TA funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nED\u2019s regulations specify extensive criteria that an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs and the sanctions ED may impose if an institution fails to satisfy any of those criteria. These criteria relate to, among other things, institutional staffing, operational standards such as procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV program funds, timely submission of accurate reports to ED, and various other procedural matters. If an institution fails to satisfy any of the administrative capability requirements, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to heightened cash monitoring status, or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d method of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.\nIf one of our institutions is found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s administrative capability requirements, it could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV program funding or certain Title IV-related conditions or fines could be imposed, which would adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility by one of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by ED, or post a letter of credit in favor of ED, and possibly accept other conditions, such as provisional certification, additional reporting requirements, or regulatory oversight of its participation in Title IV programs. ED may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to a parent company of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the parent company, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of ED, and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. For our institutions, ED applies its measures of financial responsibility at the level of the parent company, APEI. An obligation to post a letter of credit, or to accept other conditions, such as a change in our system of Title IV payment from ED for purposes of disbursement, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance, or affect our cash flow. As discussed in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - RU Acquisition Regulatory Review,\u201d as of September 30, 2020, RU\u2019s financial ratios failed to meet ED\u2019s standards of financial responsibility. On May 10, 2021, RU posted a letter of credit with ED totaling $23.1 million, which represents 10% of the Title IV program funds received by RU during its most recently completed fiscal year. Additionally, RU is required to make Title IV disbursements to eligible students and parents under HCM1 and provide monthly and bi-weekly financial and enrollment reporting to ED.\nThe 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations identify certain conditions or other triggering events that have or may have an adverse material effect on the institution\u2019s financial condition, in response to which ED would or could require that the institution submit some form of financial protection to ED. For more on the financial responsibility provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations, please refer to \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Borrower Defenses.\u201d If, under the 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations, ED determines that one of our institutions is not financially responsible because of one or more triggering events, the institution would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit equal to at least 10% of the amount of federal student financial aid funds received by the institution for the past year. If one of our institutions is found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s financial responsibility requirements, it could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, and results of operations. If we, as the parent company of an eligible institution, are found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s financial responsibility measures, all of our\ninstitutions could be limited in their access to, or lose, Title IV program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and financial position.\nED rules related to borrower defense-to-repayment claims and requirements related to dispute resolution may create significant liability that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan under the Direct Loan Program, or a Direct Loan. Under the Borrower Defense Regulations, as more fully described in \u201cRegulatory - Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Borrower Defenses,\u201d ED may initiate a proceeding to collect from an institution the amount of relief resulting from a borrower defense brought by an individual borrower. If ED determines that borrowers of Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loans, we could be subject to repayment liability to ED that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, which apply to all Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2017 and before July 1, 2020, prohibit requiring students to initially engage in an institutions\u2019 internal complaint processes, prohibit pre-dispute arbitration agreements, and class action lawsuit waivers, and require notification to ED of arbitration filings and awards, for claims that may form the basis for a borrower defense to repayment. The 2019 Borrower Defense Regulations, which apply to all Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2020, generally remove these prohibitions, but require institutions whose students must enter into pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers to disclose publicly those requirements, and prohibit requiring a student to participate in arbitration or any internal dispute resolution process prior to filing a borrower defense to repayment application with ED. As a result of these dispute resolution provisions, we could incur claims and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,\u201d ED recently completed negotiated rulemaking to address borrower defenses to repayment, among other issues, but has yet to issue related proposed regulations. We cannot predict whether ED\u2019s negotiated rulemaking process to address borrower defenses to repayment will result in regulatory changes that would harm our business.\nIf one or more of our institutions does not comply with the 90/10 Rule, it or they will lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs.\nThe HEA requires all for-profit education institutions to comply with what is commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, which imposes sanctions on institutions that derive more than 90% of their total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs, as calculated under ED\u2019s regulations. In recent years, Congress has considered various proposals that would modify the 90/10 Rule. In March 2021, ARPA, which modifies the 90/10 Rule to require that a for-profit institution derive not less than 10% of its revenue from sources other than \u201cfederal education assistance funds,\u201d was signed into law. ARPA specifies that the modifications shall apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. An ED final rule to implement the ARPA modifications is not expected to go into effect until July 1, 2023 at the earliest. We cannot predict to what extent ARPA and the final rule will affect us and our institutions. While ARPA does not define \u201cfederal education assistance funds,\u201d we expect such definition to be developed by rule and anticipate that ED would seek to include TA and VA education benefits in the scope of the definition. If the rulemaking process results in TA and VA being included in the \u201c90%\u201d side of the ratio, our institutions\u2019 90/10 Rule percentage will increase, particularly at APUS. Such a rule could also cause other educational institutions to decrease their focus on serving military-affiliated students using TA benefits, and while that could have a positive impact on our enrollments from those students, it could also have an adverse impact on our ability to meet the requirements of the 90/10 Rule. This change, and any resulting actions we take to adjust the operations of our institutions to comply with the rule, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and operations of our institutions.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood that Congress or ED will continue to modify the 90/10 Rule with respect to relevant sources of funds or other aspects of the calculation. For example, in recent years Congress has considered various other proposals that would modify the 90/10 Rule, including proposals to decrease the limit on Title IV funds from 90% to 85%. Such proposals, or other similar legislation, should they become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions. In addition, at least one state has passed, and other states may in the future pass, their own versions of the 90/10 Rule that include TA and VA education benefits or other sources of funds in the \u201c90%\u201d side of the ratio. To the extent that any additional laws or regulations, including regulations under ARPA, are adopted that limit or condition the participation of for-profit schools or distance education programs in TA or in Title IV programs, or that limit or condition the amount of TA for which for-profit schools or distance education programs are eligible to receive, our financial condition and results of operations\ncould be materially and adversely affected. However, at this time, we cannot predict the impact of the ARPA 90/10 Rule on our business, including because we cannot predict how ED will implement the ARPA 90/10 Rule provision.\nFor the past three years, RU has derived less than 80% and HCN has derived more than 80% of its total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs as calculated under ED\u2019s regulations. If RU and HCN is unable to attract students who do not depend on Title IV program aid, such as students who finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers, or through VA benefits, HCN\u2019s 90/10 Rule percentage may increase.\nIf any of our institutions fails to satisfy the 90/10 Rule and loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, it would also lose the ability to participate in the TA because DoD requires institutions to participate in the Title IV programs in order to participate in TA, and ineligibility of either or both of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs and TA would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCongressional and administrative examination of for-profit institutions has resulted in and could result in further legislative and regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict whether ED\u2019s concluded or forthcoming negotiated rulemaking processes will result in regulatory changes that would harm our business. Topics addressed or to be addressed include public service student loan forgiveness programs, mandatory pre-dispute arbitration, and prohibition of class-action lawsuits, ability to benefit provisions, certification procedures for participation in Title IV programs, change of ownership and change in control of institutions of higher education, financial responsibility for institutions of higher education, gainful employment, and standards of administrative capability, among others. These regulatory changes have the potential to materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn addition, in October 2021, in what it termed a broad-based initiative to deter for-profit college fraud, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, issued informational notices to 70 for-profit higher education institutions, including APUS and RU, informing them of certain marketing practices the FTC had previously determined to be deceptive or unfair and therefore unlawful under the FTC Act and thereby documenting that the institutions have knowledge that the FTC has found these marketing practices to be unfair or deceptive. The FTC also announced that it would be enhancing its enforcement cooperation with other agencies with oversight of educational institutions, including ED\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Finally, on October 6, 2021, ED announced that it had restored an Office of Enforcement within ED\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid to strengthen oversight of and enforcement actions against postsecondary institutions that participate in federal student loan, grant, and work-study programs. Any civil penalties or enforcement actions could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure by our institutions to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s incentive payment rule could result in sanctions and liability under the False Claims Act.\nIf one of our institutions pays a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of the HEA\u2019s prohibition on such payments, commonly referred to as the incentive payment rule, the institution could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If ED determines that one of our institutions violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to ED\u2019s satisfaction. ED may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. ED may also seek to recover Title IV funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. As described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,\u201d changes in the interpretation of this prohibition may create uncertainty about what constitutes impermissible incentive payments and errors in the implementation of our compensation programs and arrangements may also lead to impermissible payments. Ambiguities as to how the incentive payment rule is interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may negatively affect our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees.\nThe DoD MOU requires that institutions participating in TA have policies in place that are compliant with regulations issued by ED related to restrictions on incentive payments. In addition, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 bans incentive payments based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid with regard to VA benefits.\nIn addition, third parties may file \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suits on behalf of the federal government under the federal False Claims Act alleging violation of the incentive payment rule. Such suits may prompt ED investigations, and the federal government may determine to intervene in the lawsuits. Particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding interpretation of the incentive payment rule, the existence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, such suits or ED investigations\ncould have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline, could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, and could impact the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, among other things. As a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their student loan default rates are too high, and our future growth could be impaired as a result.\nAs described more fully under \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,\u201d to remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an educational institution\u2019s federal student loan cohort default rates must remain below certain specified levels. If an institution\u2019s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate. Educational institutions will lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their cohort default rate exceeds 40% for any given year or is equal to or greater than 30% for three consecutive years.\nGovernment policies to minimize the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may artificially lower our institutions\u2019 cohort default rates, which nevertheless may be higher than otherwise expected as a result of the pandemic. Congress and ED have implemented a temporary freeze on student loan payments and interest accruals until at least May 1, 2022, which means borrowers may be less likely to default on their loans and our institutions\u2019 cohort default rates may be lower not because borrowers are making timely repayments but because the government is allowing them not to make payments. At the same time, borrowers may face economic constraints as a result of the pandemic, which may lead to an increase in defaults and therefore an increase in our institutions\u2019 cohort default rates upon expiration of the forbearance period.\nIf one of our institutions is required to develop a formal default prevention plan, it may increase our administrative costs, which would adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, if Congress or ED restricts permitted types of default prevention assistance, the default rates of our former students may be negatively impacted. Congress could also increase the measuring period, which could negatively impact our default rates. In the past, members of Congress have also introduced proposed legislation that would assess institutions a share of the costs associated with default of student loans by students who were enrolled in the institutions\u2019 education programs and would tie an institution\u2019s obligation to make such \u201crisk-sharing\u201d payments to the institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs. If one of our institutions loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, students would no longer be eligible to use Title IV program funds at that institution, which would significantly reduce that institution\u2019s enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to administer elements of APUS\u2019 and HCN\u2019s participation in Title IV programs and their failure to perform services as agreed or to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nED\u2019s regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to ED for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. If any third-party servicer that we have engaged does not comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our institutions may be liable for its actions, and our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of one of our third-party servicers to perform the services as agreed may adversely impact our ability to operate, our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, and our financial condition. Further, in the event that our institutions transition to or from a third-party servicer for any of its services, there would be costs and risks related to the transition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur institutions will be subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if the Department of Education determines that our institutions failed to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAs more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,\u201d an institution participating in Title IV programs must calculate unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must timely return those funds. Under ED regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution\u2019s annual Title IV compliance audit constitute material noncompliance for which an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to comply with ED\u2019s substantial misrepresentation rules could result in material sanctions.\nED may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. If ED determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may: (i) if the institution is provisionally certified, as our institutions currently are, revoke an institution\u2019s program participation agreement or impose limitations on its participation in Title IV programs; (ii) deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution; or (iii) initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. If administrative actions or litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation were brought against our institutions, we could incur legal costs related to their investigation and defense, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the Clery Act as implemented by ED could result in sanctions.\nOur institutions must comply with certain campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to ED and disclose in an annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred within the institution\u2019s so-called \u201cClery geography.\u201d Our institutions each publish an annual security report as required by the Clery Act, and their failure to comply with the Clery Act requirements or regulations promulgated by ED could result in our institutions being fined or having their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, could lead to litigation, or could harm our institutions\u2019 reputation, each of which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.\nEnforcement of laws related to the accessibility of technology continues to evolve, which could result in increased information technology development costs and compliance risks.\nOur institutions make certain course content available to students through personal computers, mobile devices and other technological devices. The curriculum makes use of a combination of graphics, pictures, videos, animations, sounds, and interactive content. Federal agencies, including ED and the Department of Justice, have considered or are considering how electronic and information technology should be made accessible to persons with disabilities, including via specific technical standards. For example, as discussed further in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Accessibility for Students and Disabilities,\u201d ED\u2019s Office of Civil Rights has in recent years taken enforcement action against higher education institutions in connection with the inaccessibility of their websites and online learning management platforms to persons with a disability.\nAs a result of such enforcement action or as a result of new laws and regulations that require greater accessibility or accessibility in accordance with specific technical standards, our institutions may have to modify their online classrooms and other uses of technology to satisfy applicable requirements, which could require substantial financial investment. As with all nondiscrimination laws that apply to recipients of federal financial assistance, an institution may lose access to federal financial assistance if it does not comply with Section 504 requirements. In addition, private parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits alleging failure to comply with laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and defending against such actions may require our institutions to incur costs to modify their online classrooms and other uses of technology and costs of litigation.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims, or initiate enforcement actions or litigation against us, any of which could disrupt our institutions\u2019 operations and adversely affect their performance.\nOur institutions are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of noncompliance, enforcement proceedings, and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, students, employees, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. For example, ED regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in Title IV programs and the ED OIG regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. RU and HCN are currently subject to ongoing Title IV program reviews. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has investigated and, in some cases, brought lawsuits against for-profit institutions alleging that the institutions engaged in deceptive trade practices, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sued for-profit institutions for engaging in allegedly illegal predatory lending practices.\nIf the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, our institutions may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions, or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. Even if our institutions adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those\nreviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us or one of our institutions may result in reputational damage, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit. Any one of these sanctions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our institutions, which may materially adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIn January 2022, HCN received from ED the program review report from a review that had been pending since June 2017, when ED requested information and conducted an on-site visit for two HCN locations. ED subsequently requested additional information. The review included findings of a failure to prorate fees, return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly computed, untimely and inaccurate reporting to the National Student Loan Data System, incomplete verification, and cost of attendance formulation deficiencies. HCN is required to do a full file review in connection with the return of Title IV funds finding, must have the review tested by an independent auditor, and must prepare policies and procedures and take other actions in connection with the findings, with a response due by April 8, 2022. ED will review the response and then issue a final program review determination letter specifying any liabilities. At this time, we cannot predict whether ED will impose any liability or limitations on HCN as a result of the review.\nInvestigations by state Attorneys General, Congress, and governmental agencies may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs.\nWe and other for-profit postsecondary education providers have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation in recent years. State attorneys general have increasingly focused on allegations of improper recruiting, compensation, and deceptive marketing practices, among other issues. States may also have consumer disclosure laws, including laws specifically applicable to for-profit institutions, and a state attorney general may take the position that any such laws apply to institutions that offer wholly online education to students in the state. In recent years, a number of state attorneys general launched investigations into for-profit postsecondary education institutions. For example, in August 2018, we resolved an investigation by the Attorney General of Massachusetts of alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by AMU pursuant to which, and without any finding or admission of wrongdoing on APUS\u2019s part, APUS paid $270,000 and agreed to otherwise comply with applicable Massachusetts regulations. Other state attorneys general may also initiate inquiries into us or our institutions. Actions by state attorneys general and other governmental agencies, such as the recently restored Office of Enforcement within ED\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions\u2019 programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit institutions.\nRegulatory investigations and civil litigation brought against other for-profit education institutions have attracted adverse media and social media coverage, have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings, and have in some cases resulted in legislation or rulemaking. In some cases, institutions have ceased operations, including while under multiple government investigations. Broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector have negatively affected public perceptions of for-profit education institutions, including our institutions, and this trend could continue or broaden. In addition, reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, Congress, and governmental agencies have led to adverse media and social media coverage of postsecondary and for-profit education. Adverse media or social media coverage regarding others in our industry, or regarding us or our institutions directly, could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments at our institutions, lower revenue and increased expenses, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. Such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by ED, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures, state attorneys general, or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including us and our institutions. For these reasons or others, not-for-profit or public education institutions may act to differentiate themselves from the for-profit education institutions, including by choosing not to enter into collaborations with for-profit institutions, including us, or by excluding for-profit institutions from membership in industry groups. Similarly, some corporations may choose not to collaborate with for-profit providers such as us for programs for their employees or for other training purposes. For example, when Walmart announced that it will not be renewing its partnership agreement with APUS, it announced a new program that only involved not-for-profit institutions.\nIf we undergo a change in ownership or control, the Department of Education will place our institutions on provisional certification to the extent they are not already on provisional status, and the terms of that provisional certification could limit our institutions\u2019 potential for growth and adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, our revenue, and results of operations.\nAs described more fully under \u201cRegulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations,\u201d an institution whose parent undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in\nTitle IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility. Future transactions could constitute a change in ownership or control under ED\u2019s regulations and could cause ED to leave provisional certification in place for our institutions as required by the HEA. The conditions of provisional certification or heightened scrutiny by ED could impact, among other things, our institutions\u2019 ability to add educational programs, or additional locations, our ability to acquire other institutions, or our ability to make other significant changes. For example, as described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Eligibility and Certification Procedures,\u201d ED imposed growth restrictions on RU in connection with RU\u2019s 2019 change in ownership and continued those restrictions after the RU Acquisition as part of RU\u2019s temporary provisional certification. In addition, if ED were to determine that our institutions were unable to meet their responsibilities while they were provisionally certified, as our institutions currently are, ED could seek to revoke our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections than if they were fully certified. Limitations on our institutions\u2019 operations could, and the loss of our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs would, adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollments, and our revenue and results of operations. See also the Risk Factor that begins \u201cRU is currently on provisional certification with the Department of Education...\u201d below.\nIf regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our Company or of institutions that we own or acquire, our and our institutions\u2019 ability to operate could be impaired.\nIf we or one of our institutions experiences a change of ownership or control under the standards of applicable state regulatory bodies, accrediting agencies, ED, or other regulators, we or the institution governed by such agencies must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution\u2019s common stock, significant changes in the composition of an institution\u2019s Board of Directors, internal restructurings, acquisitions of institutions including the RU Acquisition, or certain other transactions. Some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our or our institutions\u2019 failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the relevant regulatory agencies following a transaction involving a change of ownership or control could result in a suspension of operating authority, loss of accreditation, or suspension, loss of ability to participate in Title IV programs or certain growth restrictions including with respect to adding locations and programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions and our financial condition. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require our institutions to suspend activities in that state or otherwise impair our institutions\u2019 operations. The potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence, among other things, future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Growth restrictions that ED could impose as a result of change in ownership are more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations\u201d and \u201c-Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.\u201d\nRU is currently on provisional certification with the Department of Education, including because of the recent RU Acquisition, and the terms of that provisional certification could limit its potential for growth.\nIn July 2021, ED notified RU that in connection with its March 2019 change in ownership, ED was imposing certain temporary growth restrictions on the institution, including limitations on new programs and locations a cap on enrollments by students that participate in Title IV programs. Additionally, ED required RU to submit periodic financial and enrollment reports, a requirement that it had imposed on RU in connection with a financial responsibility letter of credit previously imposed on RU. Please refer to the Risk Factor with the caption that begins \u201cA failure to demonstrate \u2018financial responsibility\u2019 may result in the loss of eligibility...\u201d. On September 9, 2021, RU timely submitted a change in ownership and control application to ED seeking approval to participate in the Title IV programs under our ownership. ED and RU entered into a Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement, or TPPPA, effective as of October 14, 2021, that allows RU to continue disbursing Title IV funds during the period of ED\u2019s review of the change in ownership application. The TPPPA continues the growth restrictions that ED imposed as a result of the March 2019 change in ownership, including the same enrollment cap, with certain qualifications more fully described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations.\u201d These growth restrictions could limit or adversely affect RU\u2019s growth opportunities, including restricting its ability to serve additional students, particularly additional nursing students, and limiting its ability to continue to evolve to address current education or market needs by providing new or changed programs. The growth restrictions could also have an adverse effect on our ability to grow revenue or meet investors\u2019 and financial analysts\u2019 expectations for financial performance.\nCertain contingents of Congress continue to examine the for-profit postsecondary education sector, which could result in targeted legislation, heightened oversight, or additional Department of Education rulemaking that may limit or condition Title IV program participation of for-profit schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nCertain contingents of Congress continue to examine institutions like ours. This examination has resulted in the introduction of various pieces of legislation, the holding of several hearings by various Congressional committees, and Congressional investigations and inquiries. We have previously incurred significant legal and other costs to respond to Congressional inquiries and could incur significant legal and other costs to respond to any future inquiries. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, Congress may refocus on for-profit education institutions, but Democrats, who gained control of both houses of Congress as a result of the 2020 U.S. federal elections, tend to support more regulation of and restrictions on for-profit institutions. We also cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, any hearings or investigations will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV programs, or litigation alleging statutory violations, regulatory infractions, or common law causes of action.\nCongress has in the past changed, and may in the future change, eligibility standards and funding levels for federal student financial aid programs, DoD tuition assistance, and other programs. Other governmental or regulatory bodies may also change similar laws or regulations relating to such programs, which could adversely affect our student population, revenue, and financial condition.\nTitle IV programs are made available pursuant to the provisions of the HEA, and the HEA comes up for reauthorization by Congress approximately every five to six years. In the recent past, Congress has passed short-term non-substantive extensions of the HEA pending comprehensive reauthorization legislation. Further, when Congress does not act on comprehensive reauthorization through a single piece of legislation, it may act through multiple pieces of legislation. Congress completed the most recent reauthorization through multiple pieces of legislation and may reauthorize the HEA in a piecemeal manner in the future. The previous Congress considered comprehensive legislation to reauthorize the HEA, and Congress is expected to consider such legislation again in the future. We cannot predict whether, in what form, or when, the two houses of Congress will reauthorize the HEA or whether, or when, the President will sign reauthorization legislation. Amendments to the HEA could occur as part of reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. Additionally, Congress determines the funding level for each Title IV program on an annual basis.\nFuture Congressional action, including in reauthorizations or appropriations acts, may result in legislative changes that could adversely affect the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, TA, and the availability of such funding sources for our students. Members of Congress frequently propose legislation to alter or amend the terms under which our institutions participate in the federal student financial aid programs. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV programs or the ability of our institutions or students to participate in these programs could materially harm our institutions\u2019 business. A reduction in government funding levels could lead to lower enrollments at our institutions and require our institutions to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for their students. Lower student enrollments at our institutions or their students\u2019 inability to arrange alternative sources of funding could adversely affect our financial condition. Congressional action may also require our institutions to modify their practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory expenses.\nWe are not in a position to predict whether any particular legislation that could adversely affect the for-profit education sector will be passed by Congress or signed into law in the future, but Democrats, who tend to support more regulation of and restrictions on for-profit institutions, gained control of the executive branch and both houses of Congress as a result of the 2020 U.S. federal elections. The reallocation of funding among Title IV programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different Title IV programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institutions and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and may enter into or seek to enter into, business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, or divert management attention.\nIn addition to the RU Acquisition and our acquisition of GSUSA, we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties consolidating operations and integrating financial, information technology and other systems, as well as the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations during the acquisition and integration processes;\n\u2022inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval of the acquisition from the necessary regulatory agencies, or the imposition of operating restrictions or a letter of credit requirement on us or on the acquired institution such as in the case of the RU Acquisition;\n\u2022challenges relating to conforming non-compliant financial reporting procedures to those required of a subsidiary of a U.S. reporting company, including procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022expenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal and regulatory contingencies.\nAny inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, many acquisitions result in the acquirer recording goodwill. If any acquisitions for which we record goodwill are not successful or experience challenges, that goodwill may become impaired and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, we recorded pretax, non-cash charges of $7.3 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill as a result of determinations that the fair value of HCN was less than its carrying value because of circumstances including HCN\u2019s underperformance against 2019 internal targets and overall 2019 financial performance.\nThe RU Acquisition was, and our acquisition of any other educational institution would also likely be, considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards. For such an acquisition, we may need approval from ED, applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies, and possibly other regulatory bodies, a number of which can only be requested after completion of the acquisition. Our inability to obtain such approvals with respect to a completed acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a productive result. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of securities or could require use of substantial portions of our available cash, as in the HCN acquisition and the RU Acquisition, or issuances of debt, as in connection with the RU Acquisition, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nIntegrating our business with RU\u2019s business may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and we may not realize the expected benefits of the Rasmussen Acquisition, which may adversely affect our business results.\nIf we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate or are not able to successfully integrate RU into our existing operations, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the RU Acquisition, including cost savings and other synergies and growth opportunities. Even if the integration of RU\u2019s business is successful, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the RU Acquisition during the anticipated time frame, or at all. For example, events outside our control, such as changes in regulation and laws, as well as economic trends, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from this acquisition. In addition, RU was previously a privately held company and was not required to maintain an internal control infrastructure that would meet the standards of a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs that we may incur to implement such controls and procedures may be substantial and we could encounter unexpected delays and challenges in this implementation. In addition, we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of RU\u2019s financial and disclosure controls and procedures.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the RU Acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon our revenue, level of expenses, and operating results, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock after the completion of the RU Acquisition. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in the implementation of shared services, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with students, faculty and other employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the RU Acquisition. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness under our credit agreement the cost of servicing that debt could adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may not be able in the future to service that debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations under the credit agreement will depend on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. The indebtedness we incurred in connection with the RU Acquisition requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity or sell certain of our assets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change of control, we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of\nour indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nOur business could be harmed if our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid.\nWe collected a substantial portion of our fiscal year 2021 consolidated revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds. Any processing disruptions by ED, by our institutions, or by third-party service providers may impact the ability of our institutions\u2019 students to obtain Title IV financial aid on a timely basis. If our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid, either because of administrative challenges on their part or the part of their vendors, or the inability of ED to process Title IV funds on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 business and on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid because of administrative challenges on their part or the part of their vendors, ED could require that our institutions become subject to payment methods for Title IV programs that are not the advance payment system, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 cash flows.\nEfforts to diversify our business outside of the traditional areas served by our institutions may provide strategic and operational challenges that we are not prepared or able to address.\nWe intend to continue to explore opportunities to invest in the education industry, which could include purchasing or investing in other education-related companies or companies developing new technologies. As we seek opportunities to expand our business and serve markets beyond those traditionally served by our institutions, we may encounter strategic and operational challenges different from those within our existing institutions. We or our institutions may have limited experience operating in new businesses and markets or new modes of teaching and may need to modify systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other institutions and organizations. For example, GSUSA is one of the largest providers of training to the federal government workforce, a market in which we have limited experience, and its contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, a regulatory framework with which we have limited experience. The Federal Acquisition Regulation creates compliance risk, affects how GSUSA interacts and does business with its federal government clients, including by providing government agencies with rights not typically found in commercial contracts, and may impose added costs on GSUSA\u2019s business. In addition, our systems and infrastructure may not be able to respond quickly enough to support new business opportunities, or we may not otherwise be able to address the strategic or operational differences of or compliance challenges associated with these new opportunities. If we are unable to successfully capitalize on new opportunities, the value of our common stock may decline over time, including because of the challenges of growing our core business under our current model.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds will be available on acceptable terms.\nWe may need additional capital in the future for various reasons, including to finance business acquisitions, as we did with the RU Acquisition, or investments in technology or to achieve growth or fund other business initiatives, but there is no assurance that capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Additionally, any securities issued to raise capital may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate capital is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, our and our institutions\u2019 ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures, will be limited.\nOur access to capital markets and sourcing for additional funding to expand or operate our business is subject to market conditions. Credit concerns regarding the for-profit postsecondary education industry as a whole also may impede our access to capital markets. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may have to limit strategic initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEconomic and market conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of COVID-19, and changes in interest rates, could affect our enrollments, success with placement and persistence and cohort default rates.\nOur business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by a general economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or abroad, including the impact of COVID-19. Our institutions derive a significant portion of their revenue from Title IV programs, which include student loans with interest rates subsidized by the federal government. Additionally, some students finance their education through private loans that are not government subsidized. Historically low interest rates have created a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, our students may have to pay higher interest rates on their Title IV program loans and private loans as a result of recent and expected future interest rate increases. Increases in applicable interest\nrates could result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to our existing and prospective students, which could result in a reduction in our enrollment. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to our students\u2019 repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our eligibility to participate in some Title IV programs, which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nAdverse economic developments, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, that affect the United States could also result in a reduction in the number of jobs available to our graduates and lower salaries being offered in connection with available employment, which, in turn, could result in declines in our success with placements and persistence. In addition, adverse economic developments could adversely affect the ability or willingness of our former students to repay student loans, which could increase our institutions\u2019 student loan cohort default rates and require increased time, attention, and resources to manage these defaults. Our institutions\u2019 students are able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition and fees. The excess is received by such students as a credit balance refund. However, if a student withdraws, our institutions must return any unearned Title IV funds (which may include a portion of the credit balance refund) and must seek to collect from the student any resulting amounts owed to the institution. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students\u2019 abilities to satisfy debts to the institution, including debts that result from returns of unearned Title IV amounts. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without repayment from our institutions\u2019 students could increase, and our financial results could suffer.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage and limit our exposure to bad debt.\nWe experienced increases in bad debt in our HCN segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. We have also had periods at APUS where we have experienced increases in our bad debt expense, and there is no assurance that bad debt expense will not increase at APUS again in the future or at RU. There is no assurance that we will be able to limit our exposure to bad debt or that steps we take to limit bad debt will be effective. Bad debt increases at our institutions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party vendors whose service may be of lower quality than ours, whose responsiveness may be less timely than ours, and whose compliance practices may increase our operational and compliance risk.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide certain services to our institutions and their students primarily related to information technology services, our learning management system, and financial aid processing, and expect to rely more heavily on such vendors, particularly through cloud computing services, in the future. While we monitor and assess vendor service, it is possible that the quality of service and the timeliness of vendor responses may be less than the service and responsiveness that we or our institutions would provide. Third-party vendors may lack adequate business continuity planning. Using third-party vendors increases compliance risk that the vendors may not adequately protect personal information, or that they may not comply with applicable federal or state regulations. Further, transitioning from existing vendors or from in-house processes to new providers or from third-party providers to in-house processes or vice versa, such as the replacement of our learning management system with a commercial cloud-based system in 2020, involves inherent risks, including the risk of significant disruptions of integral processes. In the event third-party vendors fail to provide services, lack adequate continuity planning, or fail to provide necessary implementation or transition services, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our institutions may lose the ability to participate in Title IV programs or Department of Defense tuition assistance programs, or have participation in these programs conditioned or limited.\nOur institutions must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid. We cannot be certain that our institutions\u2019 systems and processes will continue to be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with the changing nature of these fraud schemes. Our institutions, in particular APUS, have been the target of fraudulent and abusive activity, including related to Title IV program funds. We believe the risk of outside parties attempting to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds at APUS, including as a result of identity theft, is heightened due to its being an exclusively online education provider and its relatively low tuition.\nED requires institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the ED OIG credible information about fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs, and in the past our institutions have referred to the OIG information with respect to potential fraud by applicants and students. If the systems and processes that our institutions have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, ED may find that our institutions do not satisfy ED\u2019s administrative capability requirements, which could have the adverse effects described in the Risk Factor captioned \u201cA failure to demonstrate \u201cadministrative\ncapability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\u201d In addition, our institutions\u2019 ability to participate in Title IV programs and TA is conditioned on maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by ED. Any significant failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause our institutions to fail to meet their accreditors\u2019 standards. Furthermore, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering online programs, like APUS\u2019s programs, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for such a program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to meet the requirements of our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies could result in the loss of accreditation of one or more of our institutions, which could result in their loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, TA, or both.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and develop skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed, and changes in management could cause disruption and uncertainty.\nWe must attract, retain, and develop diverse and highly qualified management, faculty, administrators, and other skilled personnel to our institutions. As we continue to grow our business, make acquisitions, and expand our geographic scope, we need to ensure effective succession for key executive and employee roles in order to meet the growth, development, and profitability goals of our business. Hiring competition is intense, especially for faculty in specialized areas and qualified executives. While we continue to work to strengthen our management team and to attract and retain high-caliber talent, including through various human resources programs and what we believe are competitive market compensation and benefit practices, our efforts may not be successful. For example, due to COVID-19 there has been an increase in demand for nursing professionals, which we believe has impacted our ability to recruit and retain qualified nursing faculty at RU and HCN. We also believe that current job market dynamics, where the monthly percentage of non-farm workers in the United States who quit their jobs broke multiple all-time U.S. records in 2021 in what is being referred to as the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d, and current low unemployment, has further increased the challenge of employee retention more broadly. Overall, turnover of our employees during 2021 was approximately 6% to 10% higher than turnover in 2020, depending on segment.\nIf we fail to attract new management, faculty, administrators, or skilled personnel or fail to retain, develop, and motivate our existing management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel, our institutions and our ability to serve our students and expand our programs, open new locations, make investments or acquisitions, and update or enhance our technology could be severely harmed, and changes in management could disrupt our business and cause uncertainty.\nOur success depends on the contributions of our approximately 5,800 employees.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents, experience, and efforts of our employees, and we believe that fostering a culture and practice of innovation, quality, communication, cooperation, honesty, and respect is important to attracting and retaining high caliber talent. In addition, our strategic initiatives require our management, faculty, staff, and skilled personnel to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. Our failure to develop and maintain a positive culture and strong employee morale or to continue fostering the growth and development of our personnel, including through the use of staff performance evaluation systems and processes, particularly if the use of those systems and processes is unreliable or inconsistent, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on key personnel to lead with integrity. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values, we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our culture. Hiring and retention may also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that enables our employees to thrive.\nWe also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. We have had a number of other executive officers retire or otherwise depart our Company over the last several years and we continually evaluate our leadership structure. While we have employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Technology Officer, we do not have employment agreements with other executives or personnel, and the employment agreements that we do have do not prevent our executives from voluntarily ceasing to work for us. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. While we have processes in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel, or transfer knowledge, could significantly impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience in making investments in other entities, and any such investments may not result in strategic benefits for our business or could expose us to other risks.\nFrom time to time we will consider and may pursue strategic investments. These transactions could include, among other things, investments in, partnerships or joint ventures with other schools, service providers or education technology related companies, among other types of entities. These types of investments involve significant challenges and risks, including that the investment does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we acquire unknown liabilities, or that management\u2019s attention is diverted from our core business. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition. Any investments in other entities may also subject us to the operating and financial risks of such entities, and we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of such entities.\nWe have made minority investments in entities in which we do not have sole control, which present risks in addition to those that apply to other investments or acquisitions. We do not have the ability to control the policies, management or affairs of these entities, and generally we would not have that ability in any minority investment in an entity. The interests of persons who control the entities in which we have invested and may invest may differ from our interests, and they may cause such entities to take actions that are not in our best interest, and we may become involved in disputes with such persons. Our inability to control entities in which we make minority investments could negatively affect our ability to realize the strategic benefits of those investments.\nWe cannot ensure that we will realize any strategic benefits from these investments in the near-term or at all. To the extent that the strategic benefits of any investment are not timely realized, or the investment otherwise underperforms, we may wish to dispose of the investment. Because our interests in entities are highly illiquid and not traded in any public market, we may not be able to timely dispose of these interests or may have to sell at less than our carrying value, as we did in 2021 with our interest in Second Avenue Software. Further, should the value of these investments become impaired, we may be required to, and in the past have been required to, reduce the carrying value of these investments.\nOur inability to dispose of our interest in such an entity, or a reduction in the carrying value of such an entity on our books, would negatively affect our operating results.\nOur limited ability to obtain exclusive proprietary rights and protect our intellectual property, as well as disputes we may encounter from time to time with third parties regarding our use of their intellectual property, could harm our operations and prospects.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our institutions develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and other registrations. Our institutions rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content experts.\nWe cannot ensure that any measures we and our institutions take to protect our intellectual property or obtain rights to the intellectual property of others will be adequate, or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our institutions\u2019 proprietary rights in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate the proprietary rights of our institutions. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or copy aspects of our institutions\u2019 curriculum, online resource material, quality management, and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our institutions\u2019 business. Protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our institutions\u2019 competitors of competing courses and programs.\nOur institutions may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property and may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against our institutions alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for our institutions to conduct operations in such a way as to avoid disputes regarding those intellectual property rights. Any such dispute could subject our institutions to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether that dispute has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and our institutions may be required to alter the content of their courses or pay monetary damages, which may be significant.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of course materials posted online for course discussions.\nIn some instances, our institutions\u2019 faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content online in course discussion boards or in other venues. The laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional\npolicies governing these practices. We and our institutions may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online. Third parties may raise claims against us and our institutions for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us and our institutions to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our institutions\u2019 faculty members or students could also post classified material on course discussion boards, which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our institutions\u2019 reputations and relationships with members of the military and government. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages and our institutions may be required to alter the content of their courses.\nWe rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and certain investments.\nWe rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and certain investments and generate all of our operating income through our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and investments. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to us depends on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory requirements such as obligations to maintain certain restricted cash or post letters of credit, financial performance, accreditation requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries, and the covenants of any future obligations that we or our subsidiaries may incur. For example, due to financial performance, HCN did not pay a dividend to APEI in 2019 or 2020.\nLegal proceedings, particularly class action lawsuits, may require human and financial resources, distract our management, and negatively affect our reputation and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we and our institutions have been and may be involved in various legal proceedings. In recent years, we have observed an increase in litigation brought against for-profit schools, including class actions brought by students and prospective students based on alleged misrepresentations about a school\u2019s programs, an increase in \u201cqui tam\u201d lawsuits, and investigations by state attorneys general into for-profit postsecondary education institutions, which are described above under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry.\u201d The significant human and financial resources required to investigate and respond to claims brought in any future litigation may distract management\u2019s attention from operating our business or lead to larger payments or liabilities, including adverse regulatory action, and, as a result, negatively affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Technology Infrastructure\nWe need to continue to expend time, money and resources into our institutions\u2019 information technology, which may place a strain on our capacity that could adversely affect our systems, controls, and operating efficiency, and those of our institutions.\nWe need to invest capital, time, and resources to update our institutions\u2019 information technology, including our student-facing systems, in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace, including data analytics, artificial intelligence, interactive and immersive user and learning experience technologies such as those that leverage virtual and augmented reality, multi-channel customer engagement, and robotic process automation, to update or replace older systems, and to enhance functionality. We incurred approximately $5.6 million and $6.0 million during 2020 and 2021, respectively, as part of an overall information technology transformation program. We expect to make similar expenditures in future years. We will also have to make investments to integrate the technology systems of RU and GSUSA and likely any other business we may acquire in the future. Our efforts to improve our information technology systems may not be successful, may cost more than expected, may increase our level of spending, not all of which can be capitalized, or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, particularly. We may also be unable to address all of the initiatives that we would like to pursue or find that the number of projects we are working on impacts our ability to adequately address critical areas. As a result of unsuccessful development efforts, or as a result of replacing outdated technology, software or other technology related assets, we have in the past had and may in the future have assets that become impaired. We will continue to evaluate our Partnership At a DistanceTM, or PAD, at APUS, customized student information and services system for possible changes and upgrades and anticipate that we will eventually make significant changes to that system, as well.\nIf we are unable to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 technology resources or update their resources appropriately, their ability to handle future growth, to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, even if we are able to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 resources and\nupdate their resources appropriately, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by an increased level of spending.\nSignificant system disruptions to our online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructure and systems of third parties, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and could damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe performance and reliability of our and our institutions\u2019 networks and technology infrastructure, including those of third parties systems we use or rely on, is critical to our institutions\u2019 reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could interrupt our or our institutions\u2019 ability to operate and could result in the unavailability of our online classrooms, preventing students from accessing their courses and adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, our institutions\u2019 technology infrastructure, and the technology infrastructure of our third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist activities, and telecommunications failures.\nThe proprietary information systems and processes at APUS that we refer to as Partnership at a DistanceTM, or PAD, have been predominantly developed in-house, with limited support from outside vendors. To the extent that we have utilized third-party vendors to provide certain software products for our systems, we have generally needed to integrate those products into, and ensure that they function with, PAD. We continuously work on upgrades to PAD, and our employees devote substantial time to its development and to the successful integration of third-party products into PAD. To the extent that we face system disruptions, malfunctions or vulnerabilities with PAD or the failure of PAD to meet internal or industry standards, or lose employees with experience on our systems, we may not have the capacity to address such disruptions, malfunctions, vulnerabilities, or failures or to continue to administer or make adequate modifications to PAD with our internal resources, and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system.\nRU relies on Collegis for a variety of outsourced information technology functions, including data center, learning management system, user support, and network and voice services, in addition to the marketing services that Collegis provides. The contract with Collegis for managed IT services expires in September 2024, may be renewed only by mutual consent, and we are only able to terminate it in advance of expiration under limited circumstances. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew our contract with Collegis or other vendors with whom we have contracts that expire or that such renewals will be on the same or substantially similar terms or on conditions that are commercially reasonable to us.\nWe also use third-party services such as cloud computing and software-as-a-service for certain aspects of our operations and are reliant on the capabilities of vendors for such functions. We migrated to a cloud-based learning management system for APUS and expect to increasingly rely on cloud computing and software-as-a-service providers for our information technology operations in the future, such as through the continued implementation of a cloud-based customer relationship management system. Our learning management system upgrade was completed in early 2021 and the first phases of our customer relationship management system upgrade were completed in January 2022.\nVendors, such as Collegis, and our cloud computing service providers may take actions beyond our control that could adversely affect our access to the providers\u2019 services, including discontinuing or limiting our access to their platforms or modifying or interpreting their terms of service or other policies in a manner that impacts our ability to run our business and operations. In addition, any transition of third-party services, whether to another vendor or directly to us or our institutions, could be difficult to implement and cause us to incur significant time and expense. Any significant downtime or other interruption or disruption of these services could adversely impact our operations and our business.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of our institutions\u2019 data centers or server rooms or those of our vendors could cause a loss of data. Even with redundancy, a significant interruption in the operation of these facilities or the loss of institutional and operational data due to a natural disaster, fire, power interruption, act of terrorism, or another unanticipated catastrophic event, including as a result of climate change, may not be preventable. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by the failure to successfully expand or upgrade systems, or to manage transitions and implementations, could reduce the ability to manage network and technological infrastructure, which could adversely affect our institutions\u2019 operations and reputations. Additionally, our institutions do not necessarily control the operation of the facilities hosting our technology infrastructure and may be required to rely on other parties to provide physical security, facilities management, and communications infrastructure services. If any third-party vendors encounter financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that causes them to fail to adequately secure and maintain their facilities or provide necessary connectivity or capacity, our institutions and their students may experience interruptions in service or the loss or theft of important data, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nData security breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise sensitive information, including personal information, and cause system disruptions and significant damage to our business and reputation.\nWe process and maintain on our network systems certain information that is confidential, proprietary, personal (such as social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and student academic records, and including information about students, their families, employees, and contractors), or otherwise sensitive, including financial and confidential business information. Our computer networks, and the networks of our third-party vendors, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access by computer hackers, phishing, ransomware, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering and other security attacks or security problems, including vulnerabilities in software and software code. An individual or group that circumvents security measures could misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. In addition, errors in the storage, use, or transmission of personal information, errors with our systems or networks, or intentional or unintentional misuse or loss of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Our systems and the systems maintained by our third-party providers have been subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access, breaches and other system disruptions and these and similar incidents could happen again. It may be difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents, the scope of such incidents and the damage caused thereby, and we may not yet be aware of, or know the scope of and damage caused by, prior incidents. If we or third parties with access to our systems, or to confidential, proprietary, or personal information experience security breaches in the future or we learn of a past breach that we or third parties have experienced, we may be required to expend significant resources to investigate, remediate, or disclose these security breaches or to address resulting regulatory investigations or litigation. Such breaches could result in the impositions of penalties, disruption to our operations, and damage to our reputation. Our increased use and reliance on cloud computing could expose us to additional risks. While our contractual arrangements with third-party providers such as cloud computing vendors provide for the protection of information, we cannot control these vendors or their systems and cannot guarantee that a data security or privacy breach of their systems will not occur in the future.\nWe use external vendors to perform security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess our information security. We utilize this information to audit ourselves to monitor the security of our technology infrastructure and to assess whether and how to prioritize the allocation of scarce resources to protect data and systems. However, we cannot ensure that these security assessments and audits will identify or appropriately categorize relevant risks or result in the protection of our computer networks against security breaches. Similarly, although we require our third-party vendors contractually to maintain a level of security that is acceptable to us and work closely with vendors to address potential and actual security concerns and attacks, we cannot ensure that they will protect confidential, proprietary, or personal information on their systems. Breaches at third-party vendors may also affect our systems. System disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructures and systems of third parties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe face an ever-increasing number of threats to our computer networks and systems, including unauthorized activity and access, malicious penetration, system viruses, ransomware, phishing, other malicious code and vulnerabilities in software and software code and cyber-attacks, including individual or organized cyber-attacks. Any of these threats could breach our security and disrupt our systems. These risks increase when we make changes to our information technology systems or implement new ones. Our size makes us a prominent target for hacking and other cyber-attacks within the education industry. From time to time we experience security events and incidents, and these reflect an increasing level of sophistication, organization, and innovation. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats and may subsequently be deemed to have been inadequate by regulators or courts. The lack of prescriptive measures in data security and cybersecurity laws could contribute to any such regulator or court findings. An organization or individual who circumvents computer system security measures could misappropriate confidential, proprietary or personal information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations, perhaps over an extended period of time prior to detection. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of or alleviate problems caused by these system disruptions and security breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nVarious federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, and security of student and consumer data. These laws could be applied in a manner that results in costs, the imposition of fines and operational conditions on our business. For example, if an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Failure to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements may result in FTC enforcement, which could include the imposition of conditions, penalties,\nmonitoring, and oversight. In addition, this area of the law and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations differ and are evolving. State and federal legislatures in the U.S. and countries globally have been enacting and considering new legislation. These evolving laws and interpretations are difficult to predict and could impact our business, including by increasing compliance costs, by for example, restricting use or sharing of consumer data, including for marketing or advertising. The CCPA and related regulations is an example of a U.S. state law that imposes disclosure obligations on businesses for individuals\u2019 personal information and affords those individuals rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information. The CCPA provides for penalties and includes a private right to action for certain data breaches. The CCPA is being replaced by the CPRA, which is even more expansive, in 2023. Other new state privacy laws taking effect in 2023 include laws in Colorado and Virginia. In addition, our institutions may be subject to the GDPR, which has extensive requirements relevant to businesses handling personal information about individuals in the EU. These laws\u2019 applicability to us could result in substantial compliance costs or liabilities. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine for certain activities of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of an organization\u2019s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, per violation. Claims of failure to comply with our institutions\u2019 privacy policies or applicable laws or regulations could form the basis of governmental or private-party actions against us. Such claims and actions may cause damage to our institutions\u2019 reputation and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The enactment of additional privacy and data security laws or amendments to existing laws could result in significant costs and require us to change some of our business practices.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.\nTrading in our common stock has historically been limited and, at times, volatile. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of some or all of the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, our institutions\u2019 net course registrations or enrollments, or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022our ability to meet or exceed, or changes in, the expectations of securities analysts, or the extent or accuracy of analyst coverage of our company;\n\u2022the actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in the political environment, government policies, laws and regulations, or similar changes made by accrediting bodies;\n\u2022the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022general economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022catastrophic events;\n\u2022purchases or sales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u2022actions of others in our industry.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and monetary damages and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business, and our insurance may not be available or adequate to cover these claims.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our institutions\u2019 enrollments and associated expenses. The student population at our institutions varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, increased military operations and deployments, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns at our institutions and related fluctuations in expenses. These fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations, have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, or both.", "PERMNO": 92428, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "APEI"}
