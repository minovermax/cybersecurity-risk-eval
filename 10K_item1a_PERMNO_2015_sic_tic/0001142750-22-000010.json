Risk Factors\nYou should carefully read the following risk factors in connection with evaluating us and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows, which, in turn, could cause the price of our common stock to decline. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Factors we currently do not know, factors that we currently consider immaterial or factors that are not specific to us, such as\ngeneral economic conditions, may also materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors described below qualify all forward-looking statements we make, including forward-looking statements within this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nTo develop and prioritize the following risk factors, we review risks to our business that are informed by our formal Enterprise Risk Management program, industry trends, the external market and financial environment as well as dialogue with leaders throughout our organization. Our risk factor descriptions are intended to convey our assessment of each applicable risk and such assessments are integrated into our strategic and operational planning.\nRisk Factors that May Affect the Demand for Our Services\nThe widespread outbreak of illness or other public health crisis could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be negatively affected by the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other public health crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nDemand for our staffing services and workforce technology solutions has fluctuated significantly over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for non-essential and elective healthcare was initially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and during 2020, many hospitals and other healthcare entities significantly decreased their utilization of certain temporary healthcare professionals, interpreters, coders and permanent recruitment and placement services, which resulted in decreased demand for many of our service offerings and utilization of our workforce technology platforms. We expect that any decreased demand resulting from decreased healthcare utilization will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During 2021, demand for nurse and allied healthcare professionals reached record highs and demand for most other types of healthcare professionals we work with returned to and has recently been above pre-pandemic levels. However, with new variants emerging and varying levels of voluntary and involuntary stay-at-home and other restrictions, demand may again decrease. Additionally, as infection levels rise, individuals may forgo non-essential and elective healthcare even without restrictions which could negatively impact healthcare utilization and demand for our services. When the pandemic subsides, we expect that demand and bill rates, especially in our nurse and allied solutions businesses, will decrease from the historic levels seen during the pandemic. We expect this decrease in demand will have a negative impact on our revenue, financial condition, and results of operations. However, we are unable to predict the duration and extent to which demand for our services could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or could be negatively impacted when the pandemic subsides.\nIn addition, the significant level of individuals who left the workforce, changed jobs and/or entered the \u201cgig workforce\u201d over the last two years may cause an increase in under- and uninsured patients, which generally results in a reduction in overall healthcare utilization and a decrease in demand for our services. We are unable to predict the duration and extent to which our businesses could be negatively impacted by this shift in the labor market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and any other outbreak of illness or other public health crises, may also disrupt our operations due to the unavailability of our corporate team members or healthcare professionals due to illness, risk of illness, quarantines, travel restrictions, vaccine mandates or other factors that limit our existing or potential workforce and pool of candidates. In addition, we may experience negative financial effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic due to higher workers\u2019 compensation and health insurance costs, for which we are largely self-insured and payroll costs associated with quarantine of our healthcare professionals. We may also be subject to claims regarding the health and safety of our healthcare professionals and our corporate team members.\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the financial condition of many hospitals and healthcare systems. We may be subject to claims from these clients relating to the ability to provide services under terms and conditions that they believe are fair and reasonable.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of COVID-19. Additionally, outbreaks of illness or public health crises other than COVID-19 could occur and may have similar or even more significant impact on our business.\nEconomic downturns, inflation and slow recoveries could result in less demand from clients and pricing pressure that could negatively impact our financial condition.\nDemand for staffing services is sensitive to changes in economic activity. Many healthcare facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to accommodate an increase in hospital admissions. Conversely, when hospital admissions decrease in\neconomic downturns or periods of high inflation, due to reduced consumer spending, the demand for our temporary healthcare professionals typically declines.\nAs economic activity slows, hospitals and other healthcare entities typically experience decreased attrition and reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees, which results in decreased demand for many of our service offerings. In times of economic downturn and inflation, permanent full-time and part-time healthcare facility staff are generally inclined to work more hours and overtime, resulting in fewer available vacancies and less demand for our services. Fewer placement opportunities for our temporary clinicians, physicians and leaders also impairs our ability to recruit and place them both on a temporary and permanent basis. This may have an even greater negative effect on demand for physicians in certain specialties such as surgery, radiology and anesthesiology. In addition, we may experience pricing pressure during periods of decreased patient occupancy and hospital admissions, negatively affecting our revenue and profitability.\nDuring challenging economic times, our clients, in particular those that rely on state government funding, may face issues gaining access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us, timely or otherwise, for services rendered. If that were to occur, we may increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and quickly respond to changing marketplace conditions, such as alternative modes of healthcare delivery, reimbursement and client needs, we may not remain competitive.\nPatient delivery settings continue to evolve, giving rise to alternative modes of healthcare delivery, such as retail medicine, telemedicine and home health. In addition, changes in reimbursement models and government mandates are also impacting the healthcare environments.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop innovative workforce solutions, quickly adapt to changing marketplace conditions, such as reimbursement changes, and evolving client needs, comply with new federal or state regulations and differentiate our services and abilities from those of our competitors. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging client needs and marketplace conditions. The development of new service lines and business models requires close attention to emerging trends and proposed federal and state legislation related to the healthcare industry. If we are unable to anticipate changing marketplace conditions, adapt our current business model to adequately meet changing conditions in the healthcare industry and develop and successfully implement innovative services, we may not remain competitive.\nConsolidation of healthcare delivery organizations could negatively affect pricing of our services and increase our concentration risk.\nHealthcare delivery organizations are consolidating, providing them with greater leverage in negotiating pricing for services. Consolidations may also result in us losing our ability to work with certain clients because the party acquiring or consolidating with our client may have a previously established service provider they elect to maintain. In addition, our clients may increase their use of intermediaries such as vendor management service companies and group purchasing organizations that may enhance their bargaining power or clients with a larger network of healthcare professionals may develop their own temporary staffing models. These dynamics each separately or together could negatively affect pricing for our services and our ability to maintain certain clients.\nHospital concentration coupled with our success in winning managed services contracts means our revenues from some larger health systems have grown and may continue to grow substantially relative to our other revenue sources. For example, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (and its affiliates) (collectively, \u201cKaiser\u201d) comprised approximately 17% of our consolidated revenue in 2021. If we were to lose Kaiser as a client or were unable to provide a significant amount of services to Kaiser, whether directly or as a subcontractor, such loss may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nIntermediary organizations may impede our ability to secure new and profitable contracts with our clients.\nOur business depends upon our ability to maintain our existing contracts and secure new, profitable contracts. Outside of our managed services contracts, our client contracts are not typically exclusive and our clients are generally free to offer temporary staffing assignments to our competitors. Additionally, our clients may choose to purchase these services through intermediaries such as group purchasing organizations or competitors offering MSP services, with whom we establish relationships in order to continue to provide our staffing services to certain healthcare facilities. These intermediaries may negatively affect our ability to obtain new clients and maintain our existing client relationships by impeding our ability to access and contract directly with clients and may also negatively affect the profitability of these client relationships. In addition, our inability to establish relationships with these intermediaries may result in us losing our ability to work with certain healthcare facilities.\nThe ability of our clients to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their staffing management and recruiting efforts may affect the demand for our services that could negatively affect our business.\nIf our clients are able to increase the effectiveness of their staffing and recruitment functions through analytics, automation or otherwise, their need for our services may decline. With the advent of technology and more sophisticated staffing management and recruitment processes, including internal \u201ctravel\u201d and other healthcare staffing models, clients may be able to successfully increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their internal staffing management and recruiting efforts, through more effective planning and analytic tools, internet- or social media-based recruiting or otherwise. Such new technologies and processes could reduce the demand for our services, which could negatively affect our business.\nThe repeal or significant erosion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) without a corresponding replacement may negatively affect the demand for our services.\nIn 2010, the adoption of the ACA brought significant reforms to the health care system that included, among other things, a requirement that all individuals have health insurance (with limited exceptions). As a result of the ACA, the uninsured population has declined significantly. If there is a rollback of aspects of the ACA, such as Medicaid expansion, it may lead to a reduction in demand for healthcare services and the demand for our services may decline.\nRegulatory and Legal Risk Factors\nInvestigations, claims and legal proceedings alleging medical malpractice, anti-competitive conduct, violations of employment, privacy and wage regulations and other theories of liability asserted against us could subject us to substantial liabilities.\nLike all employers, we must also comply with various laws and regulations relating to employment and pay practices and from time to time may be subject to individual and class action lawsuits related to alleged wage and hour violations under California and Federal law. We are subject to possible claims alleging discrimination, sexual harassment and other similar activities in which we or our hospital and healthcare facility clients and their agents have allegedly engaged. We are also subject to examination of our payroll practices from various federal and state taxation authorities from time to time. While we believe that our employment and pay practices materially comply with relevant laws and regulations, interpretations of these laws may change. Because of the nature of our business, the impact of these employment and payroll laws and regulations may have a more pronounced effect on our business. There is a risk that we could be subject to payment of significant additional wages, insurance and employment, and payroll-related taxes and sizeable statutory penalties negatively impacting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These laws and regulations may also impede our ability to grow the size and profitability of our operations. In addition, our involvement in these matters and any related adverse rulings may result in increased costs and expenses, cause us from time to time to significantly increase our legal accruals and/or modify our pay practices, all of which would likely have an adverse impact on our financial performance and profitability.\nWe, along with our clients and healthcare professionals, are subject to investigations, claims and legal actions alleging malpractice or related legal theories. At times, plaintiffs name us in these lawsuits and actions regardless of our contractual obligations, the competency of the healthcare professionals, the standard of care provided by the healthcare professionals, the quality of service that we provided or our actions. In certain instances, we are contractually required to indemnify our clients against some or all of these potential legal actions.\nThe size and nature of our business requires us to collect substantial personal information of healthcare professionals and other team members that is subject to a myriad of privacy-related laws from multiple jurisdictions that regulate the use and disclosure of such information. In addition, many of our healthcare professionals have access to client proprietary information\nsystems and patient confidential information. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations with our clients. In addition, an inherent risk of the collection and access to such information includes possible claims from unintentional or intentional misuse, disclosure or use of this information. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations or charges, civil litigation, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other adverse effects on our business, which may be material.\nWe are also subject to certain laws and regulations applicable to recruitment and employment placement agencies with which we must comply in order to continue to conduct business in that specific state.\nAs we grow and increase our leadership position, we are at greater risk for anti-competitive conduct claims and investigations, such as violation of federal and state antitrust laws, unfair business practices and \u201cprice-gouging.\u201d An environment of high-demand for healthcare staffing support coupled with the healthcare labor shortage, especially with respect to nurse and allied healthcare professionals, has led and may continue to lead to higher wages for healthcare professionals and higher costs to our clients for healthcare staffing. This may lead to claims and investigations into pricing and competitive conduct in the healthcare staffing industry. While we believe that our business practices, including pricing and competitive conduct, comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we may nonetheless be subject to inquiries, claims or investigations which could negatively impact our reputation and business.\nWe maintain various types of insurance coverage for many types of claims, including professional liability, errors and omissions, employment practices and cyber, through commercial insurance carriers and a wholly-owned captive insurance company and for other claims such as wage and hour practices and competition actions, we are uninsured. The cost of defending such claims, even if groundless, could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and place qualified employees and healthcare professionals in the future. We may also experience increased insurance premiums and retention and deductible accruals that we may not be able to pass on to our clients, thereby reducing our profitability. Moreover, our insurance coverage and reserve accruals may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare industry regulation including conduct of operations, costs and payment for services and payment for referrals as well as laws regarding government contracting.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations related to conduct of operations, costs and payment for services and payment for referrals. We provide talent solutions and technologies on a contract basis to our clients, who pay us directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact us. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for our services. For example, our clients could receive reduced or no reimbursements because of a change in the rates or conditions set by federal or state governments that would negatively affect the demand and the prices for our services. Moreover, our hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients could suffer civil and criminal penalties, and be excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our profitability.\nA portion of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are state and federal government agencies, where our ability to compete for new contracts and orders, and the profitability of these contracts and orders, may be affected by government legislation, regulation or policy. Additionally, in providing services to state and federal government clients and to clients who participate in state and federal programs, we are also subject to specific laws and regulations, which government agencies have broad latitude to enforce. If we were to be excluded from participation in these programs or should there be regulatory or policy changes or modification of application of existing regulations adverse to us, it would likely materially adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to certain state laws and regulations applicable to \u201cnursing pools\u201d with which we must comply in order to continue to conduct business in that particular state and state laws that impose caps or other limitations on amounts that may be charged to clients for certain types of healthcare staffing, which in turn impacts the wages paid to healthcare professionals and may impact our ability to attract healthcare professionals to assignments in these states. In addition, it is generally our practice to pass along the increased costs associated with higher wages for healthcare professionals on to our clients. If new or additional caps or other price limitations were imposed that prevented us from passing these increased costs on or if the amount that we were able to pass on to our clients, it would likely have an adverse impact on our financial performance and profitability.\nThe challenge to the classification of certain of our healthcare professionals as independent contractors could adversely affect our profitability.\nHistorically, we have treated our locum tenens, which include physicians and certain advanced practitioners, such as certified nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, as independent contractors. Certain state laws regarding classification of independent contractors have been modified in the past few years and as a result, we have altered our classification of certain locum tenens providers in certain instances. Other states and/or the Federal government may choose to adopt similar restrictions that may require us to expand our employee classifications for locum tenens. If this occurs, it could increase our employee costs and expenses and could negatively impact our profitability.\nIn addition, Federal or state taxing authorities may take the position that locum tenens are employees exposing us to additional wage and insurance claims and employment and payroll-related taxes. A reclassification of our locum tenens to employees from independent contractors could result in liability that would have a significant negative impact on our profitability for the period in which such reclassification was implemented, and would require changes to our payroll and related business processes, which could be costly. In addition, many states have laws that prohibit non-physician owned companies from employing physicians, referred to as the \u201ccorporate practice of medicine.\u201d If our independent contractor physicians were classified as employees in states that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, we may be prohibited from conducting our locum tenens staffing business in those states under our current business model, which may have a substantial negative effect on our revenue, results of operations and profitability.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations, Personnel and Information Systems\nIf we do not continue to recruit and retain sufficient quality healthcare professionals at reasonable costs, it could increase our operating costs and negatively affect our business and our profitability.\nWe rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of healthcare professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. With rising clinician burnout rates resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, an ongoing shortage of certain qualified nurses and physicians in many areas of the United States and low unemployment rates for nurses and physicians, competition for the hiring of these professionals remains intense. Our ability to recruit temporary and permanent healthcare professionals may be exacerbated by continued low levels of unemployment.\nWe compete with healthcare staffing companies, recruitment and placement agencies, including online staffing and recruitment agencies, and with hospitals, healthcare facilities and physician practice groups to attract healthcare professionals based on the quantity, diversity and quality of assignments offered, compensation packages, the benefits that we provide and speed and quality of our service. We rely on our human capital intensive, relationship-oriented approach and national infrastructure to enable us to compete in all aspects of our business. We must continually evaluate and expand our healthcare professional network to serve the needs of our clients.\nThe costs of recruitment of quality healthcare professionals and providing them with competitive compensation packages may be higher than we anticipate, or we may be unable to pass these costs on to our hospital and healthcare facility clients, which may reduce our profitability. Moreover, if we are unable to recruit temporary and permanent healthcare professionals, our service execution may deteriorate and, as a result, we could lose clients or not meet our service level agreements with these clients that have negative financial repercussions.\nOur inability to implement new infrastructure and technology systems and technology disruptions may adversely affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe have technology, operations and human capital infrastructures to support our existing business. Our ability to deliver services to our clients and to manage our commercial technologies, internal systems and data depends largely upon our access to and the performance of our management information and communications systems, including our SaaS-based solutions, client relationship management systems and client/healthcare professional-facing self-service websites. These technology systems also maintain accounting and financial information upon which we depend to fulfill our financial reporting obligations. We must continue to invest in this infrastructure to support our growth, enhance our management and utilization of data and improve our efficiency.\nUpgrading current systems and implementing new systems is costly and involves inherent risks, including loss of information, disruption to our normal operations, changes in accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting, as well as problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in increased costs, loss of clients, healthcare professionals and talent, the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our growth, financial and operating results, internal controls over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively.\nAdditionally, the current legacy systems are subject to other non-environmental risks, including technological obsolescence for which there may not be sufficient redundancy or backup. These systems, and our access to these systems, are not impervious to floods, fire, storms, or other natural disasters, or service interruptions. There also is a potential for intentional and deliberate attacks to our systems, including ransomware, that may lead to service interruptions, data corruption, data theft or data unavailability. If our current or planned systems do not adequately support our operations, are damaged or disrupted or if we are unable to replace, repair, maintain or expand them, it may adversely affect our business operations and our profitability.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to further develop and evolve our current talent solutions technology offerings and capabilities.\nTo achieve our strategic objectives and to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our talent solutions technology offerings and capabilities. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development of new proprietary software and capabilities, either internally or through independent consultants, which may require significant investment of capital. If we are unable to design, develop, acquire, implement and utilize, in a cost-effective manner, technology and information systems that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively, or for any reason any interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities occurs, this could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruption to or failures of our SaaS-based or technology-enabled services, or our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such technologies, could reduce client satisfaction, harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nThe performance, reliability and security of our technology-enabled services, including our language interpretation services and SaaS-based technologies, such as AMN Language Services, ShiftWise, Medefis, b4health, Avantas Smart Square, Silversheet and Synzi are critical to such offerings\u2019 operations, reputation and ability to attract new clients. Some of our clients rely on our SaaS-based technologies to perform certain of their operational functions. Accordingly, any degradation, errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our SaaS-based technologies could damage our or our clients\u2019 operations and reputations and negatively affect our business. If any of these problems occur, our clients may, among other things, terminate their agreements with us or make indemnification or other claims against us, which may also negatively affect us.\nAdditionally, if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately with respect to our SaaS-based technologies, our competitors might gain access to it, and our business might be harmed. Moreover, if any of our intellectual property rights associated with our SaaS-based technologies are challenged by others or invalidated through litigation, defending our intellectual property rights might also entail significant expense. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using or infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property with respect to our SaaS-based technologies, which may negatively affect our business as it relates to our SaaS-based and technology-enabled service offerings.\nSecurity breaches and cybersecurity incidents could compromise our information and systems adversely affecting our business operations and reputation subject us to substantial liabilities.\nSecurity breaches, including cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, such as our proprietary business information and that of our clients as well as personally identifiable information of our healthcare professionals and team members, including full names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates and payroll-related information, in our data centers, on our networks and in hosted SaaS-based solutions provided by third parties. Our employees and third-party vendors may also have access to, receive and use personal health information in the ordinary course of our business. The secure access to, processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations.\nDespite our security measures and business controls, our information technology and infrastructure, including the third party SaaS-based technology in which we store personally identifiable information and other sensitive information of our healthcare professionals may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breached due to third-party vendor and/or employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions such as ransomware or subject to the inadvertent or intentional unauthorized release of information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques,\ntimely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures. Our information technology and other security protocols may not provide sufficient protection, and as a result a security reach could compromise our networks and significant information about us, our employees, healthcare professionals, patients or clients may be accessed, disclosed, lost or stolen. In a situation such as ransomware attack, our access to critical business information and ability to conduct business may be interrupted or impaired.\nAny such access, disclosure or other loss of information could (1) result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, (2) disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our clients and (3) damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our profitability, revenue and competitive position.\nThe inability to quickly and properly credential and match quality healthcare professionals with suitable placements may negatively affect demand for our services.\nOur success depends on the quality of our healthcare professionals and our ability to quickly and efficiently assist in obtaining licenses and privileges for our healthcare professionals. The speed with which our healthcare professionals can obtain the appropriate licenses, and we can credential them depends in part, on state licensing laws. Roughly 35 states are part of the Enhanced Nurse Compact and over 20 states are part of the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact and Interstate Medical Compact Acts. A decline or change in interstate compact laws can impact our business.\nOur ability to ensure the quality of our healthcare professionals also relies heavily on the effectiveness of our data and communication systems as well as properly trained and competent team members that credential and match healthcare professionals in suitable placements and third-party vendors that provide ancillary services. An inability to properly credential, match, and monitor healthcare professionals for acceptable credentials, experience and performance may cause clients to lose confidence in our services that may damage our brand and reputation and result in clients opting to utilize competitors\u2019 services or rely on their own internal resources. The costs and speed with which we provide these credentialing services impact the revenue and profitability of our business.\nOur operations may deteriorate if we are unable to continue to attract, develop and retain our sales and operations team members.\nOur success depends heavily upon the recruitment, performance and retention of diverse sales and operations team members who share our values, passion and commitment to customer focus. The number of individuals who meet our qualifications for these positions is limited, and we may experience difficulty in attracting qualified candidates, especially as we diversify our offerings and our business becomes more complex. In addition, we commit substantial resources to the training, development and support of our team members. Competition for qualified sales and operational team members in the line of business in which we operate is strong, and we may not be able to retain a sufficient number of team members after we have expended the time and expense to recruit and train them. In addition, these team members may leave to establish competing businesses.\nWe are increasingly dependent on third parties for the execution of certain critical functions.\nWe have outsourced and offshored certain critical applications or business processes to external providers, including cloud-based, credentialing and data processing services. We exercise care in the selection and oversight of these providers. However, the failure or inability to perform or adhere to law, regulation and our policies on the part of one or more of these critical suppliers or perform the services in a timely manner could cause significant disruptions and increased costs to our business as well as reputational damage.\nThe loss of key officers and management personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe believe that the success of our business strategy and our ability to maintain our recent levels of profitability depends on the continued employment of our senior executive team. We have an employment agreement with Susan R. Salka, our President and Chief Executive Officer, through May 4, 2023, which is renewable on an annual basis. Other executive members of the management team are employees at will with standard severance agreements. If members of our executive team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to maintain our positive brand awareness and identity may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have invested substantial amounts in acquiring, developing and maintaining our brands, and our success depends on our ability to maintain positive brand awareness across business lines and effectively build up or consolidate our brand awareness and image for new services. We cannot assure that additional expenditures, our continuing commitment to marketing and improving our brands and executing on our brand and marketing strategies will have the desired effect on our brands\u2019 value and may adversely affect our results of operations and also result in an impairment of the fair market value of intangible assets associated with acquired tradenames. In addition, our brands may suffer reputational damage that could negatively affect our short- and long-term financial results. The poor performance, reputation or negative conduct of competitors may have a spillover effect adversely affecting the industry and our brand.\nOur inability to consummate and effectively incorporate acquisitions into our business operations may adversely affect our long-term growth and our results of operations.\nWe invest time and resources in carefully assessing opportunities for acquisitions, and acquisitions are a key component of our growth strategy. We have made acquisitions in the past several years to broaden the scope and depth of our talent solutions. If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions, we may not achieve our long-term growth goals.\nDespite diligence and integration planning, acquisitions still present certain risks, including the time and economic costs of integrating an acquisition\u2019s technology, control and financial systems, unforeseen liabilities, and the difficulties in bringing together different work cultures and personnel. Difficulties in integrating our acquisitions, including attracting and retaining talent to grow and manage these acquired businesses, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nBusinesses we acquire may have liabilities or adverse operating issues which could harm our operating results.\nBusinesses we acquire may have liabilities or adverse operating issues, or both, that we either fail to discover through due diligence or underestimate prior to the consummation of the acquisition. These liabilities and/or issues may include the acquired business\u2019 failure to comply with, or other violations of, applicable laws, rules, or regulations or contractual or other obligations or liabilities. As the successor owner, we may be financially responsible for, and may suffer harm to our reputation or otherwise be adversely affected by, such liabilities and/or issues. These and any other costs, liabilities, issues, and/or disruptions associated with any past or future acquisitions could harm our reputation and operating results.\nIn addition, future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the obligations and liabilities of an acquired company may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of that company and the risk that those historical financial statements may be based on assumptions that are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions or approach to accounting policies. Any of these material obligations, liabilities or incorrect or inconsistent assumptions could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs we develop new services and clients, enter new lines of business, and focus more of our business on providing a full range of talent solutions, the demands on our business and our operating risks may increase.\nAs part of our strategy, we plan to extend our services to new healthcare settings, clients, and new lines of business. As we focus on developing new services, capabilities, clients, practice areas and lines of business, and engage in business in new geographic locations, our operations may be exposed to additional as well as enhanced risks.\nIn particular, our growth efforts place substantial additional demands on our management and other team members, as well as on our information, financial, administrative, compliance and operational systems. We may not be able to manage these demands successfully. Growth may require increased recruiting efforts, increased regulatory and compliance efforts, increased business development, selling, marketing and other actions that are expensive and entail increased risk. We may need to invest more in our people and systems, controls, compliance efforts, policies and procedures than we anticipate. As our business continues to evolve and we provide a wider range of services, we will become increasingly dependent upon our employees, particularly those operating in business environments less familiar to us. Failure to identify, hire, train and retain talented employees who share our values could have a negative effect on our reputation and our business.\nThe demands that our current and future growth place on our people and systems, controls, compliance efforts, policies and procedures may exceed the benefits of such growth, and our operating results may suffer, at least in the short-term, and perhaps in the long-term.\nThe expansion of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges that can cause damage to our brand and reputation.\nThere has been an increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-communication in our industry that allows access to a broad audience of interested parties. The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain media vehicles by our clients, vendors, employees and contractors could increase costs, cause damage to our brand, or result in information leakage that could lead to legal implications, including improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information of candidates and clients. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill.\nWe maintain a substantial amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet that may decrease our earnings or increase our losses if we recognize an impairment to goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe maintain goodwill on our balance sheet, which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets and intangible assets we acquired. We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists, respectively. If we identify an impairment, we record a charge to earnings. An impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets would decrease our earnings or increase our losses, as the case may be.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Indebtedness and Other Liabilities\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of any variable rate debt.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness, net of unamortized fees and premium, equaled $842.3 million. Our amount of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments, including:\n\u2022requiring a portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities,\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness,\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures,\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes, and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, if we are not in compliance with the covenants and obligations under our debt instruments, we would be in default, and the lenders could call the debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. And in certain instances, our debt instruments may limit our ability to redeem or prepay some or all of the outstanding principal amount prior to maturity, or in other instances, require the payment of premium in excess of the principal amount.\nThe terms of our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nOur debt instruments contain various covenants that could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity,\n\u2022pay dividends on, redeem, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt or make other restricted payments,\n\u2022make certain investments,\n\u2022create, or permit to exist, certain liens,\n\u2022sell assets,\n\u2022enter into sale/leaseback transactions,\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or make other payments,\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets,\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and\n\u2022designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt instruments and, in the case of our senior credit facility under our credit agreement, permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us. If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under the applicable instrument to be due and payable immediately. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Although we were in compliance with the financial ratios and financial condition tests set forth in our credit agreement on December 31, 2021, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement (and our other debt instruments to the extent the default triggers a cross default provision) and, in the case of the revolver under our credit agreement, permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such action by the lenders could cause cross-defaults under our other debt instruments.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same. In addition, on March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that 1-week and 2-week USD LIBOR will cease publication after December 31, 2021, and that 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year USD LIBOR will cease publication after June 30, 2023. Borrowing arrangements under our credit agreement provide for alternative base rates, but such alternative base rates may not be desirable or may not be available in a similar manner or frequency as LIBOR. As a result, such changes, reforms or replacements relating to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives or other financial instruments or extensions of credit held by us, which could affect our overall results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have substantial insurance-related accruals and legal accruals on our balance sheet, and any significant adverse adjustments may decrease our earnings or increase our losses and negatively impact our cash flows.\nWe maintain accruals related to legal matters, our captive insurance company and self-insured retentions for various lines of insurance coverage, including professional liability, employment practices, health insurance and workers compensation on our balance sheet. We determine the adequacy of our accruals by evaluating legal matters, our historical experience and trends, related to both insurance claims and payments, information provided to us by our insurance brokers, attorneys, third-party administrators and actuarial firms as well as industry experience and trends. If such information collectively indicates that our accruals are understated, we provide for additional accruals; a significant increase to these accruals would decrease our earnings.", "PERMNO": 89215, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "AMN"}
