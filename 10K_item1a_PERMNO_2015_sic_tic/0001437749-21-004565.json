{"cik": "42682", "company": "GORMAN RUPP CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nGorman-Rupp\u2019s business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond its control. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and access to capital markets. These risks could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical experience and from expected results discussed in forward-looking statements made by the Company related to conditions or events that it anticipates may occur in the future.\nCOMPANY SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS\nLoss of key personnel\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel to support the Company\u2019s growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. Failure to retain key management personnel and attract and retain other highly-skilled personnel could limit the Company\u2019s global growth and ability to execute operational initiatives, or may result in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which could harm the Company\u2019s revenues, operations and product development efforts and could eventually result in a decrease in profitability.\nIntellectual property security\nThe Company possesses a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and applications for the above, as well as other proprietary information. There is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, the Company\u2019s products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to the Company\u2019s, and thus potentially compete with the Company. From time to time, the Company has been faced with instances where competitors have infringed or unfairly used its intellectual property or taken advantage of its design and development efforts. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Competitors who may attempt to copy the Company\u2019s products, technologies or industrial designs are becoming more prevalent, particularly in Asia. If the Company is unable to adequately enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, it could adversely affect its revenues and profits and hamper its ability to grow.\nCompetitors and others may also challenge the validity of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or allege that it has infringed their intellectual property, including through litigation. The Company may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined its products infringe the intellectual property of others. The Company may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license (if available) on terms that are not favorable to it. Regardless of whether infringement claims against the Company are successful, defending against such claims could significantly increase the Company\u2019s costs, divert management\u2019s time and attention away from other business matters, and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquisition performance and integration\nThe Company\u2019s historical growth has depended, and its future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on its acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into existing operations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its operations. The Company cannot assure it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, the Company cannot assure that any acquisition, even if successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Company\u2019s operations and cash flows.\nImpairment in the value of intangible assets, including goodwill\nThe Company\u2019s total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, including other indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment as of October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company\u2019s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of its acquired businesses were to decline, the Company could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of these assets could have an adverse non-cash impact on the Company\u2019s reported results of operations.\nDefined benefit pension plan settlement expense\nThe Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering certain domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The defined benefit pension plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most of the Company\u2019s retirees historically have elected this option. Under applicable accounting rules, if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed an actuarially-determined threshold of the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, the Company at such point would be required to recognize for that year\u2019s results of operations settlement expense for the resulting unrecognized actuarial loss. The Company has been required to make such adjustments in some prior years, and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIn 2020 and 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charges of $4.6 million and $2.9 million respectively, driven by lump-sum distributions discussed above. There was no pension settlement charge recorded in 2019. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nFamily ownership of common equity\nA substantial percentage of the Company\u2019s common shares is held by various members of the Gorman family and their respective affiliates. Because of this concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-traded companies, the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies\u2019 shares. If any one or more of the Company\u2019s significant shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of Company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares could be negatively affected.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the present coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted our operations and may continue to affect our business, including through government imposed mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, social distancing protocols, voluntary facility closures and other government restrictions that, to the extent required, could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations. While we have largely avoided facility closures and production disruptions thus far, we may experience temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate or in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees. Our supply chain has thus far remained largely intact, however, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or worsens, it may increase disruption to our supply chain and materially adversely impact our ability to secure supplies for our facilities and production, and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially adversely affect our operations. There may also be long-term negative economic effects on our customers in, and the economies of, affected countries. Any of the foregoing within the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate may severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, future changes in the Company\u2019s cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors as a result of the above may cause the Company\u2019s goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. The negative financial impact to our future results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.\nOur internal controls may also be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A large portion of our financial and accounting personnel have been required to work from home for extended periods due to the pandemic, requiring them to adapt to new or modified processes, procedures, and controls. These changes could potentially negatively impact our internal controls over financial reporting.\nContinuation of current and projected future business environment\nThe overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company\u2019s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such investment and expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on factors such as general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in prices of commodities such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the levels of investment and expenditures of certain customers and result in postponement of capital investment decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders, either of which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales.\nHighly competitive markets\nGorman-Rupp sells its products in highly competitive markets. Maintaining and improving the Company\u2019s competitive position requires periodic investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and distribution networks. Even with such investment, the Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company\u2019s competitors may develop products that are superior to its products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of its products downward to stay competitive. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with its existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to compete successfully could negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.\nAvailability and costs of raw materials\nThe Company could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility or an inability of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements. We are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers, often with short lead times. Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to source and maintain adequate inventory levels. Raw material and energy expenses are substantial drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps and changes in these costs are often unpredictable. While the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company\u2019s business requires substantial amounts of raw materials, parts and components to be purchased from suppliers. The availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components purchased from the Company\u2019s suppliers may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production or deliveries by suppliers, changes in exchange rates, tariffs, changes in duty rates and changes in other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements. The Company may not be able to pass along any increased material costs to customers for competitive or other reasons. A change in the availability of, or increases in the price for, these raw materials, parts and components could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCyber security threats\nIncreased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of Gorman-Rupp\u2019s systems and networks and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of its networks and systems, and the deployment of backup and protective systems, the Company\u2019s systems, networks, proprietary information, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to liability for damages or the loss of confidential information including as a result of, but not limited to, the compromising of confidential information relating to customer, supplier, or employee data, improper use of the Company\u2019s systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions which, in turn, could adversely affect Gorman-Rupp\u2019s reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nCompliance with, and costs related to, a variety of import and export laws and regulations\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding international operations, including regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and various other domestic and foreign governmental agencies. Actual or alleged violations of import-export laws could result in enforcement actions and/or financial penalties. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations and trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted. Future legislation or regulations could limit the countries in which certain of our products may be manufactured or sold or could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s operations and properties are subject to numerous domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations which can impose operating and/or financial sanctions for violations. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies and may require changes to the Company\u2019s operational practices, standards and expectations and, in turn, increase the Company\u2019s compliance costs. Periodically, the Company has incurred, and it expects to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. The Company monitors its environmental responsibilities, together with trends in the related laws, and believes it is in substantial compliance with current regulations. If the Company is required to incur increased compliance costs or violates environmental laws or regulations, future environmental compliance expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nExposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, South African Rand and British Pound. Any significant change in the value of these currencies could affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nConditions in foreign countries in which the Company conducts business\nIn 2020, 29% of the Company\u2019s net sales were to customers outside the United States. The Company expects its international and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of its revenue and it has placed a particular emphasis on increasing its growth and presence internationally. The Company\u2019s sales from international operations and export sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following, some of which are further addressed in our other Risk Factors:\n\u25cf\nPossibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n\u25cf\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u25cf\nPotential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n\u25cf\nDisruption of operations from labor or political disturbances, or public health crises;\n\u25cf\nChanges in tariffs, duty rates, and other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf\nIncreased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and\n\u25cf\nInsurrections, armed conflicts, terrorism or war.\nAny of these events could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nChanges in our tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities\nGorman-Rupp is subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates as well as rules and regulations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, the Company\u2019s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments.", "PERMNO": 53604, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "GRC"}
