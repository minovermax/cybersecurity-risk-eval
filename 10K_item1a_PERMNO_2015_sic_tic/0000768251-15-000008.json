RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors, among others that are not presently known or that we currently believe unimportant, could affect our future results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Before you decide to buy, hold, or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider these risks, in addition to the other information contained in this report. Our business, financial condition, and operations results could be seriously harmed if any of the events described here actually occurs. In that situation, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\nSemiconductor companies, such as Altera, experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability. The semiconductor industry has experienced economic downturns and business contractions from time to time, which can be severe and prolonged. The fluctuations follow the turns of the global economy and in a downturn can result in significant reductions in product demand and excess customer inventories. Global economic weakness or cyclical downturns have previously resulted from periods of economic recession, reduced access to credit markets, weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, weak end-user demand, excess industry capacity or general reductions in inventory levels by customers. It is difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities in today's global economy.\nOur ability to predict the quantity and type of products our customers will need in the future is limited because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management. These factors could affect the timing of customer orders and the overall level of demand for our products. Because it is extremely difficult to forecast the success or timing of a customer's product, and because our end markets are highly fragmented (we have over 12,600 PLD customers), our ability to forecast end customer demand is limited. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell as quickly as estimated, if at all. As a result we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our customers' business and their ability to access financing, which could adversely affect demand for our products. Our operating cash flows are highly dependent on the continued collection of receivables and our ability to sell our products. Declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of our receivables. In addition to reductions in sales and elevated risk associated with the collection of receivables, our profitability and cash flows may suffer during downturns because we may not be able to reduce costs at the same rate as our sales decline.\nAs further described below, we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers and to assemble, test and ship our semiconductor products. Uncertainties in the capital and credit market may adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations. If our subcontractors' capital structures weaken, they may fail to satisfy our demand and our business could be materially disrupted.\nIf global economic and market conditions remain uncertain or persist, spread or deteriorate further, we could experience a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors.\nOur gross margins may fluctuate due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nGeographic and vertical market pricing mix\n\u2022\nChanges in the mix of our prototyping and production-based business\n\u2022\nCompetitive pricing dynamics and customer mix\n\u2022\nVarious manufacturing cost variables including product yields, wafer prices, package and assembly costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and absorption of manufacturing overhead\nOur ongoing efforts to manage these factors may not be successful, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in our gross margins.\nOur failure to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry would adversely affect our financial results and business prospects.\nThe semiconductor industry, including the PLD market, is intensely competitive. Our ability to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry depends on our ability to provide our customers with solutions providing greater value than those offered by competing programmable logic vendors, such as Xilinx and Lattice, and other semiconductor companies that indirectly compete with us. Because we develop PLDs for applications that are presently served by ASIC, ASSP, FPGA, CPLD, DSP, and microprocessor/microcontroller vendors, we compete against these vendors. From time to time, we have had customers convert high-volume designs to ASICs. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Other competitors include manufacturers of:\n\u2022\nHigh-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures\n\u2022\nHigh-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs\n\u2022\nASICs and ASSPs\n\u2022\nHigh-speed, low-density CPLDs\n\u2022\nMicroprocessors and microcontrollers\n\u2022\nPowerSoCs\n\u2022\nMany-core processors and network processors\n\u2022\nHigh-performance DSP devices\n\u2022\nProducts with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers\n\u2022\nOther new or emerging programmable logic products\nMany of these competitors have substantially more financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and have well-established market positions and solutions that have proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades. We may be unable to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities. Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment.\nThe highly competitive environment of the semiconductor industry and the high costs associated with manufacturing technologies and developing marketable products have resulted in significant consolidation in the industry and are likely to lead to further consolidation. We may become a target for a company looking to improve its competitive position. Such an occurrence may take place at any time with consequences that may not be predictable and that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and investments that may disrupt our business if not successfully integrated and could potentially harm our operating results.\nWe have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments, alliances and acquisitions that we consider necessary or desirable to gain access to key technologies that we believe will complement our existing technical capabilities and support our business model objectives. Acquisitions, alliances and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future financial performance. These risks include difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business and failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the anticipated financial or strategic benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows that we currently do not foresee.\nA downturn in the communications equipment end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results.\nApproximately 44% of our net sales for 2014 was derived from customers participating in the Telecom and Wireless vertical market. In the past, a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue. Any deterioration in the communications end market or reduction in capital spending to support this end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe length of our design-in and sales cycles could affect our ability to forecast future sales.\nOur sales depend on our products being designed into end customers' products, and on those products being produced in volume. Our products are very complex, and the time from design-in to volume production ranges from six months to three years or more. From initial product design-in to volume production, many factors can affect the timing and/or volume of our sales. These factors include changes in the competitive position of our technology, the competitiveness of our end customers' products in the markets they serve, our customers' financial stability, end customer program delays and cancellations, and our ability to ship products according to customer schedules.\nOur business is characterized by a general decline in semiconductor product selling prices that may materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe selling prices of our products have decreased over time. We have offset the selling price decreases by reducing manufacturing costs, improving yields and increasing unit sales. However, our ongoing efforts may not be successful or may not keep pace with the anticipated, continued decline in product selling prices, which could ultimately reduce revenues and gross margins.\nBecause we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-U.S. laws, regulations and customs. During 2014, sales outside of the U.S. and Canada constituted approximately 84% of our net sales, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales. Risks related to our foreign operations include:\n\u2022\nUnfavorable economic, market, political and social conditions in a specific country or region\n\u2022\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates\n\u2022\nIncreased freight costs\n\u2022\nInterruptions in air transportation\n\u2022\nReduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries\n\u2022\nLonger receivable collection periods\n\u2022\nNatural or man-made disasters in the countries or regions where we sell our products\n\u2022\nDifferent labor regulations\nWe must comply with a variety of foreign laws and we experience risks associated with legislation and regulations for importing and exporting semiconductor products. In the future, the United States or other countries may impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other charges, restrictions or trade barriers for the import or export of our products.\nWe rely heavily on distributors to generate a significant portion of our sales and fulfill our customer orders. The failure of our distributors to perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales.\nWorldwide sales through distributors accounted for 73% of our net sales during 2014. During 2014, Arrow Electronics, Inc. and its affiliates (\"Arrow\") accounted for approximately 39% of net sales on a worldwide basis, while our next-largest distributor, Macnica, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cMacnica\u201d), accounted for approximately 22% of net sales. As of December 31, 2014, accounts receivable from Arrow and Macnica individually accounted for 34% and 47%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable. We rely on many distributors to help us create end customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to end customers, fill customer orders and stock our products. Our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nOur distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions. Lower sales, lower earnings, debt downgrades, the inability to access capital markets and higher interest rates could potentially affect our distributors' operations.\nOur ability to add or replace distributors is limited.\nWe contract with distributors to perform two primary, yet distinct, functions that are difficult to replace:\n\u2022\nDistributors provide logistics support, such as order entry, credit, forecasting, inventory management and shipment of product, to end customers. The process of integrating systems to allow for electronic data interchange is complex and can be time consuming.\n\u2022\nDistributors create demand for our products at the engineering level. This mandates the training of an extended distributor sales force, as well as hiring and training specialized applications engineers skilled in promoting and servicing products at the engineering level.\nOur distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels may not be easily transferable to a new distributor. In addition, a significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nAs a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor.\nWe rely on independent foundries to supply us with finished silicon wafers. Independent foundry capacity and the failure to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business.\nThe majority of our silicon wafers are currently produced by TSMC in its manufacturing facilities located primarily in Taiwan and the U.S. Intel will manufacture the silicon wafers for our Stratix 10 FPGAs and SoC FPGAs in the future. Silicon wafer production facilities have a fixed capacity that is allocated solely by our vendors and beyond our direct control. We have no formalized long-term supply or allocation commitments from TSMC or Intel. Our operations would be disrupted if either foundry ended its relationship with us and we were unable to arrange a satisfactory and cost-effective alternative to quickly fulfill customer orders.\nTo ensure continued wafer supply, we may establish other wafer supply sources as these arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary. However, only a few foundry vendors have the capability to manufacture our most advanced products. If we engage alternative supply sources, we may encounter start-up difficulties and incur additional costs. In addition, shipments could be significantly delayed while these sources are qualified for volume production.\nFurthermore, because we rely on third-party foundry vendors, we have little or no direct control over production costs, delivery schedules and wafer quality. We also face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nWafer shortages and/or increased wafer and assembly material costs could lower our gross margins, reduce our sales or otherwise materially disrupt our business.\nIf market demand for silicon wafers or assembly material suddenly exceeds market supply, our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited. A shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand. Moreover, silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost. If we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices, our gross margins will be adversely affected.\nProduct manufacturing is complex, and we may not achieve the necessary yields or product reliability that our business requires.\nManufacturing our products is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled environment. We depend not only on sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices, but also on good production yields (the number of good die per wafer) and timely wafer delivery to meet customer demand and maintain profit margins. Wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used, and the performance of personnel and equipment. As a result, we may experience problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors.\nDifficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin new product production, when we transition to new processes or when our wafer suppliers move production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another or manufactures the same product at multiple factories. As a result of manufacturing defects, TSMC has also occasionally scrapped wafers, resulting in longer manufacturing lead times. Further, production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer\nsuppliers, and we may occasionally experience production delays. These difficulties and delays can potentially cause significantly higher costs and lower product availability.\nWe depend on independent subcontractors to assemble, test and ship our semiconductor products. The failure of these subcontractors to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business.\nBecause we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble, test and ship our semiconductor products and to provide package piece parts, we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels. We depend on sufficient subcontractor assembly and test capacities, both in raw materials and services, to meet the demand for our products. Our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors. If market demand for subcontractor material and services exceeds available supply or if the subcontractors' capital structures weaken, we may experience product shortages, quality assurance problems and/or increased manufacturing costs.\nConditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations and thereby adversely interrupt our manufacturing and sales processes.\nThe economic, market, social and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and distributors are located are unpredictable and could have a significant impact on our business if we were unable to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner. Market and political conditions (including currency fluctuation, terrorism, political strife, war and labor disruption), natural or man-made disasters, adverse changes in tax laws, tariffs, import or export quotas, power and water shortages or interruption in air transportation in areas where our independent subcontractors and distributors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities.\nOur failure to define, develop and manufacture technologically advanced products would adversely affect the success and growth of our company.\nWe operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change. Our products are manufactured using a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled environment. Our current product development efforts focus on developing new PLDs, related development software and hardware and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes. Our development efforts may impact the timely introduction of competitive new products or product enhancements. Additionally, we may not be successful in developing new products or using and converting established products to new and more advanced process technologies. For example, our current generation product families, including the Stratix V family, are manufactured on a 28-nanometer process technology, but our next-generation product families will be manufactured on smaller circuit geometries that we have not used before. The use of advanced process technology has technological risks and start-up difficulties that can adversely affect research and development spending, yields, product costs and product delivery timeliness.\nOur ability to service our debt obligations requires sufficient cash flow from our future operations.\nOn October 29, 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior notes (the \"2.50% Notes\") due in 2018 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.10% senior notes (the \"4.10% Notes\") due in 2023. In 2012, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes (the \"1.75% Notes\") due in 2017. All three of our senior notes (the \"Notes\") pay a fixed rate of interest semiannually and we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time for cash at the redemption prices described in the indentures. Our debt obligations may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the Notes, and may limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us. Overall, our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio consists of investment grade securities, and our investment policy is designed to minimize risk and preserve principal. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to certain asset classes and financial instruments. However, our cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio represents significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate\nmovements, changes in credit rating, and financial market conditions. Thus, even though we have not realized any significant losses on our cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio, we may suffer losses in principal in the future if we sell securities that decline in market value.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program at all or in any particular amount.\nIn recent years, we have made quarterly dividend payments. We intend to continue to pay such dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders. Our dividend may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all. Furthermore, in 2013, our board of directors increased the share repurchase program authorization, which has no specified expiration. We believe that this authorization is sufficient to support our share repurchase objectives in the near-term. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase our share repurchase authorization in any particular amounts or at all in the future. Future dividends and increases to our stock repurchase program may be affected by, among other factors, changes to our business model and the funding of research and development. A reduction in our dividend or in our share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nFailure of our information technology systems to function properly, or unauthorized access to our systems, could result in significant business disruption.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems to manage our business. We evaluate our business processes and our IT systems on an ongoing basis and make periodic enhancements to our business processes and the functionality of our IT systems. In connection with these enhancements, we modify our processes and controls to ensure continued reliability and integrity of our business processes and related IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced processes, systems or controls could adversely affect our ability to generate accurate financial and management information in a timely manner. These systems are also susceptible to power and telecommunication disruptions and other system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption.\nWe also may face the risk of unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or attack. We strive to identify and investigate any such security incidents and prevent their recurrence. However, in certain cases, there may be undetected incidents or the impact of identified incidents may not be fully understood. Our business could be significantly disrupted and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of a significant security breach.\nAny prolonged disruption to our global communications infrastructure could impair our ability to plan production activity and respond to customer demand.\nDemand for our products is highly volatile, especially at the detailed ordering code level. To achieve short delivery lead times and superior levels of customer service while maintaining low levels of inventory, we constantly adjust our manufacturing subcontractors' production schedules. We develop and adjust these schedules based on end-customer demand as communicated by our distributors and based on our inventory levels, manufacturing cycle times, component lead times, and projected production yields. We combine and distribute all of this information electronically over a complex global communications network. Our ability to estimate demand and to adjust our production schedules is highly dependent on this network; we have no manual back-up. A prolonged disruption or service failure in a portion of this network would impair our ability to plan production activity and respond to demand.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins and net income.\nWe produce highly complex hardware and software products that incorporate leading-edge technology. Our pre-shipment testing programs may not detect all defects. Because our product warranties against materials and workmanship defects and non-conformance to our specifications are for varying lengths of time, we have occasionally been required to replace components or refund the purchase price paid due to product defects. If the costs for customer or warranty claims increase significantly compared with our historical experience, our revenue, gross margins and net income may be adversely affected. For example, if we cannot fix a product defect in a timely manner, we may incur product re-engineering expenses, increased inventory costs or damage to our reputation, any of which could materially affect our revenue, gross margins and net income.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nOur devices are used in automotive, communication, military, aerospace, avionics, medical equipment and other systems where system failure could cause damage to property or people. We may receive product liability claims if our devices cause system failures. Based on our historical experience, we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low, but could be higher if either the sales volume in these applications or the frequency of system failures caused by our devices increases.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events.\nOur corporate headquarters in San Jose, California is located near major earthquake faults. Some of our international facilities and those of our key suppliers, including TSMC, which produces our silicon wafers, are also located near major earthquake faults. Any catastrophic event, such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, could make it difficult for Altera and our independent subcontractors to meet product design deadlines, maintain our records, pay our suppliers, or manufacture or ship our products. Any catastrophic event could also affect our customers or potential customers, which could reduce or delay orders and ultimately decrease our revenue.\nAs we carry only limited insurance coverage, any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents, and we do not have coverage for certain losses. We believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice and economic and availability considerations. If our insurance coverage is inadequate to protect us against unforeseen catastrophic losses, any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A change in our effective tax rate could have a significant adverse impact on our business, and an adverse outcome resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, by transfer pricing adjustments, by expiration of or lapses in the U.S. Research and Development (\u201cR&D\u201d) tax credit and other various foreign credits and incentives, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, by acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and by any potential decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. We are subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nIn light of ongoing fiscal challenges in the U.S. and many countries in Europe, various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including corporate income taxes. These potential changes in the relevant tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals along with potential changes in accounting and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could impact our effective tax rate. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association of 34 countries including the United States, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Among the options have been a range of proposals included in the tax and budget policies recommended to the U.S. Congress by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to modify the federal tax rules related to the imposition of U.S. federal corporate income taxes for companies operating in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. These contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nCompliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nRecently there has been increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives. Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 requires the SEC to promulgate new disclosure requirements for manufacturers of products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. The new disclosure rules were effective in 2013 and required us to file a form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission by May 31, 2014. The ongoing compliance with these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the metals used in the manufacture of our products. The regulations may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Finally, some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to consistently verify that the metals used in our products are free of conflict minerals.\nOur failure to protect and defend our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete effectively.\nWe rely on patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and mask work laws to protect our intellectual property, proprietary information and technology rights. As of December 31, 2014, we owned more than 3,300 U.S. patents and 550 foreign patents, and had more than 1,200 patents applications pending worldwide. Our patents and patent applications may not protect us from our competition, which may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our products. In addition, other parties, including our former employees or consultants, may try to disclose, obtain or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization despite our best efforts at prevention. If other companies obtain this information or develop similar information or technologies, they may develop products that compete against ours.\nMoreover, the laws of certain countries where we sell, manufacture or distribute products may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent misappropriation of our technology. If others use our proprietary rights, it could materially harm our business and require expensive litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on third-party vendors in the development of our new products. The inability of these third-party vendors to provide technologies that satisfy our customers' demands could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products and product enhancements. Furthermore, certain product features in our new or existing products may rely on third-party intellectual property embedded in our products. Unavailability or inadequacy of third-party software development tools and other intellectual property necessary to meet our customers' demands may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins, either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating results.\nIntellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nWe occasionally receive inquiries about possible patent infringements that may require us to obtain licenses relating to our current or future products. We may be unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, or the license agreements may have set durations or may not provide complete protection against infringement claims involving all of our current or future products. If we are sued for patent infringement, the costs and outcome of litigation will be unpredictable and may have a negative impact on our financial results. Intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, can result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Legal proceedings are also unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control. If our defense against intellectual property infringement claims is unsuccessful, we may be required to pay significant monetary damages or be subject to an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families. Alternatively, we could be required to spend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, the success of which may be uncertain. Intellectual property litigation may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75577, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ALTR.1"}
