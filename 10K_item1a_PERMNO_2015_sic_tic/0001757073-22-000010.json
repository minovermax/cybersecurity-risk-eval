risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the current outbreak of COVID-19. To date, COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, our supply chains and distribution systems, and our revenues and expenses, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, our dental customers, other businesses, and governments are taking. While the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines throughout 2021 mitigated mortality risk, new COVID-19 variants, particularly the Delta and Omicron variants, proved to remain a threat. The lifting of lockdowns in certain areas started a slow economic recovery. The resulting increase in consumer demand has created significant challenges for supply chains as a result of labor and raw material shortages, which could lead to reduced earnings for many industries. The majority of dental practices have reopened; however, overall patient volume remains below pre-COVID-19 levels. As dental practices reopened, dental associations have recommended enhanced safety, disinfection and social distancing protocols. These measures may remain in place for a significant period of time in certain regions and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced significant business disruptions, including restrictions on our ability to travel and distribute our products, temporary closures of most of our facilities, temporary reduced production capacity at certain sites when there are local outbreaks causing higher than usual employee absences due to illness or quarantine requirements, as well as reduction in access to our customers due to prolonged shelter-in-place and/or self-quarantine mandates. As more business and activities have shifted online and most of our employees are working remotely due to these restrictions, we may also be more vulnerable to cyber security threats and attempts to breach our security networks. These unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and health care authorities globally have had, and will continue to have, a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results.\nMoreover, efforts to slow or prevent a recurrence of the spread of the virus are likely to continue to curtail the operations of our customers and their patients for an indeterminate period of time, impacting our operations as purchasing decisions are delayed or lost, increasing logistical complexities as a result of closed customer offices, sales and marketing efforts are postponed, and certain of our manufacturing operations are curtailed to adjust to declining sales. Our businesses could also be impacted should the disruptions from COVID-19 lead to changes in consumer behavior and spending, and our business may be particularly susceptible to these changes as a material portion of our products may be viewed as discretionary purchases and therefore more susceptible to any global or regional recession that may result from efforts to prevent or delay the spread of the virus. Any such global or regional recessions or economic slowdowns could also increase the risk of customer defaults or delays in payments. Additionally, the COVID-19 impact on the capital markets could affect our cost of borrowing and our ability to raise additional capital. There are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of these items, including the fixed costs of our manufacturing facilities. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses, particularly over the near to medium term.\nOur future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, supply chain disruptions and uncertain demand, and the impact of any initiatives or programs that we may undertake to address financial and operations challenges faced by our customers. Furthermore, pursuant to the Defense Production Act, the federal government may, among other things, require us to provide essential goods and services needed for the national defense as part of the federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic. The invocation of the Defense Production Act may impact our ability to effectively conduct our business operations as planned, either as a result of becoming directly subject to the requirements of the Defense Production Act, our suppliers becoming so subject and diverting deliveries of raw materials elsewhere, or otherwise, and any resulting disruption on our ability to conduct business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn response to the negative impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business, we implemented various cost reduction initiatives. Future cost savings initiatives and other measures related to stopping the spread of COVID-19 could also adversely affect our research and development activities, which could negatively impact our growth strategies. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market our products.\nAs part of our efforts to reduce costs to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, we took several actions related to our employees, including implementing temporary furloughs and reduced work schedules for a substantial number of our employees, implementing pay reductions, and reducing our overall workforce. Such steps, and further changes we may make in the future to reduce costs, may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees. In addition, we have experienced COVID-19 cases among our workforce, and we could experience a wider-spread outbreak of COVID-19 in our manufacturing facilities, which could require us to temporarily shut down manufacturing operations and/or cause a disruption to, or shortage in, our workforce. If a widespread outbreak were to occur, we may experience delays in our responses to our customers and possible delays in shipments of our products, which could adversely impact our competitive positioning, sales and relationships with our customers. We may also face demands or requests from labor unions that represent our employees, whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements, through bargaining relating to the shut down and/or reopening of our operations, or otherwise. We could also be materially adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address employment-related matters, including any employment-related litigation, or maintain satisfactory relations with our employees.\nOur amended credit agreement, dated as of June 15, 2021, by and among us and a syndicate of banks (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d) contains covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and, if not met, may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Moreover, the terms of the Credit Agreement require us to satisfy certain financial covenants. Should our future business and operations be significantly impaired by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions over an extended period of time or otherwise, we may be unable to remain in compliance with our current financial covenants. In such event, the factors that adversely affect our business may also similarly adversely affect the capital markets, and we cannot assure that we would be able to negotiate alternative covenants or alternative financing on favorable terms if at all. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, including financial covenants, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic, including uncertainty regarding the vaccine distribution and timing and the various mutations of the virus, and the continuing or additional measures that governmental authorities may take to mitigate it, as well as the uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we are unable to estimate the extent of the impacts on our operations and financial results.\nMoreover, many risk factors set forth herein should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nConditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nOur business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures, social or political unrest, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges that affect the global economy may adversely affect us and our distributors, customers and suppliers. Our success also depends upon the continued strength of the markets we serve. In many markets, dental reimbursement is largely out of pocket for the consumer and thus utilization rates can vary significantly depending on economic growth. While many of our products are considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment, certain products and services that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to changes in economic conditions. The above factors can have the effect of:\n\u25e6reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;\n\u25e6increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n\u25e6increasing price competition in our served markets;\n\u25e6supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products;\n\u25e6increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets;\n\u25e6increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and\n\u25e6adversely impacting market sizes.\nThere can be no assurance that the capital markets will be available to us or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.\nSignificant developments or uncertainties stemming from trade policies and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nTrade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets.\nIn particular, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions.\nTrade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and supply chains, and decoupling of global trade networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.\nOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nOur growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into these markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may also experience periodic, cyclical downturns.\nIn addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers\u2019 capital spending budgets, government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, which can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.\nOur financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.\nAs further discussed in the section entitled \u201cItem 1. Business-Materials,\u201d our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.\nWe purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.\nIn addition, some of our businesses purchase certain materials, components and services from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, including COVID-19, war, terrorist actions, widespread protests and civil unrest, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. For example, we are experiencing higher prices on certain petroleum-based supplies/chemicals and microchips due to current global supply chain issues. Failure to obtain the needed supply of these products or to offset the increased costs could adversely impact our operating results.\nBecause we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs, liability and lost sales, loss of market share as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.\nInventories maintained by our distributors and customers may fluctuate from time to time.\nWe rely in part on our distributor and customer relationships and predictions of distributor and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results. These inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from our predictions, resulting in our projections of future results being different than expected. These changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the distributor and customers, economic conditions, supply chain disruption and end-user preference for particular products. There can be no assurance that our distributors and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with our predictions or past history, or that the timing of distributors\u2019 or customers\u2019 inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with our predictions or past history.\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of our sales, and loss of a key distributor could result in a loss of a significant amount of our sales. In addition, adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our sales had come from a limited number of distributors, particularly Henry Schein, which accounted for approximately 12% of our sales in 2021 and 11% of our sales in 2020. It is anticipated that Henry Schein will continue to be the largest contributor to our sales for the foreseeable future. We do not currently have a master distribution agreement in place with Henry Schein for the distribution of our products in the U.S. and Canada. There can be no assurance that Henry Schein or any particular distributor will purchase any particular quantity of products from us or continue to purchase any products at all. If Henry Schein or any other key distributor or channel partner significantly reduces the volume of products purchased from us, it would have an adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements.\nOur key distributors and other channel partners typically have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors\u2019 products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and consolidated and combined financial statements.\nOur growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.\nWe generally sell our products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u25e6correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n\u25e6allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;\n\u25e6anticipate and respond to our competitors\u2019 development of new products and services and technological innovations;\n\u25e6differentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings and avoid commoditization;\n\u25e6innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;\n\u25e6obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;\n\u25e6successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;\n\u25e6obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where required); and\n\u25e6stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.\nIf we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant sales, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nEven if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. For additional information on third-party reimbursement of dental products, please refer to \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data, confidential business information, health information, intellectual property, and personal data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our software products and services incorporate information technology that may house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers may connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes.\nThese systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) may be materially impacted and/or disrupted by information security incidents such as ransomware, malware, viruses, phishing, social engineering, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. This existing risk is potentially compounded given the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to work-from-home arrangements for a majority of our employees and the related increase in remote access to our systems. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of our systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third parties\u2019 systems on which we rely to process, store, or transmit electronic information, could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. Additionally, if our business relationship with a third-party provider of information technology systems or services is negatively affected, or if one of our providers were to terminate its agreement with us without adequate notice, we would suffer a significant business disruption.\nAny of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners; delay production and shipments; result in theft of our and our customers\u2019 intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships; harm our reputation; result in defective products or services; or lead to legal claims, proceedings, liability and penalties. These events may also result in increased costs for security and remediation. All of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nIf we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences, fines, business disruption and litigation.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate and alleviate problems caused by security incidents, including unauthorized access to protected health information and personal information stored in our information systems, and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected by these events and any resulting federal and state fines and penalties, legal claims or proceedings, and cancellation of contracts if security breaches are not prevented. The healthcare industry is currently experiencing increased attention on compliance with regulations that require us to safeguard protected health information and mitigate cyber-attacks. There are also significant costs associated with a data breach, including investigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorney fees, and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a loss in confidence. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential data breach, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our business reputation.\nWe have installed privacy/security protection systems and devices on our network in an attempt to prevent cyber-threats and other unauthorized access to information. However, there can be no assurance that any such threats or unauthorized access will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. In addition, our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential and personal information we maintain. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to individuals and regulators, which could result in fines, litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are not held liable, any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats, increased regulatory enforcement and the expansion of consumer rights under data privacy and security laws.\nWe believe that our subcontractors and vendors take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our business operations as a result of failure or disruption to their information systems. However, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a disruption, and it is possible that we may be impacted by information system failures. The occurrence of any information system failures with our vendors could result in interruptions, delays, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems. All of these events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and they could harm our business reputation.\nData privacy and security laws relating to the handling of personal information (including personal health information) are evolving across the world and may be drafted, interpreted or applied in a manner that results in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, reputational damage or impedes delivery.\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) privacy, security, and breach notification rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of patient health information. In addition, individual states regulate data breach notification requirements as well as more general privacy and security requirements. Entities within the United States that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, for example as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.\nBased on the annual revisions for 2021, penalties for HIPAA violations can range from $120 to $1.807 million dollars per violation, with a maximum fine of $1.807 million for identical violations during a calendar year. In 2018, a nation-wide health benefit company paid $16 million to HHS following a data breach. Prior to this record payment, the largest HIPAA fine was $5.55 million. Under the law, state attorneys general have authority to bring civil enforcement actions under HIPAA, and attorneys general are actively engaged in enforcement. In addition, any penalties assessed under HIPAA could be in addition to other penalties assessed by a state for a data breach in violation of state laws.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (\u201cHITECH\u201d) Act was enacted as an update to HIPAA and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable for compliance with certain HIPAA requirements, strengthens the limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information without individual authorizations, and contemplates enforcement of noncompliance with HIPAA due to willful neglect. These changes have stimulated increased enforcement activity and enhanced the potential that health care providers will be subject to financial penalties for violations of HIPAA. In addition, the Secretary of HHS is required to perform periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action.\nIn addition to the federal HIPAA regulations, most states also have laws that protect the confidentiality of health information and other personal information, and these laws may be broader in scope with respect to protected health information and other personal information than HIPAA. Certain of these laws grant individuals various rights with respect to personal information, and we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with these laws. Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected persons and/or state regulators in the event of a data breach or compromise, including when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person.\nSome state breach notification laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information, such as social security numbers and bank and credit card account numbers. Violation of state privacy, security, and breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties. In addition, certain states\u2019 privacy, security, and data breach laws, including, for example, the CPRA, and include private rights of action that may expose us to private litigation regarding our privacy and security practices and significant damages awards or settlements in civil litigation.\nIn addition, as federal, state and local governments consider adopting new privacy and security legislation, our operations may be subject to different standards in different geographical regions. This may require significantly more resources for compliance and increase the risk of regulatory enforcement and private litigation with respect to our privacy and security practices.\nWe are also subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), the primary data protection law in the European Union and European Economic Area (collectively, the EU), as well as associated EU member state data protection laws and the UK GDPR in the United Kingdom. These laws impose significant requirements for covered businesses (controllers and processors) of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals, a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary uses of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., deidentified) data, restrictions on data transfers outside of the EU, and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states certain flexibility to make additional laws and regulations concerning the same issues, including, for example, further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may result in fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Other administrative penalties may be imposed under the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states.\nWe rely on legal mechanisms for transferring certain personal data outside of the EU. These mechanisms include the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, and until July 2020, the U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued the \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision, invalidating the Privacy Shield Framework and requiring additional due diligence and assessments to be carried out when using Standard Contractual Clauses as transfer mechanisms. This decision has created uncertainty in how businesses may transfer data out of the EU and may result in increased costs and complexity and hinder our transfer of data out of the EU and corresponding business operations.\nOther countries (for example Brazil and China) have or are in the process of passing laws that contain similar requirements to the GDPR. Data localization laws have also been passed or are under consideration in several countries (such as China and Russia), which require personal information relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions.\nCompliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the United States and around the world have required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures and changes in our products or business models that increase complexity and competition. We may also experience less demand for our product if we are unable to engineer these to enable our customers to comply with their obligations under data privacy laws.\nIn addition, government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nAny inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.\nOur ability to grow sales, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions and investments may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.\nOur acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.\nAs part of our business strategy we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course; please refer to \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional details. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements:\n\u25e6Any business, technology, service or product that we acquire or invest in could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to operate any such business profitably.\n\u25e6We may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which could also cause a deterioration of our credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets.\n\u25e6Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community\u2019s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.\n\u25e6Pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.\n\u25e6Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.\n\u25e6We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.\n\u25e6We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship.\n\u25e6We may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company\u2019s or investee\u2019s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.\n\u25e6In connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.\n\u25e6As a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the fair value of our investments declines, we may be required to incur impairment charges.\n\u25e6We may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.\n\u25e6Investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we may not achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.\nOur ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments. For example, a number of countries, including the U.S. and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.\nCertain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.\nWe may not complete the proposed IOS Acquisition on the anticipated timeline or at all.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the IOS Acquisition. For example, the IOS Acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the timeframe, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the failure of one or more of the conditions to closing in the Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the IOS Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the IOS Acquisition. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by the parties thereto under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if the IOS Acquisition has not been completed by December 31, 2022. Any delay in closing the IOS Acquisition or a failure to close the IOS Acquisition could have a negative impact on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the IOS Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the Intraoral Scanner Business into our operations.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the IOS Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Intraoral Scanner Business into ours. We may devote significant management attention and resources preparing for and then integrating the business practices and operations of the Intraoral Scanner Business with ours. This integration process may be disruptive to our and the Intraoral Scanner businesses, and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict realization of the expected benefits. In addition, we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of the IOS Acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include:\n\u2022The inability to successfully combine operations in a manner that would result in the anticipated benefits of the IOS Acquisition in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022Complexities associated with managing the expanded operations and new products;\n\u2022Integrating personnel;\n\u2022Creation of uniform standards, internal controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022Unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory issues associated with integrating the operations and products into our portfolio; and\n\u2022Performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management attention caused by completing the integration of the operations.\nEven if we are able to integrate the Intraoral Scanner Business successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits that we currently expect, nor can we give assurances that these benefits will be achieved when expected or at all. Moreover, the integration of the Intraoral Scanner Business may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, regulatory risks and competitive responses that could have material adverse consequences. In addition, we are aware of pending litigation against the seller of the Intraoral Scanner Business, and while we do not view this litigation as material, the defense of such litigation, and any other future claims that may arise, may require significant time, attention and resources of our management and other employees within the Company, potentially diverting their attention from our business.\nWe and the Intraoral Scanner Business will be subject to business uncertainties while the IOS Acquisition is pending that could adversely affect our business and the Intraoral Scanner Business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the IOS Acquisition on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us and the Intraoral Scanner Business. Although we and the Sellers intend to take actions to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us and/or the Intraoral Scanner Business to seek to change existing business relationships. In addition, employee retention could be negatively impacted during the pendency of the IOS Acquisition. If key employees depart because of concerns relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of the integration process, our business could be harmed.\nThe pendency of the IOS Acquisition could adversely affect our business, financial results, and operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the IOS Acquisition could cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding our business and affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources to complete the IOS Acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Investor perceptions about the terms or benefits of the IOS Acquisition could have a negative impact on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse tax, financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to certain businesses or assets we or our predecessors have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the Divestiture of our KaVo Treatment Unit and Instrument Business and the transition services to be provided by us to Planmeca for a limited time may draw attention and resources away from our ongoing business.\nOn December 31, 2021, we closed the Divestiture; however we may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits and our future investments and other business opportunities that we anticipate will be facilitated by the Divestiture may not be successful and may prove not to be superior alternatives to the continued operation of the KaVo Treatment Unit and Instrument Business. Further, the purchase agreement governing the Divestiture requires our provision of transition services to Planmeca throughout a transition period, which will require significant time, attention and resources of our management and other employees within the Company, potentially diverting their attention from other aspects of our business. We will be bound to comply with the terms of the transition services agreement, and at times compliance with this agreement will consume our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining and growing our business.\nWe are in the process of rebranding our Imaging Business, our China Business, and many of our products, which will likely involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by our customers.\nWe no longer own the \u201cKaVo\u201d brand name, or any variation of the name, logos or related intellectual property rights. We will likely incur substantial costs to rebrand our Imaging Business, our China Business, and a number of our products worldwide, which may also require the expenditure of regulatory product registration costs. Rebranding efforts may not be complete before the agreement with Planmeca allowing us to use the \u201cKavo\u201d brand expires, potentially causing substantial inventory write-offs. We cannot be certain that our customers will be receptive to our proposed rebranding. A failure in our rebranding efforts may affect our ability to attract and retain customers following the Divestiture, resulting in reduced revenues.\nIf we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\nMany of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. The laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties\u2019 intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. If we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may not be able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nDefects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services (including software), or allegations thereof, could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nManufacturing or design defects or \u201cbugs\u201d in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, \u201coff label\u201d use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage, loss of profits or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.\nFor a discussion of risks pertaining to the dental amalgam sold by us, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulatory Matters-Medical Device Regulations.\u201d\nOur restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\nWe are currently implementing significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. Further, these activities may cause employees or third parties to raise claims against us, potentially resulting in additional costs and/or causing delays in implementation. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Moreover, we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities. Realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, may take several years, and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.\nWe may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), shifts in market trends (such as customers putting an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably made) and other adverse effects. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our corporate headquarters are located in California, which has historically experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. The effects of climate change could also impair the availability and cost of certain products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require.\nIn addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions, alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives. If legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the United States or in any other jurisdictions in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in the costs associated with, sourcing, manufacturing and distributing our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any such regulatory changes could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions, including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and comply with other regulatory requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion, and in the future we may incur additional indebtedness. This indebtedness could adversely affect our businesses and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs of February 15, 2022, we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion, including approximately $0.9 billion under our Amended Credit Agreement, $518 million under our Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), and had an additional $750 million of borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, with the ability to request further increases to the revolving credit facility up to $350 million.\nPlease refer to Note 16 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Annual Report. This debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our security holders, including:\n\u25e6increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25e6limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u25e6requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u25e6limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and industries;\n\u25e6diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and\n\u25e6placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase in the future. The Amended Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term interest, including for example EBITDA-based leverage and interest coverage ratios. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.\nThe risks described above will increase with the amount of indebtedness we incur, and in the future we may incur significant indebtedness in addition to the indebtedness described above.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful and may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy (if we pay dividends), seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The instruments that may govern our indebtedness in the future may restrict our ability to dispose of assets and may restrict the use of proceeds from those dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including certain international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make adequate distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal, tax and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nHolders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes between us and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, dated as of May 21, 2020 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d). A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering only shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share) and one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. As of December 31, 2021, one of the conditions allowing the Note holders to convert the Notes was satisfied. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, the Notes are classified as a current liability. The conversion conditions are tested quarterly.\nThe capped call transactions we entered into in connection with the Notes may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the \u201cCapped Calls\u201d) with the initial purchasers of the Notes, their respective affiliates and other financial institutions (the \u201coption counterparties\u201d). The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nIn connection with establishing their hedges of the Capped Calls, the option counterparties or their affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These parties may modify their hedge positions in the future by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Calls.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Calls with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate volatility, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly, and we may be adversely affected by recent proposals to reform LIBOR.\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities, including our Amended Credit Agreement, are made at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate volatility. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nIn addition, certain of our financial arrangements, including our Amended Credit Agreement, bear interest rates that fluctuate with changes in short-term prevailing interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. However, on November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), indicated that it would consult on its intention to cease publication of most USD LIBOR tenors beyond June 30, 2023. On March 5, 2021, the IBA announced that it will cease the publication of one week and two-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR and all non-USD (GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY) LIBOR settings at the end of December 2021, but will extend the publication of the remaining U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings (overnight and one, three, six and 12 month U.S. Dollar LIBOR) until the end of June 2023. U.S. bank regulators have advised banks to cease writing, subject to certain limited exceptions, new U.S. Dollar LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021 and the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARCC\u201d) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for USD LIBOR. The extended cessation date for most USD LIBOR tenors will allow for more time for existing legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature and provide additional time to continue to prepare for the transition from LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as SOFR, or any other reference rate, will have on the Company\u2019s financial arrangements.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:\n\u25e6Governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.\n\u25e6Certain of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. The Health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. Other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.\nThese changes, as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have started changing the way health care is delivered, reimbursed and funded and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.\nOur businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition.\u201d In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including emerging markets. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that our competitors or our customers may introduce private label, generic, or low-cost products that compete with our products at lower price points. If these competitors\u2019 products capture significant market share or decrease market prices overall, this could have an adverse effect on our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nChanges in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.\nWe compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs and privacy. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities have imposed, and may continue to impose, protocols and restrictions intended to contain the spread of the virus, including limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, quarantines, lockdowns and travel restrictions. Such restrictions have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business operations and reduce demand for our products or services.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements.\nMost of our products are medical devices subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The FDA and these other regulatory authorities enforce additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices. The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. For example, the EU MDR imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices had until May 2021 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR. Complying with the EU MDR required modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions, and required and will continue to require updates to technical files, among other changes. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\nTo varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise, we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product\u2019s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product\u2019s market acceptance. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities and real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) have led to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, and can lead to warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, mandatory recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in \u201cItem 1. Business -Regulatory Matters.\u201d Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that government authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.\nNoncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, criminal prosecutions and other adverse effects referenced below under \u201cOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.\u201d Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nOff-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.\nThe FDA and, in some cases, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we could be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, substantial monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and/or the curtailment of our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nCertain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.\nOnce a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the U.S. pursuant to a 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device. Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nOur operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nOur operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and impose end-of-life disposal and take-back programs. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.\nIn addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to Note 15 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.\nIn addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels.\nWe are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.\nOur products and operations are also often subject to differing national industrial standards, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. Non-compliance with applicable requirements (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) could result in import detentions, fines, damages, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, loss of customers, significant legal and investigatory fees, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could lead to securities litigation brought against us or cause investors to lose the value of their investment.\nWe have a limited trading history and there may be wide fluctuations in the market value of our common stock as a result of many factors. From our IPO through February 16, 2022, the sales price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE has ranged from a low sales price of $10.08 on March 19, 2020 to a high sales price of $49.92 on February 16, 2022. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, some of which may be beyond our control, include:\n\u25e6our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u25e6actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25e6changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u25e6the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u25e6changes to the regulatory and legal environment in which we operate;\n\u25e6market and business conditions related to COVID-19;\n\u25e6overall market fluctuations and domestic and worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u25e6other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility recently that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities have often been followed by securities litigation brought against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, as a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the purchase price.\nCertain provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our second amended and restated bylaws, the Indenture governing the Notes, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by our board of directors. These provisions include, among others:\n\u25e6the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u25e6the inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u25e6rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u25e6the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u25e6the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, subject to a phased-in declassification whereby Class III directors will be elected to a one-year term at the 2022 annual meeting, Class I directors will be elected to a one-year term at the 2023 annual meeting and Class II directors will be elected to a one-year term at the 2024 annual meeting such that effective as of the 2024 annual meeting, our board of directors will be fully declassified, and until the full declassification of the Board as of the date of the 2024 annual meeting, this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;\n\u25e6prior to our board of directors being fully declassified, stockholders may only remove directors with cause; and\n\u25e6the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies (including those resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors) on our board of directors.\nAdditionally, certain provisions in the Notes and the Indenture governing the Notes could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of our securities may view as favorable.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation (an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d) shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (iii) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and stockholders.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless our board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nIn addition, our second amended and restated bylaws, as amended, provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and stockholders.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the prices of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance our operations or fund acquisitions, or for other purposes. In addition, we have reserved 20,656,197 shares of common stock for the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units. The Indenture for the Notes does not restrict our ability to issue additional equity securities in the future. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock, and, accordingly, the Notes may significantly decline. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders, including holders of Notes who have received shares of our common stock upon conversion of their Notes.\nGeneral Risks\nInternational economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.\nIn 2021, 51% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the emerging markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in emerging markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:\n\u25e6interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;\n\u25e6differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;\n\u25e6local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u25e6changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;\n\u25e6trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;\n\u25e6unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;\n\u25e6capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u25e6the potential for nationalization of enterprises;\n\u25e6changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u25e6limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;\n\u25e6difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u25e6differing labor regulations;\n\u25e6difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis;\n\u25e6differing protection of intellectual property;\n\u25e6greater uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals; and\n\u25e6other factors beyond our control, such has terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics, including fluctuations in the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions on business activity which may vary significantly by region.\nAny of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements, business, growth rate, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor example, we generate approximately 10% of our annual sales from Greater China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely influenced by evolving political, economic and social conditions in China generally. Additionally, China\u2019s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies, and it maintains control over China\u2019s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. Further, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world\u2019s leading economies, including the United States and China. Any uncertainty or adverse changes to economic conditions in China or the policies of China\u2019s government or its laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China and could impact our business and operating results, leading to a reduction in demand for our products and adversely affecting our financial statements, business, growth rate, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), war, terrorism, widespread protests and civil unrest, or other natural or man-made disasters. For example, our corporate headquarters and many of our operations, including certain of our manufacturing facilities, are located in California, which is prone to earthquakes and wildfires, in addition to the other risks discussed above. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $4.2 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nForeign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.\nSales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and, given our global operations, may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business\u2019 functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. We also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nThe U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe are or could be subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously-owned or subsequently-purchased entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory or judicial subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. We may also become involved in lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, businesses acquired or divested by us or our predecessors. The types of claims made in lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, incidental damages, consequential damages, and punitive damages (and in some types of cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The pursuit or defense of these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention, we may incur significant expenses in pursuing or defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business.\nWork stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.\nCertain of our U.S. and non-U.S. employees are subject to collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business, including our productivity and reputation.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related stockholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.", "PERMNO": 18910, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "NVST"}
