{"cik": "896747", "company": "AMERICAN BIO MEDICA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk FACTORS\nABMC has a history of incurring net losses.\nSince our inception and throughout most of our history, we have incurred net losses, including but not limited to, a net loss of $490,000 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect to continue to make substantial expenditures for sales and marketing, product development and other business purposes. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to increase sales of our products (and our cessation of selling and marketing our oral fluid test in the Workplace market in November 2013 severely impacted our ability to increase sales in the year ended December 31, 2014), reduce production and other costs and successfully introduce new products and enhanced versions of our existing products into in the marketplace. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues at a rate that equals or exceeds expenditures. In the year ended December 31, 2014, sales continued to be negatively impacted by the aftermath of the recession. Our failure to increase sales while maintaining or reducing product costs, general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development costs would result in the Company incurring additional losses.\nABMC believes it will need additional funding for its existing and future operations.\nOur financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. If global economic conditions do not improve or return to pre-recession levels, our current cash balances and cash generated from future operations may not be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months. Future events, including the expenses and difficulties which may be encountered in establishing and maintaining a substantial market for our products (including but not limited to the cessation of marketing and selling of our oral fluid test in the Workplace market), could make cash on hand insufficient to fund operations. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or that we will be able to complete financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any such equity financing would result in further dilution to existing shareholders.\nThe POCT market for DOA is highly competitive.\nThe POCT market for DOA is highly competitive. Several companies produce drug tests that compete directly with our DOA product line, including Alere (formerly Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc.) and its subsidiaries, as well as OraSure Technologies, Inc. In addition to these manufacturers, there are a number of smaller privately held companies, as well as foreign manufacturers, that compete with us. Some of our competitors are more well known, and some have far greater financial resources than us, which means they can devote substantially more resources to business and product development and marketing efforts. Our inability to successfully address any competitive risk factors could negatively impact sales and further our profitability.\nOne of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOne of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in the year ended December 31, 2014. Although we have entered into a written purchase agreement with this customer, this customer does not has any minimum purchase obligations and could stop buying products from us with 90-days\u2019 notice. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from this customer or the loss of this customer could reduce our revenues. There can be no assurance that this customer or any of our current customers will continue to place orders, that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers.\nWe rely on third parties for raw materials used in our DOA products and in our bulk test strip contract manufacturing processes.\nWe currently have approximately 51 suppliers that provide us with the raw materials necessary to manufacture our point of collection drug-testing strips and our point of collection tests for DOA. For most of our raw materials, we have multiple suppliers, but there are a few raw materials for which we only have one supplier. The loss of one or more of these suppliers, the non-performance of one or more of their materials or the lack of availability of raw materials could suspend our manufacturing process related to our DOA products. This interruption of the manufacturing process could impair our ability to fill customers\u2019 orders as they are placed, putting us at a competitive disadvantage.\nFurthermore, we rely on a number of third parties for the supply of raw materials necessary to manufacture the test components we supply to other diagnostic companies under bulk test strip contract manufacturing agreements. For most of these raw materials, we have multiple suppliers, but there are a few raw materials for which we only have one supplier. The loss of one or more of these suppliers could suspend the bulk test strip manufacturing process and this interruption could impair our ability to perform bulk test strip contract manufacturing services.\nWe have a significant amount of raw material and \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory on hand that may not be used in the year ended December 31, 2014 if the expected configuration of sales orders is not received at projected levels.\nWe had approximately $1,136,000 in raw material components for the manufacture of our products at December 31, 2014. The non-chemical raw material components may be retained and used in production indefinitely and the chemical raw materials components have lives in excess of 20 years. In addition to the raw material inventory, we had approximately $390,000 in manufactured testing strips, or other \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory at December 31, 2014. The components for much of this \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory have lives of 12-24 months. If sales orders received are not for products that would utilize the raw material components, or if product developments make the raw materials obsolete, we may be required to dispose of these unused raw materials. In addition, since the components for much of the \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory have lives of 12-24 months, if sales orders within the next 12-24 months are not for products that contain the components of the \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory, we may need to discard this expired \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory. We have established an allowance for obsolete or slow moving inventory. At December 31, 2014, this allowance was $324,000. There can be no assurance that this allowance will continue to be adequate for the year ending December 31, 2015 and/or that it will not have to be adjusted in the future.\nPossible inability to hire and retain qualified personnel.\nWe will need additional skilled sales and marketing, technical and production personnel to grow the business. If we fail to retain our present staff or hire additional qualified personnel our business could suffer.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively.\nWe are dependent on the expertise and experience of our senior management for our future success. The loss of a member of senior management could negatively impact our business and results of operations. On October 30, 2013, Melissa A. Waterhouse, our (former) Executive Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary was appointed as our interim Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer when we became aware that our (then current) Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer Stan Cipkowski was unable to continue due for medical reasons (Mr. Cipkowski subsequently passed away on October 31, 2013). Ms. Waterhouse was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer on June 20, 2014. We have an employment agreement in place with Ms. Waterhouse, but there can be no assurance that Ms. Waterhouse will continue her employment; and the loss of Ms. Waterhouse could disrupt the business and therefore have a negative impact on business results. We also have a number of other individuals in senior management positions. There can be no assurance that they too will continue their employment. We did maintain key man insurance for Cipkowski and the Company was the sole beneficiary of the policy with a face amount of $500,000. We do not currently maintain key man insurance on Ms. Waterhouse.\nAny adverse changes in our regulatory framework could negatively impact our business.\nIn the past, our industry believed that when DOA POCTs were sold in non-clinical markets (such as workplace), they did not fall under the definition of a \u201cmedical device\u201d, but when sold in the clinical market, they did fall under the definition of a \u201cmedical device.\u201d When a product is a medical device, a 510(k) marketing application must be submitted to the FDA. A 510(k) is a premarketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently on the U.S. market and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. A legally marketed device is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), or a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent to such a device through the 510(k) process, or one established through Evaluation of Automatic Class III Definition. The legally marketed device(s) to which equivalence is drawn is known as the \u201cpredicate\u201d device(s). Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish that a device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device.\nOur urine point of collection products have received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA, and have therefore met FDA requirements for professional use. We have also been granted a CLIA waiver from the FDA related to our Rapid TOX (urine) product line.\nOur oral fluid products have never been marketed or sold to any market that would use the products for diagnosis or treatment and prior to the receipt of a warning letter from FDA in July 2009, it was our belief, and the belief of our industry, that 510(k) marketing clearance was not required to sell in non-clinical markets, so we did not seek 510(k) marketing clearance from FDA. After protracted discussions with FDA, we entered into a Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction (the \u201cConsent Decree\u201d) with FDA, and on September 3, 2013, we filed our application for 510(k) marketing clearance. In November 2013, we were informed that the FDA determined that our OralStat was not substantially equivalent to the predicate market device (even though OralStat had an overall accuracy rate of 92%). In accordance with our Consent Decree, we ceased marketing and selling OralStat to the workplace (non-forensic) market but we continue to market and sell OralStat to the forensic market and for export outside the United States.\nThe cost of filing our application for 510(k) clearance was material and had a negative impact on our efforts to improve our financial performance. Our point of collection oral fluid drug tests historically account for a material portion of its sales (approximately 15%-20% on an annual basis). The majority of these were sales to the Workplace market. The inability to market and sell our point of collection oral fluid drug tests in the Workplace market negatively impacted our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014, and the loss of oral fluid customers has negatively impacted our revenues. ABMC intends to continue marketing and selling OralStat to forensic markets and to markets outside of the United States.\nAlthough we currently unaware of any additional changes in regulatory standards related to any of our markets, if regulatory standards were to further change in the future, there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant the Company appropriate marketing clearances required to comply with the changes, if and when we apply for them.\nWe rely on intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to obtain patent or other protection for our technology, products or services.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, products and services. We also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, product enhancements and name recognition are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. Our personnel are bound by non-disclosure agreements. However, in some instances, some courts have not enforced all aspects of such agreements.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary products under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection. We currently have a total of 29 patents related to our POCT products. We have additional patent applications pending in the United States, and other countries, related to our POCT products. Certain trademarks have been registered in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance that the additional patents and/or trademarks will be granted or that, if granted, they will withstand challenge.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain information that we regard as proprietary. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property rights in the future. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not ensure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate. Policing and enforcement against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could entail significant expenses and could prove difficult or impossible.\nPotential issuance and exercise of new options and warrants and exercise of outstanding options and warrants, along with the conversion of outstanding convertible debentures could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nWe currently have three non-statutory stock option plans, the Fiscal 2000 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan (the \u201c2000 Plan\u201d), the Fiscal 2001 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Equity Compensation Plan (the \u201c2013 Plan\u201d). All three plans has been adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by our shareholders. Only the 2001 Plan has options issued. Only the 2001 Plan and the 2013 Plan have options available for future issuance. As of December 31, 2014, there were 1,295,000 options issued and outstanding under the 2001 Plan. There were no options issued under the 2013 Plan, making the total issued and outstanding options $1,295,000 as of December 31, 2014. Of the total options issued and outstanding, 946,000 are fully vested as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, there were 2,422,000 options available for issuance under the 2001 Plan and 4,000,000 options available for issuance under the 2013 Plan.\nSeries A Debentures. In August 2008, we completed an offering of 10% Series A Debentures (\u201cSeries A Debentures\u201d) and received gross proceeds of $750,000.\nThe Series A Debentures were set to mature on August 1, 2012; however, in July 2012, the term of $645,000 in Series A Debentures was extended to reflect a due date of August 1, 2013, and the interest rate during the extension period was increased from 10% to 15% per annum, due quarterly in arrears. All other terms of the Series A Debentures remained unchanged. Thirty-two of the thirty-seven Holders of Series A Debentures (representing $645,000 of Series A Debentures) extended. Five of the Holders of Series A Debentures (representing $105,000 in Series A Debentures) did not wish to extend the Series A Debentures (we used a portion of the proceeds from a $150,000 Bridge Loan with Cantone Asset Management (\u201cCAM\u201d) to pay the five Holders that did not wish to amend/extend). Given that five of the Holders did not extend, and the principal paid, the number of potential Debenture Conversation Shares did decrease from just over 1 million shares to approximately 860,000 shares.\nCantone Research, Inc. (CRI) acted as our exclusive placement agent in connection with the July 2012 amendment of the Series A Debentures, and as compensation for their placement agent services, among other things, the Placement Agent Warrants issued to CRI (in connection with their services as placement agent in the original Series A Debenture financing) were amended to reflect a purchase price of $0.17 per share and a new term of three (3) years or they are exercisable through July 31, 2015.\nOn August 1, 2012, we issued Cantone Asset Management, Inc. (CAM) warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.16 per share (the \u201cCAM Warrant\u201d) in connection with a Consulting Agreement with CAM.\nOn October 7, 2013, we entered into a new Placement Agent Agreement (\u201c2013 Agent Agreement\u201d) with CRI related to the further extension of the Series A Debentures, as amended, due August 1, 2013. Under the amendment, the term of the Series A Debentures was extended to reflect a due date of either February 1, 2014 or August 1, 2014, at the election of the Series A Debenture Holder. The interest rate during the extension period remained 15% per annum, due quarterly in arrears. All other terms of the Series A Debentures remained the same.\nAs compensation for their placement agent services, CRI received a 3-year warrant to purchase 75,000 common shares at an exercise price of $0.14. On October 7, 2013, we entered into a new $200,000 Bridge Loan (the \u201c2013 Bridge Loan\u201d) with CAM to pay off the existing Bridge Loan with CAM and to pay placement agent fees and expenses. As part of the inducement to enter into the 2013 Bridge Loan, we issued CAM a 3-year warrant to purchase 250,000 common shares at an exercise price of $0.14. The warrants were 100% exercisable on the date of the grant. On October 7, 2013, we entered into another Agreement to the Series A Debenture (the \u201c2013 Series A Debenture Amendment\u201d) with thirty of the thirty-two holders of Series A Debentures (the \u201cDebenture Holders\u201d). An extension period of either 6 or 12 months was at the election of the Debenture Holder. 27 of the Debenture Holders elected to extend for a period of 12 months and 3 elected to extend for a period of 6 months. The 27 Holders that elected to extend for a 12-month period were each issued a warrant to purchase 1 share of common stock for each $1.00 that was extended. We issued 2-year warrants to purchase 543,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.14 (the \u201c2013 Holder Warrants\u201d).\nImperium/Monarch Warrants\nOn January 16, 2013, in connection with a line of credit with Imperium Commercial Finance LLC (\u201cImperium\u201d), we granted Imperium a 7-year warrant to purchase 2,000,000 common shares of the Company at an exercise price of $0.18, (the \u201cImperium Warrant\u201d). The Imperium Warrant was 100% exercisable on the date of issuance. In addition, as their finder\u2019s fee compensation, we issued Monarch Capital Group, LLC (\u201cMonarch\u201d) a 5-year warrant representing 3% (60,000 common shares) of the Imperium Warrant, also at a strike price of $0.18, (the \u201cMonarch Warrant\u201d). The Monarch Warrant was 100% exercisable on the date of issuance.\nIf these stock options, Placement Agent Warrants, CAM Warrants, 2013 Holder Warrants, Imperium Warrant or Monarch Warrant are exercised, the common shares issued will be freely tradable, increasing the total number of common shares issued and outstanding. If these shares are offered for sale in the public market, the sales could adversely affect the prevailing market price by lowering the bid price of our securities. The exercise of any of these stock options, Placement Agent Warrants, CAM Warrants, 2013 Holder Warrants, the Imperium Warrant and the Monarch Warrant could also materially impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of equity securities because issuance of the common shares underlying the stock options, Placement Agent Warrants, CAM Warrants, 2013 Holder Warrants, Imperium Warrant and the Monarch Warrant would cause further dilution of our securities. In addition, in the event of any change in the outstanding shares of our common stock by reason of any recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, merger or any other changes in our corporate or capital structure or our common shares, the number and class of shares covered by the stock options and/or the exercise price of the stock options may be adjusted as set forth in their plans.\nSubstantial resale of restricted securities may depress the market price of our securities.\nThere are 3,404,000 common shares presently issued and outstanding as of the date hereof that are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and in the future may be sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Rule 144 addresses sales of restricted securities by affiliates and non-affiliates of an issuer. An \u201caffiliate\u201d is a person, such as an officer, director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer. \u201cControl\u201d means the power to direct the management and policies of the company in question, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. If someone buys securities from a controlling person or an affiliate, they take restricted securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's hands.\nA person who is not an affiliate of the issuer (and who has not been for at least three months) and has held the restricted securities for at least one year can sell the securities without regard to restrictions. If the non-affiliate had held the securities for at least six months but less than one year, the securities may be sold by the non-affiliate as long as the current public information condition has been met (i.e. that the issuer has complied with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)).\nWe are subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Under Rule 144, if a holder of securities is an affiliate of an issuer subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, the securities must be held for at least six months. In addition, the number of equity securities sold during any three-month period cannot exceed 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold. The securities must be sold in unsolicited, routine trading transactions and brokers may not receive more than normal commission. Affiliates must also file a notice with the SEC on Form 144 if a sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period. The sale must take place within three months of filing the Form 144 and, if the securities have not been sold, an amended notice must be filed. Investors should be aware that sales under Rule 144 or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act may depress the market price of our securities in any market for such shares.\nOur securities are currently trading on the OTC Markets, Inc. (under their OTCQB\u2122 market tier), and may be subject to SEC \u201cpenny stock,\u201d rules, which could make it more difficult for a broker-dealer to trade our common shares, for an investor to acquire or dispose of our common shares in the secondary market and for us to retain or attract market makers.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange or securities of an issuer in continuous operation for more than three years whose net tangible assets are in excess of $2 million, or an issuer that has average revenue of at least $6 million for the last three years. Our common shares are currently trading on the OTC Markets, Inc., under their OTCQB market tier (the US registered and reporting marketplace for over-the-counter (OTC) securities). As of the year ended December 31, 2014, our net tangible assets did not exceed $2 million, however, our average revenue for the last three years exceeded $6 million, so our securities currently qualify for exclusion from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definitions. However, if our three-year average revenue falls below $6 million, we would fail to qualify for the exclusion, and our common shares would be subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. For these reasons, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Therefore, broker-dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our securities because of the penny stock disclosure rules. Not maintaining a listing on a major stock market may result in a decrease in the trading price of our securities due to a decrease in liquidity and less interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our securities, and could also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future. Furthermore, listing on the OTCQB may make it more difficult to retain and attract market makers. In the event that market makers cease to function as such, public trading of our securities will be adversely affected or may cease entirely.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of our required compliance with certain regulations implemented by the SEC. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations result in significant legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nMore specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Our management is required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which requiring auditor\u2019s attestation related to internal controls over financial reporting). Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. As a result, our compliance with Section 404(a) may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to ensure compliance with these regulations and/or to correct such material weaknesses. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404(a), or if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, the market price of our common shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nDifficult conditions in the global economy have adversely affected our business and results of operations and it is uncertain if these conditions will improve in the near future.\nThe global economy has faced an extended worldwide recession and economic crisis. The recession and economic crisis has substantially reduced our sales and negatively impacted our results of operations. The magnitude and duration of the recession and economic crisis make it extremely difficult to forecast future sales levels. Without an economic recovery, we could experience lower sales, lower gross margins and increased bad debt risks, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There could be a number of other adverse effects on our business, including insolvency of customers and suppliers.\nInability to comply with financial covenants under our current credit facilities could result in our creditor(s) declaring all amounts owed to them due and payable with immediate effect, or result in the collection of collateral by the creditor(s); both of which would have an adverse material impact on our business and our ability to continue operations.\nWe have a credit facility with Imperium Commercial Finance, LLC (the \u201cImperium Line of Credit\u201d) consisting of revolving line of credit. The Imperium Line of Credit is secured by a first security interest in all of our receivables, inventory, and intellectual property rights along with a second security interest in our machinery and equipment (together the \u201cCollateral\u201d).\nWe also have a Mortgage Consolidation Loan with First Niagara Bank (\u201cFNB\u201d). The loan with FNB is secured by our facility in Kinderhook, New York as well as various pieces of machinery and equipment.\nBoth of these facilities require that we comply with certain financial covenants (these covenants are discussed in more detail in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and in the Notes within this Annual Reports on Form 10-K). We have not been in compliance with the EBITDA requirements under the Imperium Line of Credit since the First Quarter of 2013. We did receive a waiver from Imperium for the three months ended March 31, 2013 (for which we paid them a fee of $10,000), but no further formal waivers have been issued. This non-compliance constitutes an event of default, and the interest rate on the Imperium Line of Credit can be increased by 4% for as long as the event of default occurs. Imperium\u2019s other remedies include, but are not limited to, termination or suspension of Imperium\u2019s obligation to make further advances to the Company, and declaration of all amounts owed to Imperium due and payable. The increase in interest rate, given our current advances under the Imperium Line of Credit would not be material, however, if Imperium were to suspend or terminate further advances, or declare all amounts due and payable, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and negatively impact our ability to continue operations.\nFNB\u2019s remedies for an event of default include, but are not necessarily limited to, consideration of all amounts owed to them due and payable and collection or receiving of Collateral. If Imperium and/or FNB were to exercise these remedies, it is highly unlikely that we would be able to pay such amounts and this would result in the collection and receipt of the Collateral by the lender, and this would have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to continue operations. Failure to comply with the financial covenants under either one of these facilities would not only result in a default under the particular facility but could be considered an event of default under the other facility.", "PERMNO": 85671, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ABMC"}
