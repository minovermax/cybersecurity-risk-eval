{"cik": "1102993", "company": "LIVEPERSON INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain of the important risk factors that could cause, or contribute to causing, our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated, expected or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that impair our business operations. Prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and other public filings before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations, which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have in the past incurred, and we may in the future incur losses and experience negative cash flows, either or both of which may be significant and may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly. These fluctuations may be as a result of a variety of factors, including the following factors which are in part within our control, and in part outside of our control:\n\u2022\ncontinued adoption by companies doing business online of real-time sales, marketing and customer service solutions;\n\u2022\ncontinued adoption by individual Experts and consumers of online real-time advice services;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing models, policies or the pricing policies of our current and future competitors;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 business success;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 demand for our services;\n\u2022\nconsumer demand for our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain customers;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid and/or manage service interruptions, disruptions, or security incidents; and\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations, including those related to acquisitions.\nOur revenue and results may also fluctuate significantly in the future due to the following factors that are entirely outside of our control:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions specific to the Internet, electronic commerce and online media; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful because of these factors. You should not rely upon these comparisons as indicators of our future performance.\nDue to the foregoing factors, it is possible that our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we are not competitive in the markets for online sales, marketing and customer service solutions, or online consumer services, our business could be harmed.\nThe markets for online engagement technology and online consumer services are intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive marketing, evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments and frequent new product introductions. Established or new entities may enter the market in the near future, including those that provide solutions for real-time interaction online, or online consumer services related to real-time advice.\nWe compete directly with companies focused on technology that facilitates real-time sales, email management, searchable knowledgebase applications and customer service interaction. These markets remain fairly saturated with small companies that compete on price and features. We face significant competition from online interaction solution providers, including SaaS providers such as Talisma, eGain, TouchCommerce and Oracle Corporation. We also face potential competition from web analytics and online engagement service providers, and other enterprise software and SaaS solutions companies such as Adobe, Oracle, Google and SAP. In addition, established technology and/or consumer-oriented companies such as Google, Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Yahoo! may leverage their existing relationships and capabilities to offer online engagement solutions that facilitate real-time assistance. Furthermore, many of our competitors offer a broader range of customer relationship management products and services than we currently offer. We may be disadvantaged and our business may be harmed if companies doing business online choose real-time sales, marketing and customer service solutions from such providers.\nFinally, we compete with customers and potential customers that choose to provide a real-time sales, marketing and customer service solution in-house as well as, to a lesser extent, traditional offline customer service solutions, such as telephone call centers.\nWe believe that competition will increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market. As compared to our company, some of our larger current and potential competitors have:\n\u2022\ngreater brand recognition;\n\u2022\nmore diversified lines of products and services; and\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater financial, marketing and research and development resources.\nAdditionally, some competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and better-financed companies. These competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\nundertake more extensive marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nadopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u2022\nmake more attractive offers to businesses or individuals to induce them to use their products or services.\nAny change in the general market acceptance of the real-time sales, marketing and customer service solution business model or in online, real-time consumer advice services may harm our competitive position. Such changes may allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings, and would also provide time for new competitors to develop real-time sales, marketing, customer service and web analytics applications or competitive consumer service offerings and solicit prospective customers within our target markets. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.\nThe success of our business is dependent on the retention of existing customers and their purchase of additional services, as well as attracting new customers and consumer users to our consumer services.\nOur business services agreements typically have twelve month terms. In some cases, our agreements are terminable or may terminate upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice without penalty. If a significant number of our customers, or any one customer to whom we provide a significant amount of services, were to terminate services, or reduce the amount of services purchased or fail to purchase additional services, our results of operations may be negatively and materially affected. Dissatisfaction with the nature or quality of our services could also lead customers to terminate our service. We depend on monthly fees and interaction-based fees from our services for substantially all of our revenue. As part of our strategy, we are increasingly offering customers subscriptions with interaction-based fees. While this interaction-based fee model has demonstrated success in our business to date, it could potentially produce greater variability in our revenue as revenue in this model is impacted by the number of interactions that our customers generate through use of our products. Because of the historically small amount of services sold in initial orders,\nwe depend significantly on the growth of our customer base and sales to new customers and sales of additional services to our existing customers. Our revenue could decline unless we are able to obtain additional customers or alternate revenue sources.\nNew and developing regulatory or other legal requirements could materially impact our business.\nWe, and our customers, are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that apply to the conduct of business on the Internet such as, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, data privacy, content, internet (or net) neutrality, advertising, electronic contracts, electronic payment, information security and intellectual property rights. We post on our web site our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data, and we observe data security protocols and other business practices in an effort to comply with applicable laws. Expansion and interpretation of user privacy and data security laws and their application to the Internet in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and unsettled. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied differently in any given jurisdiction in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nVarious United States and foreign jurisdictions impose laws regarding the collection, use and retention of data. For instance, some states in the United States have enacted legislation designed to protect consumers\u2019 privacy by prohibiting the distribution of \u201cspyware\u201d over the Internet. Such legislation typically focuses on restricting the proliferation of software that, when installed on an end user\u2019s computer is used to intentionally and deceptively take control of the end user\u2019s machine. We do not believe that the data monitoring methods employed by our technology constitute \u201cspyware\u201d or that our data monitoring methods are prohibited by applicable laws. However, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, many of which can be enforced by government entities or private parties, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant changes in application and interpretation. So, if, for example, the scope of the previously mentioned \u201cspyware\u201d legislation were changed to include web analytics, such legislation could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could potentially restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nDomestic and foreign governments are also considering restricting the collection and use of Internet visitor and user data more generally. For example, some jurisdictions, including the United States, are considering whether the collection of even anonymous data may invade the privacy of web site visitors. If laws or regulations are enacted that limit data collection or use practices related to anonymous data, we and/or our customers may be required to obtain the express consent of web visitors in order for our technology to perform certain of its basic functions that are based on the collection and use of technical data. Requirements that a website must first obtain consent from its web visitors before using our technology could reduce the amount and value of the services we provide to customers, which might impede sales and/or cause some existing customers to discontinue using our services. We could also need to expend considerable effort and resources to develop new product features and/or procedures to comply with any such legal requirements.\nBusinesses using our products may collect data from their web users when those web users contact them with inquiries. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted, and are considering adopting other laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data obtained from consumers that currently affect or may affect our business customers. We use a variety of data security procedures and practices such as encryption and masking algorithms in an effort to protect information when transmitted over the Internet or stored, and encourage our customers to do the same. Changes to applicable laws and or interpretation thereof relating to data security and other consumer protection areas could significantly increase the economic burden to us and our customers of regulatory compliance, and could negatively impact our business. For example, European Union members have rules and regulations regarding the collection and use of data that are far more stringent, and impose more substantial burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the United States. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere often can be uncertain, in conflict or in a state of flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices, in which case we could be subject to possible fines or an order requiring that we change our data practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our commercial interests.\nA range of other proposed or existing laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example:\nExisting and proposed laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and monitoring of online behavioral data such as the proposed \u201cDo Not Track\u201d regulations and plans by the Obama administration to offer a sweeping online privacy bill to Congress in the first quarter of 2015 could potentially apply to some of our current or planned products and services. The FTC has also ratcheted up its enforcement actions against companies that fail to live up to their privacy or data security commitments to consumers. Currently there are many proposals by lawmakers and industry in this area, both in the United States and overseas, which address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, and establish data security and breach notification requirements. Given that this is an evolving and unsettled area of regulation, the imposition of any new significant restrictions or technological requirements could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for third-party content delivered through our website and products. In the United States, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested and could change. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. While providers of online services currently are generally not held liable for activities of their third party users, changes in applicable laws or new judicial interpretations imposing liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.\nThe Child Online Protection Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, respectively, restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect or use certain categories of information from children under 13.\nIn January 2004, the United States Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, became effective. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the transmission and content of commercial emails and, among other things, obligates the sender of such emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt-out of receiving future emails from the sender, and establishes penalties for the transmission of email messages which are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Many state legislatures also have adopted laws that impact the delivery of commercial email, and laws that regulate commercial email practices have been enacted in some of the international jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, Internet service providers and licensors of software products have introduced a variety of systems and products to filter out certain types of commercial email, without any common protocol to determine whether the recipient desired to receive the email being blocked. As a result, it is difficult for us to determine in advance whether or not emails generated by our customers using our solutions will be permitted by spam filters to reach the intended recipients.\nBoth existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and reputation, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines or requirements that we modify or cease our business practices.\nAdditionally, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even if we don\u2019t have a local entity, employees or infrastructure. Often, foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States. The Company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments.\nWe are exposed to currency rate fluctuations and our results of operations may be affected as a result.\nAlthough the functional currency of our Israeli subsidiaries is the United States dollar, as a result of the size and scope of our Israeli operations, our currency rate fluctuation risk associated with the exchange rate movement of the United States dollar against the New Israeli Shekel has increased. In addition, the functional currency of our operations in the U.K. is the Pound Sterling; the functional currency of our operations in Netherlands and Germany is the Euro; the functional currency of our operations in Australia is the Australian dollar; and the functional currency of our operations in Japan is the Japanese Yen. Conducting business in currencies other than the United States dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar relative to other foreign currencies affect our revenue, cost of revenue and operating expenses, and result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses. In 2014, we did not take part in any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations for our international operations. We may seek to enter into hedging transaction in the future, but we may be unable to enter into those transactions successfully, on acceptable terms or at all. We cannot predict whether or not we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future. To the extent the international component of our revenues grows, our results of operations will become more sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe could face additional regulatory requirements, tax liabilities, currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks as we expand internationally and/or as we expand into direct-to-consumer services.\nIn 2014, we opened up an office in Italy and in 2013 we opened up offices in Germany, Japan and the Netherlands. In November 2014, we acquired \u201cCAO!\u201d a software company with a cloud-based platform that instantly connects consumers with businesses through instant messaging, text messaging, chat, social media and video over the internet for consumer-to-business sales conversions. In 2014, we also acquired Synchronite LLC, a German based start-up that provides co-browsing technology and NexGraph, LLC, a company focused on analytic solutions. In November 2012, we acquired Engage Pty Ltd. an Australian provider of cloud-based customer contact solutions. In May 2012, we acquired certain assets of Amadesa, Ltd., an Israeli-based website analytics company. In addition, we have established a sales, marketing and customer support presence in the United Kingdom in support of expansion efforts into Western Europe, and have integrated the United Kingdom operations of Proficient Systems into that office. There are risks related to doing business in international markets as well as in the online consumer market, such as changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, more stringent rules relating to the data privacy and security, and adverse tax consequences. In addition, there are likely to be different consumer preferences and requirements in specific international markets. Furthermore, we may face difficulties in staffing and managing any foreign operations. One or more of these factors could harm any future international operations.\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a charge to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. In December 2008, we recorded a $23.5 million impairment charge in connection with the Kasamba Inc. acquisition in October 2007. From time to time, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which may negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing customer preferences in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or online consumer services industries and this may harm our business.\nIf we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales, marketing, customer service and/or e-commerce industry or our customers\u2019 or Internet users\u2019 requirements or preferences, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Business on the Internet is characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the market for online sales, marketing, customer service and expert advice solutions is relatively new. Sudden changes in customer and Internet user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, such as broadband communications, and the emergence of new industry and regulatory standards and practices such as but not limited to data privacy and security standards could render the LivePerson services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. The rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022\nenhance the features and performance of our services;\n\u2022\ndevelop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online as well as Internet users; and\n\u2022\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nIf any of our new services, including upgrades to our current services, do not meet our customers\u2019 or Internet users\u2019 expectations, our business may be harmed. Updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf new services require us to grow rapidly, this could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow, our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDownturns in the global economic environment or in particular industries in which our sales are concentrated may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and other global economies have experienced in the past and could in the future experience economic downturn that affects all sectors of the economy, particularly in the financial services and retail industries, resulting in declines in economic growth and consumer confidence, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Global credit and financial markets recently experienced extreme disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and\nrapid fluctuations in market valuations. Our business has been affected by these conditions in the past and could be similarly impacted in the future by any downturn in global economic conditions.\nOur business is, and will continue to be, dependent on sales to customers in the telecommunications, financial services, retail, automotive, real estate and technology industries. A downturn in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event that industry conditions deteriorate in one or more of these industries, we could experience, among other things, cancellation or non-renewal of existing contracts, reduced demand for our products and reduced sales. It could be difficult to predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, either relating to the global economic environment or to the particular industries in which our sales are concentrated, which, in turn, could make it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions and identify risks that may adversely affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeak economic conditions may also cause our customers to experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans. Our customers may reduce their spending on our services, may not be able to discharge their payment and other obligations to us, may experience difficulty raising capital, or may elect to scale back the resources they devote to customer service and/or sales and marketing technology, including services such as ours. Economic conditions may also lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to decrease or delay their purchases of our products and services. If economic conditions deteriorate for us or our customers, we could be required to record charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets, may not be able to collect receivables on a timely basis, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is significantly dependent on our ability to retain our current key personnel, to attract new personnel, and to manage staff attrition.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management team. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that we would be able to successfully recruit and integrate newly-hired senior managers who would work together successfully with our existing management team.\nWe may be unable to attract, integrate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future. If our retention efforts are ineffective, employee turnover could increase and our ability to provide services to our customers would be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates may require in order to join our company.\nAny staff attrition we experience, whether initiated by the departing employees or by us, could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, financial and other resources. To the extent that we do not initiate or seek any staff attrition that occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and hire adequate replacement staff promptly, if at all, and even that if such staff is replaced, we will be successful in integrating these employees. In addition, we may not be able to outsource certain functions. We expect to evaluate our needs and the performance of our staff on a periodic basis, and may choose to make adjustments in the future. If the size of our staff is significantly reduced, either by our choice or otherwise, it may become more difficult for us to manage existing, or establish new, relationships with customers and other counter-parties, or to expand and improve our service offerings. It may also become more difficult for us to implement changes to our business plan or to respond promptly to opportunities in the marketplace. Further, it may become more difficult for us to devote personnel resources necessary to maintain or improve existing systems, including our financial and managerial controls, billing systems, reporting systems and procedures. Thus, any significant amount of staff attrition could cause our business and financial results to suffer.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the past decade, we have completed acquisitions outside the United States. We have also continued to invest in expansion of operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries in Europe, Israel, Japan, Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region. Our ability to continue our international expansion involves various risks, including the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future, or ever, and the difficulty of competing in markets with which we are unfamiliar.\nOur international operations may also fail due to other risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\nvaried, unfamiliar and unclear legal and regulatory restrictions, including different legal and regulatory standards applicable to Internet services, communications, privacy, and data protection;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering intellectual property laws that may not provide sufficient protection for our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in addressing country-specific business requirements and regulations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nstrains on financial and other systems to properly administer VAT and other taxes; and\n\u2022\nlegal, compliance, political or systemic restrictions on the ability of United States companies to do business in foreign countries.\nOur current and any future international expansion plans will require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. We may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to continue expand internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf we do not successfully integrate past or potential future acquisitions, our business could adversely impacted.\nWe have made several acquisitions during the past decade, including three in 2014 and three in 2012. In November 2014, we acquired \u201cCAO!\u201d, a software company with a cloud-based platform that instantly connects consumers with businesses through instant messaging, text messaging, chat, social media and video over the internet for consumer-to-business sales conversions. In June 2014, we acquired Synchronite LLC, a German based start-up that provides co-browsing technology. In March 2014, we acquired NexGraph, LLC, a company focused on analytic solutions. In November 2012, we acquired Engage, Pty Ltd, an Australia-based provider of hosted voice solutions and reseller of LivePerson online engagement solutions. In June 2012, we acquired LookIO, Inc., a United States provider of mobile chat technology. In May 2012, we acquired certain assets of Amadesa, Ltd., an Israeli-based website analytics company. In the future, we may acquire or invest in complementary companies, products or technologies. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to us, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, products and personnel with LivePerson;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from efforts related to the LivePerson services or other pre-existing operations;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering new markets beyond providing real-time sales, marketing and customer service solutions for companies doing business online;\n\u2022\npotential loss of either our existing key employees or key employees of any companies we acquire; and\n\u2022\nour inability to generate sufficient revenue following an acquisition to offset acquisition or investment costs.\nThese difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, expose us to unexpected costs, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nFailures or security breaches in our services or systems, those of our third party providers, or in the websites of our customers, including those resulting from cyber attacks, security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\nWhile we continue to expand our focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our services from cybersecurity threats, computing device capabilities, cyber attacks and other security incidents continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency. This evolution enables more data and processes, such as mobile computing and mobile payments, and it increases the risk that cyber attacks and other security incidents will occur. Our security measures may also be breached due to the intentional acts of outside third parties, employee malfeasance, error, or otherwise, allowing an unauthorized third party to gain access to our data, our users\u2019 data or our customers\u2019 data, including but not limited to individual personal information and financial credit or debit card data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, attack, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems, are constantly evolving in sophisticated ways to avoid detection, it may be difficult for us to anticipate or identify these techniques or to implement adequate security measures in our services and systems to prevent them. A significant cyber attack or other security incident involving our, our service providers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 systems could result in material harm to our brand and reputation, our ability to deliver our services or retain customers, and expose us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and significant damages, fines or penalties.\nIn addition, our customers may authorize third party access to their customer data located in our cloud environment. Because we do not control the transmissions between customer authorized third parties, or the processing of such data by customer authorized third parties, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Because our services are responsible for critical communication between our customers and consumers, any security failures, defects or errors in our components, materials or software or those used by our customers could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and on the end users of their websites. Such adverse impact could include a decrease in demand for our services, damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships, and other financial liability or harm to our business.\nWe may be liable if third parties access or misappropriate confidential or personal data from our systems or services.\nThe dialogue transcripts of the text-based chats and email interactions between our customers and Internet users may include personal data, such as contact and demographic information. Although we employ and continually test and update our security measures to protect this information from unauthorized access, it is still possible that our security measures could be breached and such a breach could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques employed by hackers to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are becoming more sophisticated in circumventing security measures and avoiding detection, we may be unable to anticipate all techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in disclosure of our trade secrets or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee data. If third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate personal data relating to our customers\u2019 Internet users or the text of customer service inquiries, our competitive position may be harmed and we could be subject to liability. In the event of a security incident, we could be liable for compliance with a myriad of breach notification laws at the state, federal and international level, which may cause business disruption and extensive notification costs, and could lead to penalties, government investigations and lawsuits for compliance failures. We may as a result of a security incident be deemed out of compliance with United States federal and state laws, international laws, or contractual commitments, and we may be subject to government investigations, lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, and other costs to respond to breach or security incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate the harm and alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Furthermore, certain software and services that we use to operate our business are hosted and/or operated by third parties or integrated with our systems. If these services were to be interrupted or their security breached, our business operations could be similarly disrupted and we could be exposed to liability and costly investigations or litigation. The need to physically secure and securely transmit and store confidential information online has historically been a significant barrier to e-commerce and online communications and will accelerate as a consumer and regulatory focus and concern. Any publicized compromise of security could deter people from using online services such as the ones we offer or from using them to conduct transactions, which involve transmitting confidential information. Because our success depends on the general acceptance and reputation of our services and electronic commerce, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nWe are dependent on technology systems and third-party content that are beyond our control.\nThe success of our services depends in part on our customers\u2019 online services as well as the Internet connections of visitors to websites, both of which are outside of our control. As a result, it may be difficult to identify the source of problems if they occur. In the past, we have experienced problems related to connectivity which has resulted in slower than normal response times to Internet user chat requests and messages and interruptions in service. Our services rely both on the Internet and on our connectivity vendors for data transmission. Therefore, even when connectivity problems are not caused by our services, our customers or Internet users may attribute the problem to us. This could diminish our brand and harm our business, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts or cause significant customer relations problems.\nIn addition, we rely in part on third-party service providers and other third parties for various services, including, but not limited, to Internet connectivity and network infrastructure hosting, security and maintenance. These providers may experience problems that result in slower than normal response times and/or interruptions in service. If we are unable to continue utilizing the third-party services that support our web hosting and infrastructure or if our services experience interruptions or delays due to third party providers, our reputation and business could be harmed.\nWe also rely on the security of our third party providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. Information technology system failures, including a breach of our or our third party providers\u2019 data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, an unintentional disclosure of customer information. Additionally, despite our security procedures or those of our third party providers, information systems may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, obtain, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 data. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of business collaboration and communications solutions and could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, as well as government investigations and claims for damages or injunctive relief under state, federal and foreign laws.\nWe also depend on third parties for hardware and software, and our consumer services depend on third parties for content. Such products and content could contain defects or inaccurate information. Problems arising from our use of such hardware or software or third party content could require us to incur significant costs or divert the attention of our technical or other personnel from our product development efforts or to manage issues related to content. To the extent any such problems require us to replace such hardware or software we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms, if at all.\nPrivacy concerns relating to the Internet could result in new legislation, negative public perception and/or user behavior that negatively affect our business.\nWe collect data from live online Internet user dialogues and enable our customers to capture and save information about their Internet user interactions. To the extent that additional legislation regarding Internet user privacy is enacted, such as legislation governing the collection and use of information regarding Internet users through the use of cookies or similar technologies, the effectiveness of the LivePerson services could be impaired by restricting us from collecting or using information which may be valuable to our customers and/or exposing us to lawsuits or regulatory investigations. The foregoing could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, privacy concerns may cause Internet users to avoid online sites that collect various forms of data, such as behavioral information and even the perception of security and privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our services. In addition, we or our customers may be harmed by any laws or regulations that restrict the ability to collect, transmit or use this data. The European Union and many countries within the European Union have adopted privacy directives or laws that are often more strict than those in the United States. In the United States federal and state governments have also adopted legislation, rules and regulations which govern the collection, use, storage and protection of personal information and other data from online users. For instance, the United States Federal Trade Commission has also taken action against website operators who do not comply with their stated privacy policies. Furthermore, other foreign jurisdictions have adopted legislation governing the collection, use, storage and protection of personal information. These and other governmental or industry efforts are greatly expanding and may limit our or our customers\u2019 ability to collect and use information about their interactions with their Internet users through our services. Further, many governments are expanding laws that may give consumers or customers the right to access, modify and delete data that we or our customer\u2019s hold as part of our business operations. Worldwide data privacy and security laws are in a state of flux, and their precise applicability and interpretation will continue to be developing by agencies and courts. As a result, such laws, regulations and efforts could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation or regulatory costs or increased service delivery costs, or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to legal liability and/or negative publicity for the services provided to consumers via our technology platforms.\nOur technology platforms enable representatives of our customers as well as individual service providers to communicate with consumers and other persons seeking information or advice on the Internet. The law relating to the liability of online platform providers such as us for the activities of users of their online platforms is often challenged in the United States and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our technology platforms from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content via our technology platforms, or from behaving in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our technology platforms.\nClaims could be made against online services companies under both United States and foreign law such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, data breach, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our technology platforms. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, is intended, among other things, to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or rights of others. Additionally, portions of The Communications Decency Act, or CDA, are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content. A safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the DMCA to certain online service providers that provide specific services, if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the DMCA. Important questions regarding the safe harbor under the DMCA and the CDA have yet to be litigated, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA or of the CDA. If we are not covered by a safe harbor, for any reason, we could be exposed to claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nOur consumer service allows consumers to provide feedback regarding service providers. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of defamation or other injury could be made against us for content posted on our websites. Our liability for such claims may be higher in jurisdictions outside the United States where laws governing Internet transactions are unsettled.\nIf we become liable for information provided by our users and carried via our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business.\nIn addition, negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our technology platforms could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand.\nIn the future, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings, either of which could harm our business. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the sale of unlawful services or the unlawful sale of services could harm our business.\nIn addition to privacy legislation, any new legislation or regulation regarding the Internet, software sales or export and/or the cloud or Software-as-a-Service industry, and/or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet, software sales or export and/or the cloud or Software-as-a-Service industry could create new legal or regulatory burdens on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, as we operate outside the United States, the international regulatory environment relating to the Internet, software sales or export, and/or the Software-as-a-Service industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management.\nWe are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights against us or against our customers for use of our products. Certain of our customer contracts contain indemnification obligations requiring us to indemnify our customers from certain claims arising from the use of our services. Substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. In the ordinary course of our business, our services and/or our customers\u2019 use of our services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as claims by non-practicing entities become more prevalent and the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps. Some of our competitors in the market for real-time sales, marketing and customer service solutions or other third parties may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology. Any claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant amounts in litigation (even if the claim is invalid), distract management from other tasks of operating our business, pay substantial damage awards, prevent us from selling our products, delay delivery of the LivePerson services, require the development of non-infringing software, technology, business processes, systems or other intellectual property (none of which might be successful), or limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims, unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties (which may be costly, unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all). Therefore, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depend, in part, upon the protection of our intellectual property rights relating to the technology underlying the LivePerson services. It is possible that:\n\u2022\nany issued patent or patents issued in the future may not be broad enough to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nany issued patent or any patents issued in the future could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties, which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in the patents;\n\u2022\ncurrent and future competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our services or design around any patents we may have; and\n\u2022\neffective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective.\nFurther, to the extent that the invention described in any United States patent was made public prior to the filing of the patent application, we may not be able to obtain patent protection in certain foreign countries. We also rely upon copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law in the United States. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. Any steps we might take may not be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties. Similarly, third parties may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology, processes or other intellectual property. Third parties may register marks that are confusingly similar to the trademarks or services marks that we have used in the United States and our failure to monitor foreign registrations or mark usage may impact out rights in certain trademarks or services marks. Policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business, where our services are sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology\nwithout paying us for it. If this occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, disputes concerning the ownership or rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to litigate, may distract management from operating our business and may result in our loss of significant rights.\nTechnological or other defects could disrupt or negatively impact our services, which could harm our business and reputation.\nWe face risks related to the technological capabilities of our services. We expect the number of interactions between our customers\u2019 operators and Internet users over our system to increase significantly as we expand our customer base. Our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume. Additionally, we must continually upgrade our software to improve the features and functionality of our services in order to be competitive in our markets. If future versions of our software contain undetected errors, our business could be harmed. If third-party content is flawed, our business could be harmed. As a result of software upgrades at LivePerson, our customer sites have, from time to time, experienced slower than normal response times and interruptions in service. If we experience system failures or degraded response times, our reputation and brand could be harmed. We may also experience technical problems in the process of installing and initiating the LivePerson services on new web hosting services. These problems, if not remedied, could harm our business.\nOur services also depend on complex software which may contain defects, particularly when we introduce new versions onto our servers. We may not discover software defects that affect our new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed. It is possible that, despite testing by us, defects may occur in the software. These defects could result in:\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nlost sales;\n\u2022\ndelays in or loss of market acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022\nunexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors.\nThe non-payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of customers may negatively impact our financial condition or make it difficult to forecast our revenues accurately.\nDuring 2014, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $0.1 million to approximately $1.3 million, principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales. A large proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate customers that typically have longer payment cycles. During 2013, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $0.5 million to approximately $1.2 million, principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales. As a result of increasingly long payment cycles, we have faced increased difficulty in predicting our operating results for any given period, and have experienced significant unanticipated fluctuations in our revenues from period to period. Any failure to achieve anticipated revenues in a period could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur services are subject to payment-related risks.\nFor certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower our profit margins. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThrough our consumer-facing platform, we facilitate online transactions between individual service providers who provide online advice and information to consumers. In connection with these services, we accept payments using a variety of methods, such as credit card, debit card and PayPal. These payments are subject to \u201cchargebacks\u201d when consumers dispute payments they have made to us. Chargebacks can occur whether or not services were properly provided. Susceptibility to chargebacks puts a portion of our revenue at risk. We take measures to manage our risk relative to chargebacks and to recoup properly charged fees, however, if we are unable to successfully manage this risk our business and operating results could be adversely affected. As we offer new payment options to our users, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, and fraud.\nWe are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business.\nDelays in our implementation cycles could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain of our products require some implementation services, including but not limited to, training our customers. We have historically experienced a lag between signing a customer contract and recognizing revenue from that customer. Although\nthis lag has typically ranged from 30 to 90 days, it may take more time between contract signing and recognizing revenue in certain situations. If we experience delays in implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner, we could be obligated to devote more customer support, engineering and other resources to a particular project. If new or existing customers cancel or have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services, support, or customized features, revenue recognition could be canceled or delayed and our costs could increase, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nIn the past, we have experienced losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $92.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and we may incur losses in the future.\nWe have in the past incurred, and we may in the future, incur losses and experience negative cash flow, either or both of which may be significant. We recorded net losses from inception through the year ended December 31, 2003. We recorded net income for the years ended December 31, 2004 through 2007 and 2009 through 2012, while we recorded net losses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2013 and 2014.\nWe recorded a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was approximately $92.6 million. We cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Failure to maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWith the recent volatility in the capital markets, there is a risk that we could suffer a loss of principal in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and suffer a reduction in our interest income or in our return on investments.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $49.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We regularly invest excess funds from our cash and cash equivalents in short-term money market funds. We currently hold no mortgaged-backed or auction rate securities. However, some of our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the ongoing uncertainty in the United States and global credit markets that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused global credit and liquidity issues. In the future, these market risks associated with our investment portfolio may harm the results of our operations, liquidity and financial condition. Although we believe we have chosen a more cautious portfolio designed to preserve our existing cash position, it may not adequately protect the value of our investments. Furthermore, this more cautious portfolio is unlikely to provide us with any significant interest income in the near term.\nCapital needs necessary to execute our business strategy could increase substantially and we may not be able to secure additional financing to execute this strategy.\nTo the extent that we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business, or to pay for acquisitions, we may need to sell additional equity, issue debt or convertible securities or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions. In the past, we have obtained financing principally through the sale of preferred stock, common stock and warrants. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt or preferred equity securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock, and could have terms that impose restrictions on our operations. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities, our stockholders could suffer dilution. We cannot assure you that additional funding, if required, will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund any potential expansion, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. Those limitations would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that our current or future stock repurchase programs will enhance/has enhanced long-term stockholder value and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\nOn December 10, 2012, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program through June 30, 2014. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock, in the open market or privately negotiated transactions, at times and prices considered appropriate by the Board of Directors depending upon prevailing market conditions and other corporate considerations. On March 13, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors increased the aggregate purchase price limit of the stock repurchase program from $30.0 million to $40.0 million. On July 23, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the program out to December 31, 2014 and also increased the aggregate purchase price limit of the stock repurchase program from $40.0 million to $50.0 million. On March 5, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the program out to December 31, 2016. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market conditions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact\nour ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $10.3 million remained available for purchase under the program.\nFailure to license necessary third party software for use in our products and services, or failure to successfully integrate third party software, could cause delays or reductions in our sales, or errors or failures of our service.\nWe license third party software that we plan to incorporate into our products and services. In the future, we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer requirements. These licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Some of this technology could be difficult to replace once integrated. The loss of, or inability to obtain, these licenses could result in delays or reductions of our applications until we identify, license and integrate or develop equivalent software, and new licenses could require us to pay higher royalties. If we are unable to successfully license and integrate third party technology, we could experience a reduction in functionality and/or errors or failures of our products, which may reduce demand for our products and services.\nThird-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the impact of new technology integration on our existing technology, open source software disclosure risks, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nWe believe our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nOur reputation depends, in part, on factors which are partially or entirely outside of our control.\nOur services typically appear under the LivePerson brand or as a LivePerson-branded icon on our customers\u2019 websites. The customer service operators who respond to the inquiries of our customers\u2019 Internet users are employees or agents of our customers; they are not our employees. The experts who respond to the inquiries of Internet users are independent consultants or agents of our customers; they are not our employees. As a result, we are not able to control the actions of these operators or experts. In addition, an Internet user may not know that the operator or expert is not a LivePerson employee. If an Internet user were to have a negative experience in a LivePerson-powered real-time dialogue, it is possible that this experience could be attributed to us, which could diminish our brand and harm our business. Finally, we believe the success of our business services is aided by the prominent placement of the chat icon on a customer\u2019s website, over which we also have no control.\nOur products are complex, and errors, failures or \u201cbugs\u201d may be difficult to correct.\nOur products are complex, integrating hardware, software and elements of a customers\u2019 existing infrastructure. Despite quality assurance testing conducted prior to the release of our products our software may contain \u201cbugs\u201d that are difficult to detect and fix. Any such issues could interfere with the expected operation of a solution, which might negatively impact customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins. Depending upon the size and scope of any such issue, remediation may have a negative impact on our business. Our inability to cure an application or product defect, should one occur, could result in the failure of an application or product line, damage to our reputation, litigation and/or product reengineering expenses. Our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover expenses associated with such events.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, declines in business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 or more months. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions or cancellations of existing subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Our subscription model also means that revenue from new customers is generally recognized over the applicable subscription term, rather than instantaneously.\nOur sales cycles can be lengthy, and timing of sales can be difficult to predict.\nThe sales cycle for our products can be several months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer. Because we sell complex, integrated solutions, it can take many months to close sales as customers evaluate our product offering and define their requirements. Our multi-product offering and the increasingly complex needs of our customers can contribute to a longer sales cycle. Consequently, we are not always able to precisely predict the quarter in which expected sales will occur. In addition, historically a large portion of our revenue has derived from large orders from large clients. Consequently, delays in the closing of sales, especially from large clients, could have a material impact on the timing of revenue and results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and military conditions in Israel could negatively impact our Israeli operations\nOur product development staff, help desk and online sales support operations are located in Israel. As of December 31, 2014, we had 419 full-time employees in Israel. Although substantially all of our sales to date have been made to customers outside Israel, we are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations. During the summer of 2006, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party, and since March 2011, there has been a civil war in Syria, Israel\u2019s neighboring country to the north. Occasionally, violence from Syria has spilled over across Israel\u2019s border, and Israel has responded militarily several times since the onset of the civil war. During November 2012 and July 2014, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, a militia group and political party which controls the Gaza Strip. These conflicts involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nParties with whom we do business may sometimes decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.\nRecent popular uprisings in various countries in the Middle East and northern Africa are affecting the political stability of those countries. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political and trade relationships that exist between the State of Israel and these countries, as well as potentially affecting the global economy and marketplace through changes in oil and gas prices. In addition, Iran has publicly threatened to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This situation may potentially escalate in the future to violent events which may negatively affect Israel.\nOur commercial insurance may not cover losses that could occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect our business and could harm our results of operations.\nFurthermore, several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israeli companies and other companies that have operations in Israel, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and companies that have operations in Israel if hostilities in the region continue or intensify. Such restrictions may seriously limit our ability to sell our products to customers in those countries.\nContinued hostilities between Israel and its neighbors and any future armed conflict, terrorist activity or political instability in the region could adversely affect our operations in Israel and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further escalation of tensions or violence might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our Israeli employees and might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Israel and our business.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism or computer viruses.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, other acts of nature, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, cyber-attacks or failures, pandemics or other public health crises, or similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. Our principal executive offices are located in New York City and our largest office is located in Israel, each of which regions has experienced acts of terrorism in the past. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, cyber-attacks or failures, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems,\nwhich could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer data. Although we have disaster recovery capabilities, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from business interruption as a result of any such events. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high quality service to our customers, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, result in loss of existing or potential customers and increased expenses, and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the reputation of our products and services, any of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nFuture regulation of the Internet may slow our growth, resulting in decreased demand for our services and increased costs of doing business.\nState, federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies that conduct business online or that adversely affect the growth or use of the Internet. For example, these laws and regulations could discourage communication by e-mail or other web-based communications, particularly targeted e-mail of the type facilitated by our services, which could reduce demand for our services. Laws or regulations that affect the use of the Internet, including but not limited to laws affecting net neutrality could also decrease demand for our services and increase our costs. Further, regulatory focus on data privacy and data security continues to expand on a worldwide basis and is becoming more complex, which will increase the risks to our business on reputational, operational, and compliance bases.\nThe continued growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that will inhibit the use of Internet-based communications or the information contained in these communications or the ways in which information may be collected, stored, used and transferred in the course of providing services. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the expansion of the Internet. A decline in the growth of the Internet, particularly as it relates to online communication, could decrease demand for our services and increase our costs of doing business, or otherwise harm our business. Any new legislation or regulations, application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and other online services could increase our costs and harm our growth.\nWe depend on the continued viability of the infrastructure of the Internet.\nTo the extent that the Internet continues to experience growth in the number of users and frequency of use by consumers resulting in increased bandwidth demands, we cannot assure you that the infrastructure for the Internet will be able to support the demands placed upon it. The Internet has experienced outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. Outages or delays could adversely affect online sites, email and the level of traffic on the Internet. The Internet is also subject to continued and ongoing cyber attacks and related conduct, which affect all online businesses. We also depend on Internet service providers that provide our customers and Internet users with access to the LivePerson services. In the past, users have experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our service. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity. Insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the Internet also could result in slower response times and negatively impact use of the Internet generally, and our customers\u2019 sites (including the LivePerson dialogue windows) in particular. If the infrastructure of the Internet does not effectively support the growth of the Internet, we may not maintain profitability and our business, results of operations and financial condition will suffer.\nWe are dependent on the continued growth and acceptance of the Internet as a medium for commerce, and the related expansion of the Internet infrastructure.\nWe cannot be sure that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will continue to use the Internet as a medium for commerce. Convincing our customers to offer real-time sales, marketing and customer service technology may be difficult. The continuation of the Internet as a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncontinued growth in the number of users;\n\u2022\nconcerns about transaction security or security problems such as \u201cviruses\u201d and \u201cworms\u201d or hackers;\n\u2022\nconcerns about cybersecurity attacks or the security of confidential information online;\n\u2022\ncontinued development of the necessary technological infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of enabling technologies;\n\u2022\nuncertain and increasing government regulation; and\n\u2022\nthe development of complementary services and products.\nOther Risks\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations in the future, which could reduce the value of your investment and subject us to litigation.\nFluctuations in market price and volume are particularly common among securities of Internet and other technology companies. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to be highly volatile, with extreme price and volume fluctuations, in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of publicly-traded companies in general and Internet and other technology companies in particular;\n\u2022\nour announcements of significant customer contracts, acquisitions and our ability to integrate these acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nour failure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks against the United States, in Israel, the United Kingdom, or other locations where we operate; and/or the engagement in hostilities or an escalation of hostilities by or against the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom or other locations where we operate, or the declaration of war or national emergency by the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom or other locations where we operate.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation, which could result in substantial costs and distract management from other important aspects of operating our business.\nOur common stock is traded on more than one market and this may result in price variations.\nShares of our common stock are currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (\u201cTASE\u201d). Trading in our common stock on these markets takes place in different currencies (U.S. dollars on the NASDAQ and New Israeli Shekels on the TASE), and at different times (resulting from different time zones, different trading days and different public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our common stock on these two markets may differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in the trading price of our common stock on one of these markets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock on the other market. Differences in trading prices on the two markets could negatively impact our trading price.\nOur stockholders who each own greater than five percent of the outstanding common stock and our named executive officers and directors will be able to influence matters requiring a stockholder vote.\nOur stockholders who each own greater than five percent of the outstanding common stock and their affiliates, and our named executive officers and directors, in the aggregate, and as of December 31, 2014, beneficially own approximately 48% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nFuture sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nIf we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants in the public market, or if our stockholders are perceived by the market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that market sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, such as our staggered Board of Directors, the manner in which director vacancies may be filled and provisions regarding the calling of stockholder meetings, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, such as advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, and applicable provisions of Delaware law, such as the application of business combination limitations, could impose similar difficulties. Further, provisions of our amended\nand restated certificate of incorporation relating to directors, stockholder meetings, limitation of director liability, indemnification and amendment of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws may not be amended without the affirmative vote of not less than 66.67% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as a single class) cast at a meeting of our stockholders called for that purpose. Our amended and restated bylaws may not be amended without the affirmative vote of at least 66.67% of our Board of Directors or without the affirmative vote of not less than 66.67% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as a single class) cast at a meeting of our stockholders called for that purpose.", "PERMNO": 88174, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LPSN"}
