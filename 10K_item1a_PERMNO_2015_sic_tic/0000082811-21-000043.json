{"cik": "82811", "company": "REGAL BELOIT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Strategy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition, liquidity, customers, suppliers, and the geographies in which we operate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic, demand and operational uncertainty. We have global operations, customers and suppliers, including in countries most impacted by COVID-19. Authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans or restrictions, increased border controls or closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions. We have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including embracing guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on social distancing, good hygiene, restrictions on employee travel and in-person meetings, and changes to employee work arrangements including remote work arrangements where feasible. The actions taken around the world to slow the spread of COVID-19 have also impacted our customers and suppliers, and future developments could cause further disruptions to us due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, as well as recent volatility in commodity markets, has negatively impacted demand for our products and could continue to do so in the future. Its effects could also result in further disruptions to our manufacturing operations, including higher rates of employee absenteeism, and supply chain, which could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. Additionally, the potential deterioration and volatility of credit and financial markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the spread and duration of the virus, potential actions taken by governmental authorities, and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover.\nWe expect to incur costs and charges as a result of restructuring activities such as facilities and operations consolidations and workforce reductions that we expect will reduce on-going costs, and those restructuring activities also may be disruptive to our business and may not result in anticipated cost savings.\nWe have been consolidating facilities and operations in an effort to make our business more efficient and expect to continue to review our overall manufacturing footprint. We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs and restructuring charges in connection with such consolidations, workforce reductions and other cost reduction measures that have adversely affected and, to the extent incurred in the future would adversely affect, our future earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, such actions may be disruptive to our business. This may result in production inefficiencies, product quality issues, late product deliveries or lost orders as we begin production at consolidated facilities, which would adversely impact our sales levels, operating results and operating margins. In addition, we may not realize the cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of such actions.\nOur ability to establish, grow and maintain customer relationships depends in part on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation, such as IoT, and marketplace acceptance of new and existing products, including products related to technology not yet adopted or utilized in certain geographic locations in which we do business.\nThe electric motor and power transmission industries in recent years have seen significant evolution and innovation, particularly with respect to increasing energy efficiency and control enhancements. Our ability to effectively compete in these industries depends in part on our ability to continue to develop new technologies and innovative products and product enhancements, including enhancements based on technological innovation such as IoT. Further, many large customers in these industries generally desire to purchase from companies that can offer a broad product range, which means we must continue to develop our expertise in order to design, manufacture and sell these products successfully. This requires that we make significant investments in engineering, manufacturing, customer service and support, research and development and intellectual property protection, and there can be no assurance that in the future we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments. If we are unable to meet the needs of our customers for innovative products or product variety, or if our products\nbecome technologically obsolete over time due to the development by our competitors of technological breakthroughs or otherwise, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs and devote significant resources to the development of products that ultimately are not accepted in the marketplace, do not provide anticipated enhancements, or do not lead to significant revenue, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur dependence on, and the price of, raw materials may adversely affect our gross margins.\nMany of the products we produce contain key materials such as steel, copper, aluminum and electronics. Market prices for those materials can be volatile due to changes in supply and demand, manufacturing and other costs, regulations and tariffs, economic conditions and other circumstances. We may not be able to offset any increase in commodity costs through pricing actions, productivity enhancements or other means, and increasing commodity costs may have an adverse impact on our gross margins, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn each of our Climate Solutions and Commercial Systems segments, we depend on revenues from several significant customers, and any loss, cancellation or reduction of, or delay in, purchases by these customers may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of the revenues of our motor businesses from several key OEM customers. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with these customers. We have long standing relationships with these customers and we expect these customer relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Our reliance on sales from customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these key customers. Some of our customers may in the future shift some or all of their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to other sources. The loss of one or more of our large customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to develop relationships successfully with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGoodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name intangible comprise a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill and the indefinite-lived trade name intangible have become impaired in the future, our results of operations and financial condition in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had goodwill of $1,518.2 million and an indefinite-lived trade name of $122.8 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. The indefinite-lived trade name intangible represents a long-standing brand acquired in a business combination and is assumed to have indefinite life. We review goodwill and the indefinite-lived trade name intangible at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about the future operating cash flows, growth rates, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. A reduction in net income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived trade name intangible would affect financial results. If we are required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived trade name intangible is determined, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nPortions of our total sales come directly from customers in key markets and industries. A significant or prolonged decline or disruption in one of those markets or industries could result in lower capital expenditures by such customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPortions of our total sales are dependent directly upon the level of capital expenditures by customers in key markets and industries, such as HVAC, refrigeration, power generation, oil and gas, and unit material handling or water heating. A significant or prolonged decline or disruption in one of those markets or industries may result in some of such customers delaying, canceling or modifying projects, or may result in nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell certain products for high volume applications, and any failure of those products to perform as anticipated could result in significant liability and expenses that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell a number of products for high volume applications, including electric motors used in pools and spas, residential and commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Any failure of those products to perform as anticipated could result in significant product liability, product recall or rework, or other costs. The costs of product recalls and reworks are not generally covered by insurance. If we were to experience a product recall or rework in connection with products of high volume applications, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOne of our subsidiaries that we acquired in 2007 is subject to numerous claims filed in various jurisdictions relating to certain sub-fractional motors that were primarily manufactured through 2004 and that were included as components of residential and commercial ventilation units manufactured and sold in high volumes by a third party. These ventilation units are subject to regulation by government agencies such as the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCPSC\u201d). The claims generally allege that the ventilation units were the cause of fires. Based on the current facts, we cannot assure you that these claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our subsidiary's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We cannot reasonably predict the outcome of these claims, the nature or extent of any CPSC or other remedial actions, if any, that our subsidiary or we on their behalf may need to undertake with respect to motors that remain in the field, or the costs that may be incurred, some of which could be significant.\nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we could become increasingly vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and interest rate trends, and our ability to obtain future financing may be limited.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had $1.1 billion in aggregate debt outstanding under our various financing arrangements, $611.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $499.8 million in available borrowings under our current revolving credit facility. Our ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt levels will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our current credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, our credit facilities contain financial and restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds or take advantage of business opportunities. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and debt service capability. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our indebtedness may have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more challenging for us to obtain additional financing to fund our business strategy and acquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate changes and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to finance acquisitions and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, manufacturing capacity expansion, business integration, research and development efforts and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our markets; and/or\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business strategies. If an event of default under our credit facility or senior notes were to occur, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.\nWe depend on certain key suppliers, and any loss of those suppliers or their failure to meet commitments may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for some materials or components required in the manufacture of our products. If any of those suppliers fail to meet their commitments to us in terms of delivery or quality, we may experience supply shortages that could result in our inability to meet our customers' requirements, or could otherwise experience an interruption in our operations that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nSales of products incorporated into HVAC systems and other residential applications are seasonal and affected by the weather; mild or cooler weather could have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nMany of our motors are incorporated into HVAC systems and other residential applications that OEMs sell to end users. The number of installations of new and replacement HVAC systems or components and other residential applications is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning during warmer months. Mild or cooler weather conditions during the spring and summer season often result in end users deferring the purchase of new or replacement HVAC systems or components. As a result, prolonged periods of mild or cooler weather conditions in the spring or summer season in broad geographical areas could have a negative impact on the demand for our HVAC motors and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our operating performance. In addition, due to variations in weather conditions from year to year, our operating performance in any single year may not be indicative of our performance in any future year.\nOur success is highly dependent on qualified and sufficient staffing. Our failure to attract or retain qualified personnel, including our senior management team, could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key associates and the contributions of talented associates in various operations and functions, such as engineering, finance, sales, marketing, manufacturing, etc. The skills, experience and industry contacts of our senior management team significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract or retain members of our senior management team and key talent could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Global Footprint\nWe operate in the highly competitive global electric motors and controls, power generation and power transmission industries.\nThe global electric motors and controls, power generation and power transmission industries are highly competitive. We encounter a wide variety of domestic and international competitors due in part to the nature of the products we manufacture and the wide variety of applications and customers we serve. In order to compete effectively, we must retain relationships with major customers and establish relationships with new customers, including those in developing countries. Moreover, in certain applications, customers exercise significant power over business terms. It may be difficult in the short-term for us to obtain new sales to replace any decline in the sale of existing products that may be lost to competitors. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our profitability.\nWe have continued to see a trend with certain customers who are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase product in order to reduce their costs and diversify their risk. As a result, we may lose market share to our competitors in some of the markets in which we compete.\nIn addition, some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies.\nWe may also choose to exit certain businesses, markets, or channels based on a variety of factors including our 80/20 initiatives.\nWe manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the US, and political, societal or economic instability or public health crises may present additional risks to our business.\nApproximately 19,300 of our approximate 23,000 total associates and 35 of our principal manufacturing and warehouse facilities are located outside the US. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, societal and economic instability, local labor market conditions, public health crises, breakdowns in trade relations, the imposition of tariffs and other trade restrictions, lack of reliable legal systems, ownership restrictions, the impact of government regulations, the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation or nationalization, and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue.\nUnfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climates in countries where we have operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d trade relations between the US and China, the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the \"USMCA\"), or the change in labor rates in Mexico.\nIn addition, as described in more detail above, the continued global spread of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our foreign subsidiaries are based on the US dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the applicable functional currency. These foreign operations have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency in the US dollar. Any increase in the value of the US dollar in relation to the value of the local currency, whether by means of market conditions or governmental actions such as currency devaluations, will adversely affect our revenues from our foreign operations when translated into US dollars. Similarly, any decrease in the value of the US dollar in relation to the value of the local currency will increase our operating costs in foreign operations, to the extent such costs are payable in foreign currency, when translated into US dollars.\nCommodity, currency and interest rate hedging activities may adversely impact our financial performance as a result of changes in global commodity prices, interest rates and currency rates.\nWe use derivative financial instruments in order to reduce the substantial effects of currency and commodity fluctuations and interest rate exposure on our cash flow and financial condition. These instruments may include foreign currency and commodity forward contracts, currency swap agreements and currency option contracts, as well as interest rate swap agreements. We have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, such hedging arrangements. By utilizing hedging instruments, we may forgo benefits that might result from fluctuations in currency exchange, commodity and interest rates. We also are exposed to the risk that counterparties to hedging contracts will default on their obligations. Any default by such counterparties might have an adverse effect on us.\nWorldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions and conditions in the global financial markets can affect our results of operations. Deterioration in the global economy could lead to higher unemployment, lower consumer spending and reduced investment by businesses, and could lead our customers to slow spending on our products or make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Worsening economic conditions could also affect the financial viability of our suppliers, some of which we may consider key suppliers. If the commercial, industrial, residential HVAC, power generation and power transmission markets significantly deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, our stock price could decrease if investors have concerns that our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current and/or acquired businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the US, and an increasingly greater portion of our assets and associates are located outside of the US which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.\nRisks Relating to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to litigation, including product liability and warranty claims that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product warranty and liability claims, contract disputes and environmental, asbestos, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. While we currently maintain general liability and product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any product liability claim may also include the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to certain state laws, may not be covered by insurance. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result of potential adverse outcomes, the expenses associated with defending such claims, the diversion of our management's resources and time and the potential adverse effect to our business reputation.\nInfringement of our intellectual property by third parties may harm our competitive position, and we may incur significant costs associated with the protection and preservation of our intellectual property.\nWe own or otherwise have rights in a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years, and we continue to actively pursue patents in connection with new product development and to acquire additional patents and trademarks through the acquisitions of other businesses. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. Our inability to protect this intellectual property generally, or the illegal breach of some or a large group of our intellectual property rights, would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. We have incurred in the past and may incur in the future significant costs associated with defending challenges to our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could incur significant costs and expenses or be prevented from selling certain products.\nWe may be subject to claims from third parties that our products or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated intellectual property rights. If we are involved in a dispute or litigation relating to infringement of third party intellectual property rights, we could incur significant costs in defending against those claims. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to technology that are important to our business, or be required to pay damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may incur costs or suffer reputational damage due to improper conduct of our associates, agents or business partners.\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to improper payments to government officials, bribery, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. If our associates, agents or business partners engage in activities in violation of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions, may incur costs associated with government investigations, or may suffer damage to our reputation.\nOur operations are highly dependent on information technology infrastructure, and failures, attacks or breaches could significantly affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, a problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or an intentional disruption of our IT systems by a third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, including costs relating to investigation and remediation actions.\nIT security threats via computer malware and other \u201ccyber-attacks,\u201d which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, could also result in unauthorized disclosures of information, such as customer data, personally identifiable information or other confidential or proprietary material, and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage our reputation. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks, and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these attacks may have on us. While we continuously seek to maintain robust information security mechanisms and controls, the impact of a material IT event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe have substantially completed the implementation of a global Enterprise Resource Planning (the \u201cERP\u201d) system that redesigned and deployed a common information system. We will continue to implement the ERP system throughout the business. The process of implementation can be costly and can divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of the business. As we implement the ERP system, some elements may not perform as expected. This could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety and have incurred and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with any environmental regulations, including more stringent environmental laws that may be imposed in the future, could subject us to future liabilities, fines or penalties or the suspension of production. In addition, if environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are repealed, made less burdensome or implemented at a later date, demand for our products designed to comply with such regulations may be unfavorably impacted.\nWe are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income and other taxes.\nWe are subject to US federal, state, and international income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities, including claims or litigation related to our interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations, could result in substantially higher taxes, could have a negative impact on our ability to compete in the global marketplace, and could have a significant adverse effect on our results or operations, financial conditions and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Merger, Acquisition and Divestiture Activity\nWe and Rexnord may be unable to satisfy the conditions or obtain the approvals required to complete the Rexnord Transaction.\nThe consummation of the Rexnord Transaction is subject to numerous conditions, including consummation of certain transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Rexnord, Land, Merger Sub and us (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) and the Separation and Distribution Agreement by and among Rexnord, Land and us, the receipt of the approval of Rexnord's and our shareholders, the receipt of regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions. Neither Rexnord nor we can make any assurances that the Rexnord Transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. Both Rexnord and we have and will continue to expend time and resources and incur expenses related to the proposed Rexnord Transaction.\nGovernmental agencies may not approve the Rexnord Transaction or may impose conditions to the approval of the Rexnord Transaction or require changes to the terms of the Rexnord Transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Rexnord Transaction, imposing costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the Rexnord Transaction or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the Rexnord Transaction. Any condition or change which results in a \u201cBurdensome Condition,\u201d as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement might cause Rexnord and/or us to restructure or terminate the Rexnord Transaction.\nBoth we and Land will need to obtain debt financing to complete the Rexnord Transaction. Although commitment letters have been obtained from various lenders, the obligations of the lenders under the commitment letters are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including, among others, the absence of any material adverse effect. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or, if not satisfied, waived by the lenders. If we are not able to obtain alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms, it could prevent the consummation of the Rexnord Transaction or materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations if the Rexnord Transaction is ultimately consummated.\nThe extent of the dividend, if any, that we may pay, and the number of shares of our common stock that we may issue, in the Rexnord Transaction are uncertain.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that, in order to preserve the tax-free nature of the Rexnord Transaction, the number of shares of our common stock that may be issued in the Rexnord Transaction is subject to increase at closing such that former shareholders of Land (together with certain \u201coverlapping shareholders\u201d of ours and former shareholders of Land), own at least 50.8% of our outstanding common stock immediately following consummation of the transaction for tax purposes (or, in certain other circumstances in which overlapping shareholders are not being counted for this purpose, 50.1% of such shares).\nIn addition, in connection with the Rexnord Transaction, the parties have agreed that Rexnord will seek a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) private letter ruling with respect to certain tax aspects of the Rexnord Transaction, including matters relating to the nature and extent of shareholders who may be counted as overlapping shareholders for purposes of determining the exchange ratio in the merger of Merger Sub with and into Land (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The extent of the overlapping shareholders that may be counted in determining the exchange ratio for the Merger will depend on whether an IRS ruling is received and the contents of such IRS ruling.\nIn the event that the number of shares that we issue at the closing of the Rexnord Transaction is increased in the manner described above, including as a result of our failure to be able to count our and Rexnord's overlapping shareholders, the Merger Agreement also provides that we will declare a special dividend to our shareholders in an amount that will depend on the number of shares being issued, but which may range in amount between zero and approximately $2.0 billion.\nThe extent of our and Rexnord's overlapping shareholders of is outside of our and Rexnord's control of and will not be known until the closing occurs. In addition, the grant of the IRS ruling is within the discretion of the IRS. We can offer no assurance concerning the extent of our and Rexnord's overlapping shareholdings at any closing of the Rexnord Transaction or assurance that the IRS ruling will be received.\nThe amount of debt that we may incur in connection with the Rexnord Transaction is uncertain and may be substantial.\nIn connection with the Rexnord Transaction, we have agreed that the entity we would acquire in the transaction, which we refer to as Land, will prior to its spin-off by Rexnord incur approximately $487.0 million of indebtedness in order to fund a cash payment to a subsidiary of Rexnord. Following the closing, this indebtedness would be indebtedness of our wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, as part of the Rexnord Transaction, we have agreed to assume approximately $92.0 million of unfunded pension liabilities of the PMC business. Further, as part of the Rexnord Transaction, we may be required pay a cash dividend to our shareholders in an amount between zero and approximately $2.0 billion, depending on the number of additional shares of Company common stock that may be issued in connection with the Rexnord Transaction in order to satisfy tax requirements applicable to a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. If a special dividend is paid, we expect to fund it with new indebtedness, and we have entered into a debt commitment letter to fund that amount, which is described in more detail under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d. The size of the dividend that will ultimately be declared is uncertain and will remain so until the closing. We have also entered into other financing arrangements in connection with the Rexnord Transaction and expect to pay substantial fees and expenses in connection with them.\nIn the event that our debt levels and debt service obligations increase substantially in connection with the Rexnord Transaction, we will have less cash flow available for our business operations, we could become increasingly vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and interest rate trends, and our ability to obtain future financing may be limited.\nOur ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our increased debt levels, and our ability to comply with financial and restrictive covenants with our lenders will be subject to the risks described above under \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Operations and Strategy - Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we could become increasingly vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and interest rate trends, and our ability to obtain future financing may be limited\u201d.\nOur failure to successfully integrate the PMC Business and any future acquisitions into its business within its expected timetable could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results and the market price of our common stock following the completion of the Rexnord Transaction.\nThe success of the Rexnord Transaction will depend, in large part, on our ability, as a combined company following the completion of the Rexnord Transaction, to realize the anticipated benefits of the Rexnord Transaction and on the sales and profitability of the combined company. To realize these anticipated benefits, the combined company must successfully integrate its businesses. This integration will be complex and time-consuming. The failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Rexnord Transaction.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022the failure to implement our business plan for the combined company;\n\u2022lost sales and customers as a result of our customers or customers of the PMC Business deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n\u2022risks associated with managing the larger and more complex combined company;\n\u2022integrating our personnel and the personnel of the PMC Business while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and service to customers;\n\u2022the loss of key employees;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022unexpected liabilities of the PMC Business;\n\u2022possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures; and\n\u2022the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022and potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Rexnord Transaction.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Rexnord Transaction could be adversely affected, or could reduce our sales or earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results after the Rexnord Transaction and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nApart from the Rexnord Transaction, as part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make, acquisitions. Our company\u2019s continued growth may depend on our ability to identify and acquire companies that complement or enhance our business on acceptable terms, but we may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions. We may not be able to integrate successfully its recent acquisitions, or any future acquisitions, operate these acquired companies profitably, or realize the potential benefits from these acquisitions.\nThe Company will incur significant costs related to the Rexnord Transaction that could have an adverse effect on its liquidity, cash flows and operating results.\nThe Company expects to incur significant one-time costs in connection with the Rexnord Transaction, including the cost of financing and other transaction costs, integration costs, and other costs that Company management believes are necessary to realize the anticipated synergies from the Rexnord Transaction. The incurrence of these costs may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, cash flows and operating results in the periods in which they are incurred.\nBusinesses that we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future, including the PMC Business, may have liabilities which are not known to us.\nWe have assumed liabilities of acquired businesses and may assume liabilities of businesses that we acquire in the future, including the PMC Business. There may be liabilities or risks that we fail, or are unable, to discover, or that we underestimate, in the course of performing our due diligence investigations of acquired businesses. Additionally, businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have made previous acquisitions, and we will be subject to certain liabilities and risks relating to these prior acquisitions as well. We cannot assure you that our rights to indemnification contained in definitive acquisition agreements that we have entered or may enter into will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we begin to operate acquired businesses, we may learn additional information about them that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or issues related to ongoing customer relationships or order demand.\nDivestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe continually evaluate the strategic fit of our businesses and products, which may result in divestitures. Any divestiture may result in write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, divestitures may result in asset impairment charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, products and personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key associates. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks associated with divestitures.\nGeneral Risks\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to our outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under our credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financing market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results, and interest expense related to our outstanding debt.\nOur operations can be negatively impacted by natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflict, political and governmental actions which could harm our business.\nNatural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the US and other governments in response to such events could cause damage or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers, or our customers, and could create political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or could disrupt our supply chain. We may also be negatively impacted by actions by the US or foreign governments which could disrupt manufacturing and commercial operations, including policy changes affecting taxation, trade, immigration, currency devaluation, tariffs, customs, border actions and the like, including, for example, the effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d trade relations between the US and China, the implementation of the USMCA, or the change in labor rates in Mexico.\nOur stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Among the factors that could affect our common stock price are those discussed above under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d as well as:\n\u2022domestic and international economic and political factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022quarterly fluctuation in our operating income and earnings per share results;\n\u2022decline in demand for our products;\n\u2022significant strategic actions by our competitors, including new product introductions or technological advances;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022cost increases in energy, raw materials, intermediate components or materials, or labor; and\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts.\nIn addition, stock markets may experience extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 58771, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "RBC"}
