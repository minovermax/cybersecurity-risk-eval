RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below with all of the other information we include in this report and the additional information in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\" or the \"Commission\"). These risks may result in material harm to our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In this event, the market price of our common stock may decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are dependent on the commercial success of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR.\nA substantial majority of our resources are focused on expanding the revenue generated by our approved products in the United States, Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022 defend our patents and intellectual property from generic competition;\n\u2022 maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers for Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR;\n\u2022 produce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of inventory of our products to meet demand;\n\u2022 continue to maintain a wide variety of internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities sufficient to build commercial sales of our products;\n\u2022 continue to maintain and grow widespread acceptance of our products from physicians, health care payors, patients, pharmacists and the medical community;\n\u2022 properly price and obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement of the product by governmental authorities, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors;\n\u2022 maintain compliance with ongoing FDA labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, safety and other post-market requirements;\n\u2022 manage our growth and spending as costs and expenses increase due to commercialization;\n\u2022 establish collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of our products in countries outside the United States, and such collaborators' ability to obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in such countries;\n\u2022 adequately protect against and effectively respond to any claims by holders of patents and other intellectual property rights that our products infringe their rights; and\n\u2022 adequately protect against and effectively respond to any unanticipated adverse effects or unfavorable publicity that develops in respect of our products, as well as the emergence of new or existing products as competition, which may be proven to be more clinically effective and cost-effective.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. In addition, we will need to continue investing substantial financial and management resources to maintain our commercial sales and marketing infrastructure and to recruit and train qualified marketing, sales and other personnel in support of our sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. In addition, we have certain revenue expectations with respect to the sale of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. If we cannot continue to\nachieve those revenue expectations with respect to Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, this would result in a material adverse impact on our anticipated revenue, earnings and liquidity.\nThe ability to produce Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR will be largely dependent on the ability of third-party manufacturers and collaborators. If they do not deploy the resources we would like them to, our revenue could then suffer. In addition, we could become embroiled in disputes with these parties regarding the terms of any agreements, their performance or intellectual property rights. Any dispute could disrupt the sales of our products and adversely affect our reputation and revenue. In addition, if any of our manufacturing or collaboration partners fail to effectively perform under our arrangements for any reason, or cannot perform as a result of circumstances beyond their control, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement partner on a timely basis, or at all, or on acceptable terms.\nContinued increase in sales of Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons including competing products or safety issues. If either Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR is not successful in gaining broad commercial acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nAny increase in sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR will be dependent on several factors including our ability to educate additional physicians and to increase physician awareness of the benefits and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products. The degree of further market acceptance of any of our products or market acceptance of approved product candidates among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022 availability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022 pricing and cost effectiveness;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing capability and strategies; and\n\u2022 ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIn addition, Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR will be subject to continual review by the FDA, and we cannot assure that newly discovered or reported safety issues will not arise. With the use of any newly marketed drug by a wider patient population, serious AEs may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the drug itself. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, cause us to modify how we market our approved products, subject us to substantial liabilities and adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In the event of a withdrawal of either Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR from the market, our revenues would decline significantly and our business would be seriously harmed and could fail.\nWe are dependent on the continued increase in sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR and the ability of our product candidates to receive regulatory approval.\nA substantial majority of our resources are focused on continuing to increase sales of our products Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR in the United States. We also expect to continue to expend significant time, resources and effort on the development of our product candidates. All of our product candidates are in development and subject to the risks of failure inherent in developing drug products. Accordingly, our ability to generate significant product revenues in the near term will depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully increase sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022 successfully complete our clinical trials;\n\u2022 receive marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 produce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of our product candidates to permit successful clinical development and commercialization;\n\u2022 establish commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022 build and maintain strong sales, distribution and marketing capabilities sufficient to launch commercial sales of our product candidates;\n\u2022 establish collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of our product candidates in countries outside the United States, and such collaborators' ability to obtain regulatory and reimbursement approvals in such countries;\n\u2022 secure acceptance of our product candidates from physicians, health care payors, pharmacies, wholesalers, patients and the medical community; and\n\u2022 manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to undertaking clinical trials and commercially launching product candidates.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. If we are unable to successfully complete these tasks, we may not be able to commercialize any of our other product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, in which case we may be unable to maximize our revenues to increase the growth of our business. In addition, if we experience unanticipated delays or problems, development costs could substantially increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively market and sell our products or product candidates, if approved, in the United States.\nWe have built our sales and marketing capabilities in the United States to commercialize Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. We have built such capabilities by investing significant amounts of financial and management resources. We have committed and will commit additional resources to develop and maintain our internal sales and marketing capabilities. Further, we could face a number of additional risks in maintaining our internal sales and marketing capabilities, including:\n\u2022 we may not be able to continue to attract and retain talented and qualified personnel to maintain effective marketing or sales capability;\n\u2022 the cost of establishing and maintaining marketing and sales capability may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, or any of our product candidates if approved by the FDA; and\n\u2022 our direct sales and marketing efforts may not continue to be successful.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales and marketing capabilities for our product candidates or are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may not be able to generate product revenues from these product candidates and that may prevent us from maintaining profitability.\nThe commercial success of our products and product candidates, once approved, depends upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community.\nPhysicians may not prescribe Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR or any of our product candidates if approved by the FDA at the levels which we anticipate, in which case we would not generate the revenues we anticipate. Market acceptance of any of our products or product candidates by physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community depends on, among other things:\n\u2022 our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022 acceptance by physicians and patients of each product or product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 perceived advantages of our products or product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration of our products or product candidates compared to existing treatments;\n\u2022 any labeling restrictions placed upon each product or product candidate in connection with its approval;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of the adverse side effects of each of our products or product candidates;\n\u2022 the clinical indications for which each of our products or product candidates are approved, including any potential additional restrictions placed upon each product or product candidate in connection with its approval;\n\u2022 prevalence of the disease or condition for which each product or product candidate is approved;\n\u2022 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including competitors and generic products;\n\u2022 the extent to which each product or product candidate is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations and the level of reimbursement;\n\u2022 any negative publicity related to our or our competitors' products or product candidates, including as a result of any related adverse side effects;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our or any current or future collaborators' sales, marketing and distribution strategies;\n\u2022 pricing and cost effectiveness; and\n\u2022 the availability of adequate reimbursement by third parties.\nFor example, new AEDs that were introduced in the market as NCEs historically have not quickly gained significant market share against existing molecules in the epilepsy market because physicians are often reluctant to change a patient's existing therapy (even for an NCE) and risk a breakthrough seizure or exacerbate tolerability issues in their patients. Although Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR are not NCEs, they are subject to the risk that they will not be able to gain significant market share against existing or new AEDs, particularly since their markets are dominated by low cost generic product offerings. If our products or product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenues from these products or product candidates to remain profitable.\nFinal marketing approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authorities may be delayed, limited, or denied, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nOur business depends on the successful development and commercialization of our products and product candidates. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign jurisdiction until we receive the requisite approvals from such jurisdiction. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. We cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenues from these product candidates, if any.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. For example, the FDA:\n\u2022 could reject or delay the marketing application for an NCE;\n\u2022 could determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022 could determine that the information provided by us was inadequate, contained clinical deficiencies or otherwise failed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for any indication;\n\u2022 may not find the data from bioequivalence studies and/or clinical trials sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or to obtain marketing approval in the United States, including any findings that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\n\u2022 may disagree with our trial design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies, bioequivalence studies and/or clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our trials;\n\u2022 may determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of our Section 505(b)(2) application of our product candidate is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs;\n\u2022 may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for the supply of raw materials, including the API used in our product candidates, wherein those deficiencies may result in interruption in the ability to supply product;\n\u2022 may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for the manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u2022 may approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials;\n\u2022 may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022 may not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nNotwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA's interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates would significantly limit our ability to generate revenues, and any\nfailure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenues.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to payment or reimbursement policies which, if not favorable for our products or product candidates, could hinder or prevent our commercial success.\nOur ability or our collaborators' ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates, including Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products have been approved for marketing by the FDA. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs, in some instances, by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications or encouraging the use of lower-cost generic AEDs. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any of the products that we develop and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Moreover, that level of reimbursement may change over time as a result of decisions made by payors. Reduced or partial payment or reimbursement coverage could make our products or product candidates, including Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, less attractive to patients and prescribing physicians. We also may be required to sell our products or product candidates at a discount, which would adversely affect our ability to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our products or product candidates or compete on price.\nWe expect that private insurers and managed care organizations will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of our products or product candidates, including Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for such products or product candidates and at what level. Moreover, they will consider the efficacy and cost effectiveness of comparable or competitive products in making reimbursement decisions for our products. Because each third-party payor individually approves payment or reimbursement, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process that could require us to provide scientific or clinical support for the use of each of our products or product candidates separately to each third-party payor. In some cases, it could take several months or years before a particular private insurer or managed care organization reviews a particular product, and we may ultimately be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage. Our competitors generally have larger organizations, as well as existing business relationships with third-party payors relating to their products. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of our products or product candidates from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Our products and product candidates may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products or product candidates on a profitable basis. Our business would also be adversely affected if private insurers, managed care organizations, the Medicare program or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products or product candidates will be reimbursed to a smaller set than we believe they are effective in treating.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly Canada and the countries of Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products or product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement for our products or product candidates is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, many managed care organizations negotiate the price of products and develop formularies which establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the managed care organization's patient population. If our products or product candidates are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate payment or reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, our market share and gross margins could be negatively affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and financial condition.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures due to the potential healthcare reforms discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the trend toward programs aimed at reducing health care costs and the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.\nOur failure to successfully develop and market products or product candidates would impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop and market additional product candidates. We may spend several years completing our development of any particular current or future internal product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage. The product candidates to which we allocate our resources may not end up being successful. In addition, because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select, discover and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022 exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022 disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u2022 incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022 higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022 difficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022 increased operating expenses;\n\u2022 impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022 inability to motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.\nFurther, any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nOur trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy or any other requirements of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval.\nWe may be unable to sufficiently demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval. We must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in well-controlled studies, and to the satisfaction of the FDA with respect to approval in the United States (and to the satisfaction of similar regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions with respect to approval in those jurisdictions), that each product candidate is safe and effective for use in the target indication. The FDA may require us to conduct or perform additional studies or trials to adequately demonstrate safety and efficacy, which could prevent or significantly delay our receipt of regulatory approval, increase clinical costs significantly, and, ultimately, delay the commercialization of that product candidate.\nIn addition, the results from the trials that we have completed for our product candidates may not be replicated in future trials, or we may be unable to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our product candidates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced development, even after promising results in earlier trials. If our product candidates are not shown to be safe and effective, our clinical development programs could be delayed or might be terminated.\nOur products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that limit their commercial potential or delay or prevent their regulatory approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt development and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and result in potential products liability claims. Undesirable side effects caused by any of our products could cause regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently halt sales of the products. Undesirable side effects that are caused by any of our products or product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole.\nImmediate release oxcarbazepine and topiramate, drug compounds upon which Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR are based, respectively, are known to cause various side effects, including but not limited to dizziness, paresthesia, headaches, cognitive deficiencies such as memory loss and speech impediment, digestive problems, somnolence, double vision, gingival enlargement, nausea, weight gain, oral malformation birth defects, visual field defects, and fatigue. The use of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR may cause similar side effects as compared to their reference products, or may cause additional or different side effects.\nIf these products cause side effects or if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by these products or product candidates, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of the product candidate or otherwise require us to take the approved product off the market;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require additional warnings, or a narrowing of the indication, on the product label;\n\u2022 we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the proper use of the medication and risks of side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022 we may be required to modify the product in some way;\n\u2022 the FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u2022 sales of approved products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining the commercial success of our products and product candidates and could substantially increase commercialization costs.\nIf other versions of extended or controlled release oxcarbazepine or topiramate are approved and successfully commercialized , then our business could be materially harmed.\nThird parties may and have received approval to manufacture and market their own versions of extended release oxcarbazepine or topiramate anti-epileptic drugs in the United States. For example, Upsher-Smith launched in the market Qudexy XR (extended release topiramate) and its own authorized generic, both of which compete with Trokendi XR. SinceTrokendi XR was not granted any marketing exclusivity by the FDA, we may not be able to prevent the submission or approval of another full NDA for any competitor's extended or controlled release topiramate product candidate. However, we do have the right to defend our products against third parties who may infringe or are infringing our patents.\nIn addition, we are aware of companies who are marketing modified-release oxcarbazepine products outside of the United States, such as Apydan, which is developed by Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH and requires twice-daily administration. If companies with modified-release oxcarbazepine products outside of the United States pursue or obtain approval of their products within the United States, such competing products may limit the potential success of Oxtellar XR in the United States, and our business and growth prospects would be materially impaired. Accordingly, if any third party is successful in obtaining approval to manufacture and market their own versions of extended release oxcarbazepine or topiramate in the United States, we may not be able to recover expenses incurred in connection with the development of or realize revenues from Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR.\nIf we do not obtain marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may suffer.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, three years of marketing exclusivity may be granted for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) applications, for, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration, or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This exclusivity, which is sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity, prevents the FDA from approving an application under Section 505(b)(2) for the same conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations before the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a Section 505(b)(1) NDA and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, nor would it prevent approval of a generic product or Section 505(b)(2) product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected changes of the approved drug product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, newly-approved drugs and indications may also benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same API, or active moiety, which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. Although protection under the\nHatch-Waxman Amendments will not prevent the submission or approval of another full Section 505(b)(1) NDA, such an NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. While the FDA granted a three year marketing exclusivity period for Oxtellar XR, it did not grant a similar marketing exclusivity period for Trokendi XR. If we are unable to obtain marketing exclusivity for our subsequent product candidates, then our competitors may obtain approval of competing products more easily than if we had such marketing exclusivity, and our future revenues could be reduced, possibly materially.\nDelays or failures in the completion of clinical development of our product candidates would increase our costs and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.\nDelays or failures in the completion of clinical trials for our product candidates could significantly raise our product development costs. We do not know whether current or planned trials will be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical development can be delayed or halted for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022 difficulties obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial or complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial;\n\u2022 delays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\"CROs\") trial sites and investigators, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs trial sites, and investigators;\n\u2022 insufficient or inadequate supply or quantity of a product candidate for use in trials;\n\u2022 difficulties obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022 challenges recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other programs for the treatment of similar conditions;\n\u2022 severe or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial;\n\u2022 difficulty retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues; and\n\u2022 clinical holds\nClinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, clinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (\"DSMB\") or ethics committee overseeing the clinical trial at a trial site (with respect to that site), the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial protocols;\n\u2022 observations during inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that ultimately result in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety issues; or\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the trial.\nIn addition, failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial protocols may also result in the inability to use the data to support product approval. Changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs or ethics committees for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a\nclinical trial. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate any of our clinical trials, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be materially harmed, and our commercial prospects and ability to generate product revenues will be diminished.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract, motivate and retain key members of our management team.\nWe may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our objectives.\nWe are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercial and financial expertise of our management, particularly Jack A. Khattar, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Khattar has an employment agreement and other members of the senior management team have executive retention agreements. If we lose key members of our management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion, if at all. We cannot be certain that future management transitions will not disrupt our operations and generate concern among employees and those with whom we do business.\nIn addition to the competition for personnel, our corporate officers are located in the greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area, an area that is characterized by a high cost of living. As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our Company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts.\nWe also have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours.\nWe expect intense competition and, if our competitors develop or market alternatives for treatments of our target indications, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our products and product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. The availability of new products or approvals for new indications of existing products may limit the demand for and the price we are able to charge for any of our products or product candidates that are commercialized unless we are able to differentiate them from competitive offerings. In addition to competition with our currently marketed products, we anticipate that we will face intense competition when our pipeline product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities and we begin the commercialization process for these products.\nThere are currently no marketed products and no known products in development for the treatment of impulsive aggression in patients with ADHD. However, the off-label use of risperidone (Risperdal) and aripiprazole (Abilify) is common. These products are approved for irritability in autism which, as a result, may influence use of the products for impulsive aggression symptoms observed in patients with ADHD.\nIn addition, several companies have various product candidates they are developing for ADHD and which may compete with our SPN-812 product candidate. Non-stimulant ADHD products in Phase III development include SEP-225289 (dasotraline), a dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, being developed by Sunovion, and MG01CI (metadoxine), an extended release version of pyrrolidone carboxylate of pyridoxine, which is being developed by Alcobra. Sunovion reported positive Phase III data in adults with SEP-225289 at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology meeting in 2014. An additional Phase III study in adults is planned, with pediatric work to follow. The Alcobra product did not meet its primary endpoint in an initial Phase III study reported in 2014. However, Alcobra plans additional Phase III work in adults in 2015 and has an ongoing Phase II study in adolescents.\nFurther, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies, may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. As a result, our products and product candidates may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in connection with their development or realize revenues from any commercialized product.\nFurther, many competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022 capital resources;\n\u2022 research and development resources and experience, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022 drug development, clinical trial and regulatory resources and experience;\n\u2022 sales and marketing resources and experience;\n\u2022 manufacturing and distribution resources and experience;\n\u2022 name recognition; and\n\u2022 resources, experience and expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit or block us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed or accepted or less costly than ours and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively with the products of our competitors or if such competitors are successful in developing products that compete with any of our product candidates that are approved, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated at competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment.\nOur products and our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval, may be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements.\nEven though U.S. regulatory approval has been obtained for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for costly post-approval studies. Our product candidates would also be, and our approved product and our collaborators' approved products are, subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are\nsubject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we, our collaborators or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as side effects of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product or the manufacturer, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we or our collaborators, or our or our collaborators' approved products or product candidates, or the manufacturing facilities for our or our collaborators' approved products or product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022 impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 suspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing bioequivalence and/or clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements, or suspension of production for a sustained period of time; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nIn addition, our product labeling, advertising and promotion of our approved products, and our product candidates upon FDA approval, are subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product's approved labeling. Physicians may nevertheless prescribe our products and, upon receiving FDA approval, our product candidates to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. The FDA and other authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, we may be enjoined from such off-label promotion and become subject to significant liability, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and revenues, if any.\nIf we fail to produce our products and product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our products or product candidates beyond Phase II clinical trials, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations for Phase III clinical materials or commercial products in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the supply of the APIs for our products or product candidates, including drug substance for our preclinical research and clinical trials. For Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, we currently rely on single suppliers for raw materials including API and single manufacturers to produce and package final dosage forms. Any future curtailment in the availability of raw materials could result in production or other delays with consequent adverse effects on us. In addition, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays or higher raw material costs.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Pharmaceutical companies often encounter difficulties in manufacturing, particularly in scaling up production of their products. These problems include manufacturing difficulties relating to production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. If we are unable to demonstrate stability in accordance with commercial requirements, or if our manufacturers were to encounter difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us, our ability to maintain or obtain FDA approval and market our products and product candidates, respectively, would be jeopardized. In addition, any delay or interruption in producing clinical trial supplies could delay or prohibit the completion of our bioequivalence and/or clinical trials, increase the costs associated with conducting our bioequivalence and/or clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or to terminate a trial.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products need to comply with cGMP requirements and other requirements as enforced by the FDA, including for electronic tracking and submission. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products and product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any of our products or product candidates is compromised due to failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate or successfully commercialize such products or product candidates, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay in clinical developments, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our products or product candidates, entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, if we fail to obtain the required commercial quantities on a timely basis from our suppliers and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for our approved products or product candidates, and would lose potential revenues.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our products or product candidates, the sales of those products or product candidates would be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \"listed drug\" which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The FDCA, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or labeling, as our product and product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our products and product candidate. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market. Companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, regardless of the regulatory approval pathway, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our products and product candidates would materially and permanently adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our products and product candidates. In particular, as disclosed in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we received Paragraph IV Notice\nLetters against our Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR Orange Book patents from several generic drug makers. We have filed a lawsuit against each of these drug makers alleging infringement of our Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR patents. While we intend to vigorously defend our product rights, in the event that we are not successful in these lawsuits, our future sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR will be significantly, adversely and permanently affected by competition from these generic drug manufacturers.\nWe intend to rely on third-party collaborators to market and commercialize our products and product candidates outside of the United States, who may fail to effectively commercialize our products and product candidates.\nOutside of the United States, we utilize strategic partners where appropriate, to assist in the commercialization of our products and product candidates, if approved. We currently possess limited resources and may not be successful in establishing collaborations or co-marketing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. We also face competition in our search for collaborators and co-promotion partners. By entering into strategic collaborations or similar arrangements, we will rely on third parties for financial resources and for development, commercialization, sales and marketing and regulatory expertise. Our collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our products and product candidates because they cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, they lack adequate financial or other resources or they decide to focus on other initiatives. Any failure of our third-party collaborators to successfully market and commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States would diminish our revenues and harm our results of operations.\nLimitations on our patent rights relating to our products and product candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nTo a significant degree, our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technologies and our product candidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. To that end, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad (including Europe, Canada and certain other countries when appropriate) relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business.\nThe strength of patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or more. As a result, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents and pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. In addition, we cannot be certain that our patent applications will be granted, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property or that such patents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. It is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade\nsecrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Any failure to adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the United States, and therefore, we may encounter problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it could be costly and time consuming to defend such a suit. An unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell their approved products and our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our collaborators' approved products and our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. There may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware, that may be infringed by our collaborators' approved products or Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR, which could prevent us from being able to maximize revenue generated by Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR or any of our product candidates, respectively. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications which may later result in issued patents that our collaborators' approved products or our product candidates may infringe.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties alleging that our collaborators' approved products or our products or product candidates infringe their intellectual property rights. If one of our collaborators' approved products or our products or product candidates is found to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we or our collaborators could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize the applicable approved products and product candidates unless we obtain a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our approved products, pending a trial on the merits, which may not occur for several years.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry generally. If a third party claims that we or our collaborators infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management's attention from our core business;\n\u2022 substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party's rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner's attorneys' fees;\n\u2022 a court prohibiting us from selling Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, or any product candidate approved in the future, if any, unless the third party licenses its rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022 if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees or grant cross-licenses to our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 redesigning Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, or any of our product candidates so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. For example, we are involved in several matters related to Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters that we have received in connection with our products and our collaborators' products. In connection with an ANDA, a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter notifies the FDA that one or more patents listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Product List (Orange Book) is alleged to be invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the ANDA product. These matters include claims related to Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR are discussed in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\nIn any infringement proceeding, including the foregoing, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent application at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our collaborators, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceeding or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, or perceive that the presence or continuation of these cases creates a level of uncertainty regarding our ability to increase or sustain products sales, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that our products or product candidates will not be subject to the same risks.\nWe depend on collaborators to work with us to develop, manufacture and commercialize their and our products and product candidates.\nWe have a license agreement with United Therapeutics Corporation to use one of our proprietary technologies for an oral formulation of treprostinil diethanolamine, or treprostinil, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (\"PAH\"), as well as for other indications. On December 20, 2013, United Therapeutics Corporation announced that the FDA had approved Orenitram (treprostinil). United Therapeutics Corporation launched this product in 2014, which triggered a milestone payment due to us of $2.0 million. In the third quarter of 2014 we recognized $30.0 million in revenue from HeatlhCare Royalty Partners III, L.P.'s purchase of certain of our rights under our license agreement with United Therapeutics Corporation related to the commercialization of Orenitram. We will retain full ownership of the royalty rights after a certain threshold payment to Health Care Royalty Partners has been reached. We are entitled to receive milestones and royalties for use of this formulation in\nother indications. If we materially breach any of our obligations under the license agreement, however, we could lose the potential to receive any future royalty payments thereunder, which could be financially significant to us.\nWe also have license agreements with Especificos Stendhal, S.A., DE C.V. and we may enter into additional collaborations in the future. Our future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. Much of the potential revenues from these future collaborations may consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving development milestones and royalties payable on sales of developed products. The milestone and royalty revenues that we may receive under these collaborations will depend upon our collaborators' ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new products. Future collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our products, product candidates or technologies because they, among other things, may:\n\u2022 change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our product candidates. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re-evaluated their development and commercialization priorities following mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years in these industries. The ability of some of our product candidates to reach their potential could be limited if our future collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those product candidates;\n\u2022 decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise or limited cash resources, or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining marketing approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u2022 develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the product candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us;\n\u2022 not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the product candidate through clinical development, marketing approval and commercialization;\n\u2022 fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 not be able to obtain the necessary marketing approvals; or\n\u2022 breach or terminate their arrangement with us.\nIf collaboration partners fail to develop or effectively commercialize our products or product candidates for any of these reasons, we may not be able to replace the collaboration partner with another partner to develop and commercialize the product or product candidate under the terms of the collaboration. Further, even if we are able to replace the collaboration partner, we may not be able to do so on commercially favorable terms. As a result, the development and commercialization of the affected product or product candidate could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of the product candidate on our own, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for certain of our activities, including clinical research of our product candidates and manufacturing of our compounds and product candidates beyond Phase II clinical trials.\nWe rely on outsourcing arrangements for some of our activities, including manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research, data collection and analysis, and electronic submission of regulatory filings. We may have limited control over these third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their\nobligations in an effective and timely manner. Our reliance on third parties, including third-party CROs and CMOs entails risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 non-compliance by third parties with regulatory and quality control standards;\n\u2022 sanctions imposed by regulatory authorities if compounds supplied or manufactured by a third party supplier or manufacturer fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards;\n\u2022 the possible breach of the agreements by the CROs or CMOs because of factors beyond our control or the insolvency of any of these third parties or other financial difficulties, labor unrest, natural disasters or other factors adversely affecting their ability to conduct their business; and\n\u2022 termination or non-renewal of an agreement by the third parties, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our products or product candidates beyond Phase II clinical trials, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations for Phase III clinical materials or commercial products in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party CMOs for all of our required raw materials and drug substance for our preclinical research and clinical trials. For Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, we currently rely on single suppliers for raw materials, including API, and rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the final commercial products. If any of these vendors are unable to perform their obligations to us, including due to violations of the FDA's requirements, our ability to meet regulatory requirements or projected timelines and necessary quality standards for successful manufacture of the various required lots of material for our development and commercialization efforts would be adversely affected. Further, if we were required to change vendors, it could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs. Accordingly, the loss of any of our current or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe have entered into supply agreements for both Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR with leading CMOs headquartered in North America for the manufacture of the final commercial products. However, there is a risk that the counterparties to these agreements will not perform their respective obligations or will terminate these agreements. In addition, we do not have contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of all of our product candidates. The number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture drug substance and final drug product on a commercial scale is limited. Therefore, we may not be able to enter into such arrangements with third-party manufacturers in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to secure such contractual arrangements would harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe have in-licensed or acquired a portion of our intellectual property necessary to develop certain of our psychiatry product candidates, and if we fail to comply with our obligations under any of these arrangements, we could lose such licenses or intellectual property rights.\nWe are a party to and rely on several arrangements with third parties, such as those with Afecta and Rune, which give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary for the development of certain of our product candidates including SPN-810 and SPN-809, respectively. In addition, we may enter into similar arrangements in the future for other product candidates. Our current arrangements impose various development, financial and other obligations on us. If we materially breach these obligations or if Afecta or Rune fail to adequately perform their respective obligations, these exclusive arrangements could be terminated, which would result in our inability to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by such intellectual property.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the United States, we or our collaborators may never receive approval to commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and greater than those in the United States. The time required to obtain approval in other jurisdictions might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. For example, legislation analogous to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA in the United States, which relates to the ability of an NDA applicant to use published data not developed by such applicant, may not exist in other countries. In territories where data is not freely available, we may not have the ability to commercialize our products without negotiating rights from third parties to refer to their clinical data in our regulatory applications, which could require the expenditure of significant additional funds.\nIn addition, regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory processes in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions or any delay or setback in obtaining such approvals could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that any of our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on their commercial potential or require costly post-marketing studies.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products and product candidates.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products and product candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. Recommendations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of our products or product candidates or the use of competitive or alternative products that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products or product candidates.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products and product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for any product or product candidate that has received approval and is being commercialized;\n\u2022 impairment of our business reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n\u2022 withdrawal of bioequivalence and/or clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022 costs of related litigation;\n\u2022 distraction of management's attention from our primary business;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022 loss of revenues; and\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nOur product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials is limited to $10 million per claim and $10 million in the aggregate, and covers bodily injury and property damage arising from our clinical trials, subject to industry-standard terms, conditions and exclusions. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash balance and adversely affect our business.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products or product candidates.\nThe U.S. government and other governments have shown significant and increased interest in pursuing healthcare reform. Government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce healthcare costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for any approved product or our product candidates which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nIn both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any approved product profitably. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for our products, which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law a legislative overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. These laws and their regulations, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, may have far reaching consequences for biopharmaceutical companies like us. As a result of the Healthcare Reform Law, substantial changes could be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including changes made in order to extend benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage or changing coverage parameters. Extending coverage to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services and drugs. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of private payors and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, creation of a government-sponsored healthcare insurance source, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the United States could impact the reimbursement for prescribed drugs, including our products and product candidates. If reimbursement for our approved products is substantially less than we expect in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nIn September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was enacted, expanding drug supply chain requirements and strengthening FDA's response to drug shortages, among other things. The FDA's exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to assure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of any approved product candidates. The Drug Quality and Security Act (\"DQSA\") became law on November 27, 2013. The DQSA creates the requirement for companies to trace, verify and identify all products across all changes of ownership from manufacturer to dispenser.\nFuture federal and state proposals and health care reforms could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the Health Care Reform Law by reducing the amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.\nImplementation of the Health Care Reform Law could cause us to incur significant compliance expenses or could subject us to substantial penalties and fines if our business is found to violate these requirements.\nThe Health Care Reform Law was signed into law in 2010. The Health Care Reform Law is multi-faceted and is being implemented in phases. The financial impact of all of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Law on our business is unclear, and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially harmed by future implementation of the Health Care Reform Law. In addition, if we are found not to be in full compliance with the Health Care Reform Law, we could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties and we could receive adverse publicity.\nThe Health Care Reform Law also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of the Health Care Reform Law, its underlying regulations, or other laws impacted by its implementation is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs a supplier of pharmaceuticals, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to patients' rights to privacy fraud and abuse are and will be applicable to our business. We could be\nsubject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations include:\n\u2022 the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022 federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests;\n\u2022 the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and\n\u2022 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback, Sunshine Act, and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impair our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nAs we continue to increase the size of our organization we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nOur personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support future growth. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our recent and any future growth. In 2014, we increased from 235 employees to 309 employees and increased revenues to $122.0 million in 2014 from $12.0 million in 2013. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we:\n\u2022 manage our regulatory approvals and clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022 manage our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators and other third parties;\n\u2022 commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022 improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 attract, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented employees.\nThis growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require our management to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In addition, our growth will cause us to comply with an increasing number of regulations and statutory requirements. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur activities and our third-party manufacturers' and suppliers' activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to federal, state, city and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures we use for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations, including our commercialization and research and development efforts. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently maintain biological or hazardous materials insurance coverage.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors and, as such, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our networks, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees and patients in our clinical trials. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, and could disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business.\nAny name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may object to any product name we submit if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. We have in the past been required to change a proposed product name. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate, and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nProvisions in our agreement with Shire impose restrictive covenants on us, which could limit our ability to operate effectively in the future.\nIn 2005, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Shire Laboratories Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to refrain perpetually from engaging in any research, formulation development, analytical testing, manufacture, technology assessment or oral bioavailability screening that relate to five specific drug compounds (amphetamine, carbamazepine, guanfacine, lanthanum and mesalamine) and any derivative thereof. Although these various restrictions and covenants on us do not currently impact our products, product candidates or business, they could in the future limit or delay our ability to take advantage of business opportunities that may relate to such compounds.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in the years prior to 2014.\nIn recent years, we have focused primarily on developing our current products and product candidates, with the goal of commercializing these products and supporting regulatory approval for these product candidates. We have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions:\n\u2022 private placements of convertible preferred stock;\n\u2022 our collaboration and license arrangements;\n\u2022 the monetization of certain future royalty streams under our existing licenses for Orenitram, Oracea, Sanctura XR, and Intuniv;\n\u2022 the sale of our subsidiary, Royalty Sub, which held the license rights to Oracea and Sanctura XR;\n\u2022 borrowing via secured loans;\n\u2022 the completion of our $52.3 million initial public offering in May 2012;\n\u2022 the completion of our follow-on $49.9 million equity offering in November 2012; and\n\u2022 the completion of our $90 million private placement offering of 7.50% Convertible Senior Secured Notes Due 2019 (the \"Notes\") in May 2013.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 2005. We incurred net losses of approximately $33.5 million, $38.5 million, $46.3 million and $92.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2013, respectively. We realized net income of approximately $0.5 million, $53.8 million and $19.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2011 and 2014 respectively, due to one-time, non recurring items. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $158.7 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development programs, expenses associated with launching our products, and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect our research and development costs to continue to be substantial and to increase with respect to our product candidates as we advance those product candidates through preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and other pre-approval activities. We expect our selling, general and administrative costs to continue to be substantial as we continue to support the ongoing commercialization of our products.\nOur prior losses have had an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital. While we anticipate maintaining profitability in 2015 and beyond, we cannot be certain that we will do so and any potential future losses, if and when they occur, could also have an adverse impact on our stockholders' equity and working capital. Furthermore, since the completion of our initial public offering in May 2012, we have incurred additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping product candidates, conducting clinical trials, establishing manufacturing relationships and marketing drugs are expensive and uncertain processes.\nIn addition, unforeseen circumstances may arise, or our strategic imperatives could change, causing us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, requiring us to seek to raise additional funds. We have no committed external sources of funds.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 our ability to successfully support our products in the marketplace and the rate of increase in the level of sales in the marketplace;\n\u2022 the rate of progress, clinical success, and cost of our trials and other product development programs for our product candidates;\n\u2022 the costs and timing of in-licensing additional product candidates or acquiring other complementary companies;\n\u2022 the timing of any regulatory approvals of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the actions of our competitors and their success in selling competitive product offerings; and\n\u2022 the status, terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements.\nAdditional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nOur ability to remain profitable depends upon our ability to generate increasing levels of revenues from sales of our products, particularly Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, and our product candidates once approved by the FDA. 2013 was the first year in which we generated revenue from our first commercial products, Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. Prior to the commercial launch of these products, our historical revenues have been generated through fees for development services and payment for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as royalties on product sales of Orenitram, Oracea, Sanctura XR and Intuniv licensed products and the sale or license of certain of our assets.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. We expect that any revenues we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of revenue from approved products, our license agreements, the amount of development milestones and product revenues received under our collaboration license agreements.\nOur net income and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022 our execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022 the level of market acceptance for any approved product candidate and underlying demand for that product and wholesalers' buying patterns;\n\u2022 variations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u2022 the success of our bioequivalence and clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;\n\u2022 any delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;\n\u2022 potential side effects of our products and our future products that could delay or prevent commercialization, cause an approved drug to be taken off the market, or result in litigation;\n\u2022 any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022 our dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our product candidates;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022 regulatory developments affecting our products and product candidates; and\n\u2022 changes in reimbursement environment and regulatory changes.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nComplying with increased financial reporting and securities laws reporting requirements has increased our costs and requires additional management resources. We may fail to meet all of these obligations.\nWe face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company. Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, for example, has resulted in significant initial cost to us as well as ongoing increases in our legal, audit and financial compliance cost. We anticipate that these costs will further increase when we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\", which we anticipate occurring on December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2015, we are transitioning from being a \"smaller reporting company\" to an \"accelerated filer\" status which will lead to further increases in our legal, audit, NASDAQ listing fees and financial compliance costs. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Our board of directors, management and outside advisors need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and require us to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nAs a public company, we are subject to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act relating to internal controls over financial reporting and we expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404(a). We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any necessary changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify or replace our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate consolidated financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. We cannot assure that our internal controls over financial reporting will prove to be effective.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after we no longer qualify as an \"emerging growth company,\" may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses; or may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b). We could be an \"emerging growth company\" until December 31, 2017 unless one of three events occur earlier than December 31, 2017; (1) we generate $1.0 billion of annual revenue at an earlier date, (2) we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt, or (3) we qualify as a large accelerated filer. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls will be very expensive and could detect problems that our management's assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our U.S. Federal and state net operating losses or U.S. Federal tax credits is currently limited, and may be limited further, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The limitations apply if an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period, which is typically three years or since the last ownership change. We are already subject to Section 382 limitations due to cumulative ownership changes that, as of November 15, 2013, totaled more than 50%. As of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $31.8 million and research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.6 million available. Future changes in stock ownership may also trigger an additional ownership change and, consequently, another Section 382 limitation. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards before utilization which would reduce our gross deferred income tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce U. S. Federal and state income tax may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future cash tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur significant level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and consequentially substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2014, we have issued and outstanding convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $36.1 million. Subject to certain conditions and limitations in the Indenture governing the Notes, we may also incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, to meet future financing needs.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important and significant effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, it could:\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including with respect to the Notes;\n\u2022 result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in the Indenture governing the Notes and any agreement governing our existing or future indebtedness. An event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022 reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes because we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022 subject us to increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our existing and future indebtedness, if any, with variable interest rates;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022 prevent us from raising funds necessary to repurchase Notes tendered to us if there is a \"fundamental change\" or pay the interest make-whole payment that may be due in cash in connection with certain conversions of the Notes under the Indenture governing the Notes;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness or are less highly leveraged and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our debt levels or leverage prevent us from exploiting; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nEach of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Notes and our future indebtedness, if any.\nOur ability to make payments with respect to the Notes and to satisfy any other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors affecting our company and industry, many of which are beyond our control.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have issued and outstanding convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $36.1 million, bearing an interest rate of 7.5% per annum. Servicing our indebtedness will require the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating expenses for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the cash flow from operations in the future may be insufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we raise additional debt, it could increase our interest expense, leverage and operating financial costs. In addition, the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Our lack of cash resources or failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to affect any of these alternatives could significantly and adversely affect our ability to pay amounts due under the Notes.\nThe Indenture governing the Notes contains restrictions that will limit our operating flexibility, and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions.\nThe Indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our and our existing and future subsidiaries' ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest. These covenants include restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock;\n\u2022 make investments in our foreign subsidiaries; and\n\u2022 enter into mergers, consolidations or sales or leases of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively.\nA breach of any of these covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable. This, in turn, could cause our other debt to become due and payable as a result of cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing such other debt. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such debt.\nWe may not be permitted, by the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness, to pay any interest make-whole payment upon conversion in cash, requiring us to issue shares for such amounts, which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nIf a holder elects to convert some or all of their Notes, if, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to a conversion date, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds the applicable conversion price on each such trading day, we will pay such holder an interest make-whole payment in cash or common stock for the Notes being converted. We have the option to issue our common stock to any\nconverting holder in lieu of making the interest make-whole payment in cash. If we elect to issue our common stock for such payment, then the stock will be valued at 95% of the simple average of the daily volume-weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of our common stock for the 10 trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date. Agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness may prohibit us from making cash payments in respect of the interest make-whole amount upon a conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the shares we deliver in connection with a conversion, including those delivered in connection with the interest make-whole amount and repayment of principal, exceed 221.7294 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment or, in aggregate, 19.96 million shares. If, pursuant to our election to deliver common stock in connection with the payment of the interest make-whole amount, we would be required to deliver a number of shares of common stock in excess of such threshold, we will deliver cash in lieu of any shares otherwise deliverable upon conversions in excess thereof (based on the simple average of the daily VWAP for the 10 trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date).\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the interest on our Notes, the principal amount of the Notes when due at maturity, redemption or otherwise, the amount of cash due upon conversion of the Notes, if relevant, or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its Notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness may contain limitations on our ability to pay certain of such cash obligations.\nOur Notes bear interest annually at a rate of 7.50% per year which interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1. In addition, in certain circumstances, we are obligated to pay additional interest on the Notes. At maturity or on the redemption date, if any, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and payable by us with respect to Notes that have not been previously converted or purchased by us. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, we may be required to repay the principal amount of Notes, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change purchase price. We at our election may elect to settle conversions of the Notes partially or entirely in cash.\nSuch payments could be significant, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, so that we can make such payments when due. The terms of the Indenture that govern the Notes may limit our ability to obtain such financing. In addition, the occurrence of a fundamental change may cause an event of default under agreements governing our or our existing or future subsidiaries' indebtedness. Agreements governing any future debt may also restrict our ability to make certain of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to satisfy such cash obligations may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to pay such cash obligations, we will be in default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our indebtedness, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to make such payments.\nThe fundamental change provisions of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of our Notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of our Notes.\nSales of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock which would impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities convertible into our common stock to fund acquisitions, finance operations or for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding 42,974,463 shares of common stock, of which approximately 15,346,863 shares are restricted securities that may be sold in accordance with the resale restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act or pursuant to a resale registration statement. Also, as of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding options to purchase 2,080,749 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 42,083 shares of common stock that, if exercised, would result in these additional shares becoming available for sale. A large portion of these shares, options and warrants are held by a small number of persons and investment funds. We have also registered all common stock subject to options outstanding or reserved for issuance under our 2005 Stock Plan, 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. An aggregate of 2,254,948 and 305,570 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, 5,108,212 shares of our common stock are presently reserved for future issuance upon conversion of the Notes. These shares will be eligible for resale in the public market upon issuance. Also, on December 17, 2014, the SEC declared effective our registration statement on Form S-3. Under the registration statement, we may offer and sell securities at a maximum aggregate offering price of up to $112.8 million. We also registered the resale of 12,749,328 shares of our common stock that may be sold by two selling security holders.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have very limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If securities or industry analysts presently covering our business do not continue such coverage or if additional securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our Company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with our directors and their affiliated entities and our executive officers will limit your ability to influence certain corporate matters.\nOur directors and their affiliated entities, and our executive officers beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 28.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders are collectively able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The concentration of ownership may delay, prevent or deter a change in control of our Company even when such a change may be in the best interests of some stockholders, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company or our assets and might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time. This staggered board structure prevents stockholders from replacing the entire board at a single stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022 Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n\u2022 Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock. The ability to authorize preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\n\u2022 Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. Furthermore, stockholders may only remove a member of our board of directors for cause. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect such acquiror's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\n\u2022 Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions outside of a stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022 Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to call a special meeting.\n\u2022 A supermajority (75%) of the voting power of outstanding shares of our capital stock is required to amend or repeal or to adopt any provision inconsistent with certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and to amend our by-laws, which make it more difficult to change the provisions described above.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential\nacquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors.\nWe may not be able to maintain an active public market for our common stock.\nThere was no public market for our common stock prior to the closing of our initial public offering in May 2012. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our common stock will allow us to maintain an active trading market on The NASDAQ Global Market or a similar market or how liquid that market might become. If an active public market is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to the investor, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products, product candidates or technologies by using our shares of common stock as consideration.\nTo the extent outstanding stock options or warrants are exercised, there will be dilution to new investors.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had options to purchase 2,080,749 shares of common stock outstanding, with exercise prices ranging from $0.40 to $12.92 per share and a weighted average exercise price of $7.93 per share. Upon the vesting of each of these options, the holder may exercise his or her options, which would result in dilution to investors. Dilution could also be experienced if we issue additional shares of common stock under the warrants that we issued to our lenders. As of December 31, 2014, the lender warrants to purchase 18,750 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00 per share and 23,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share remain outstanding.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile, in part because our common stock has been traded publicly for less than three years. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the commercial performance of Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, or any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval;\n\u2022 the filing of ANDAs by generic companies seeking approval to market generic versions of our products;\n\u2022 plans for, progress in and results from clinical trials of our product candidates generally;\n\u2022 FDA or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022 announcements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022 fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022 fluctuations in stock market prices for the U.S. stock market;\n\u2022 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022 litigation or public concern about the safety of our products and/or potential products;\n\u2022 actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022 changes in third-party coverage and reimbursement policies for our products and/or product candidates, and\n\u2022 discussion of us or our stock price in the financial or scientific press or in online investor communities.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in these \"Risk Factors\" could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention, which could hurt our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe number of shares of our common stock that may be issued upon conversion of the Notes may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs of March 11, 2014 the holders of $23.5 million of Notes have the right to convert the Notes into an aggregate of 4,424,717 shares of our common at any time. In addition, in certain instances we may issue additional shares of our common stock to holders who convert their Notes in order to satisfy our obligation to pay an interest make-whole payments to these note holders or who those holder that convert their Notes in connection with a transaction that constitutes a \"make-whole fundamental change\" under the Indenture governing the Notes. The possibility that we may issue a substantial number of shares of common stock to the holders of Notes in connection with conversions and thus substantially increase the number of issued shares of our common stock outstanding may have an adverse effect on our stock price for as long as the Notes remain outstanding.", "PERMNO": 13410, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SUPN"}
