{"cik": "1475115", "company": "Eventbrite, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur continued growth depends on our ability to attract new creators and retain existing creators.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new creators and retain existing creators. We may fail to attract new creators and retain existing creators due to a number of factors outlined in this section, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and continually enhance our platform and provide services that are valuable and helpful to creators, including helping them to attract and retain attendees;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors, including the actions of new and existing competitors in our industry, such as competitors buying exclusive ticketing rights or entering into or expanding within the market in which we operate;\n\u2022\nour ability to convince creators to migrate to our platform from their current practices, which include online ticketing platforms, venue box offices and do-it-yourself spreadsheets and forms;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationships with third parties, including our partners, developers and payment processors, that make our platform less effective for creators;\n\u2022\nthe quality and availability of key payment and payout methods;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage fraud risk that negatively impacts creators; and\n\u2022\nour ability to adapt to changes in market practices or economic incentives for creators, including larger or more frequent signing fees.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage these risks as they occur, creators may seek other solutions and we may not be able to retain them or acquire additional creators to offset any such departures, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, the loss of creators and our inability to replace them with new creators and events of comparable quality and standing would harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $64.1 million, $38.5 million and $40.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our net revenues were $291.6 million, $201.6 million and $133.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This represents a 44.7% growth rate from 2017 to 2018 and a 51.0% growth rate from 2016 to 2017. We expect that our revenue growth rate will decline or fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including a reduction in revenue contributed from acquisitions in a particular period. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend substantial financial resources on technology infrastructure, product and services development and enhancement, international expansion and localization efforts, business development and acquisitions, sales and marketing and general administration, including legal and accounting expenses. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we are unable to maintain adequate revenue growth and to manage our expenses effectively, we may incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. As a result, we may continue to generate losses and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to maintain profitability.\nFurther expansion into markets outside of the United States is important to the growth of our business, and if we do not manage the risks of international expansion effectively, our business and results of operations will be harmed. Furthermore, our expansion into jurisdictions where we have limited operating experience may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could harm our business and our results of operations.\nIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived 27.4%, 30.0% and 27.0%, respectively, of our net revenue from outside of the United States. Outside the U.S. we currently have 12 offices, including offices in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Argentina and Brazil. We have large engineering and business development teams in Argentina and Spain. Our international operations and results are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations and the risks and costs inherent in hedging such exposures;\n\u2022\nnew and modified laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection and information security;\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic or political instability, threatened or actual acts of terrorism and violence and changes in the rights of individuals to assemble;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and non-U.S. regulations, laws and requirements relating to anti-corruption, antitrust or competition, economic sanctions, data content and privacy, consumer protection, employment and labor laws, health and safety and advertising and promotions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally and interpretations of U.S. and international tax laws;\n\u2022\nweaker enforcement of our contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npreferences by local populations for local providers;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses; and\n\u2022\nslower adoption of the Internet as a ticketing, advertising and commerce medium, which could limit our ability to migrate international operations to our existing systems.\nWe plan to continue to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. Despite our experience operating internationally, future expansion efforts into new countries may not be successful. Our international expansion has placed, and our expected future international growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, customer service, product development, sales and marketing, administrative, financial and other resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in expanding our international operations will be successful or produce desired levels of revenue or profitability in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our margins as our revenue from these markets grows over time.\nWe may choose in certain instances to localize our platform to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets in order to achieve market acceptance, which can be complex, difficult and costly and divert management and personnel resources. Our failure to adapt our practices, platform, systems, processes and contracts effectively to the creator and attendee preferences or customs of each country into which we expand could slow our growth. If we are unable to manage our international growth successfully, our results of operations could be harmed.\nAcquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties.\nWe have acquired or entered into commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past. For example, since 2015 we have acquired seven companies, including ticketscript and Ticketfly in 2017 and Ticketea and Picatic in 2018. Our future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements, any of which could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Financial and operational risks related to acquisitions, investments and significant commercial arrangements that may have an impact on our business include:\n\u2022\nuse of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including for retirement of outstanding indebtedness, stock repurchases and dividend payments;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, data, technology, privacy, data protection systems and information security systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated benefits, revenue, earnings or cash flows or our failure to retain key employees from an acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown risks, debt and liabilities of the acquired company, deficiencies in systems or internal controls, impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and costs associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u2022\nfailure to properly and timely integrate acquired companies and their operations, reducing our ability to achieve, among other things, anticipated returns on our acquisitions through cost savings and other synergies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to acquisitions;\n\u2022\nfailure to consummate such transactions; and\n\u2022\nother expected and unexpected risks with pursuing acquisitions, including, but not limited to, litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits, costs or delays to obtain governmental approvals, diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business and other adverse effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWhen we acquire companies or other businesses, we face the risk that creators of the acquired companies or businesses may not migrate to our platform or may choose to decrease their level of usage of our platform post migration. We have previously experienced customer loss in the process of integrating and migrating acquired companies for a variety of reasons. The pace and success rate of migration may be influenced by many factors, including the pace and quality of product development, our ability to operationally support the migrating creators and our adoption of business practices outside of our platform that matter to the creator.\nMoreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by our acquired targets and their equity holders, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property, compliance with laws, contractual requirements and the ability of the acquisition target to continue exploiting material intellectual property rights and technology after the acquisition. If any such representations are inaccurate or such warranties are breached, or if we are unable to fully exercise our indemnification rights, we may incur additional liabilities, disruptions to the operations of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions, investments and significant commercial arrangements could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not continue to maintain and improve our platform or develop successful new solutions and enhancements or improve existing ones, our business will suffer.\nOur ability to attract and retain creators depends in large part on our ability to provide a user-friendly and effective platform, develop and improve our platform and introduce compelling new solutions and enhancements. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, new service and product introductions and changing demands of creators. We spend substantial time and resources understanding creators\u2019 needs and responding to them. Building new solutions is costly and complex, and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience. In addition, after development, creators may not be satisfied with our enhancements or perceive that the enhancements do not adequately respond to their needs. The success of any new solution or enhancement to our platform depends on several factors, including timely completion and delivery, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with our platform, creator awareness and overall market acceptance and adoption. If we do not continue to maintain and improve our platform or develop successful new solutions and enhancements or improve existing ones, our business will suffer.\nOur payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to risks that may harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party providers to support our payments system. Approximately 90% of revenue on our platform is associated with payments processed through our internal payment processing capabilities, called Eventbrite Payment Processing (EPP). EPP uses a combination of multiple external vendors to provide a single, seamless payments option for creators and attendees. Beyond EPP, the remainder of creators\u2019 paid ticket sales are processed through linked, creator-owned, third-party accounts, including PayPal and Authorize.net, which we call Facilitated Payment Processing (FPP).\nWe partner with third-party vendors to support EPP. For example, in September 2017, we announced a partnership with Square where Square would become our primary online payment processing partner for EPP in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom as well as any new territories Square enters into over-time. Square will also become our exclusive payment processing partner for all of our point-of-sale solutions in those same territories. We may supplement Square in these markets by working with other payment providers if there are local payment methods that Square does not support. We estimate that the first online transaction will be processed through EPP using Square in 2019. Our agreement with Square has an initial term of five years and automatically renews for additional one-year periods thereafter. Under the agreement, we will pay Square a percentage of each transaction processed using Square\u2019s services plus Square\u2019s third-party costs to process and settle such transactions. Either we or Square may terminate the partnership arrangement at any time for cause, or, after an initial no termination period of two years if terminated by Square or four years if terminated by us, for any or no reason with six months\u2019 prior written notice to the other party. Our costs for payment processing may increase using Square due to higher direct costs of development and implementation and fee structure. We also partner with other payment processors for EPP in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as in other jurisdictions.\nAs a complex, multi-vendor system with proprietary technology added, EPP relies on banks and third-party payment processors to process transactions and access various payment card networks to allow creators to manage payments in an easy and efficient manner. We also rely on our providers to process transactions as a payment facilitator of a payment network. Any of our payment providers and vendors that do not operate well with our platform could adversely affect our payments systems and our business. We have multiple integrations in place at one time allowing for back up processing on EPP if a single provider is unable or unwilling to process any given transaction, payment method or currency. However, if any or some of these providers do not perform adequately, determine certain types of transactions as prohibitive for any reason or fail to identify fraud, if these providers\u2019 technology does not interoperate well with our platform, or if our relationships with these providers were to terminate unexpectedly, creators may find our platform more difficult to use and the ability of creators using our platform to sell tickets could be adversely affected, which could cause creators to use our platform less and harm our business.\nWe must also continually integrate various payment methods used both within the United States and internationally into EPP. To enhance our acceptance in certain international markets we have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, locally-preferred payment methods and integrate such payment methods into EPP, which may increase our costs and also require us to understand and protect against unique fraud and other risks associated with these payment methods. For example, in Brazil we localized our platform to allow the use of Boleto as a payment method, and we invested capital and management attention to achieve this. If we are not able to integrate new payment methods into EPP effectively, our business may be harmed.\nOur payment processing partners require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some creators, be costly to implement or difficult to follow. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or creators using our platform violate these rules, such as our processing of various types of transactions that may be interpreted as a violation of certain payment card network operating rules.\nIn addition, payment card networks and payment processing partners could increase the fees they charge us for their services or for an attendee using one of their cards, which would increase our operating costs and reduce our margins. If we are unable to negotiate favorable economic terms with these partners, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may pay up front creator signing fees and creator advances to certain creators when entering into exclusive ticketing or services agreements and if these arrangements do not perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may pay one-time, up front non-recoupable or recoupable signing fees to certain creators in order to incentivize them to organize certain events on our platform or obtain exclusive rights to ticket their events. These payments are common practice in certain segments of the ticketing industry and are typically made to a creator upon entering into a multi-year exclusive ticketing or service contract with us. The multi-year exclusive arrangements that we entered into between 2013 and 2018 had an average term of 36 months and were typically for exclusive ticketing rights. A creator who receives a non-recoupable fee, which we refer to as creator signing fees, net, keeps the entire signing fee, so long as the creator complies with the terms of the creator\u2019s contract with us, including performance of an event. If a creator does not comply with the terms of the contract or perform an event, such fees are refundable to us. Creator signing fees, net, including noncurrent balances, were $17.0 million and $10.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2018, these payments are being amortized over a weighted-average remaining life of 3.3 years on a straight-line basis. For recoupable fees, which we refer to as creator advances, net, we are entitled to recoup the entire signing fee by withholding all or a portion of the ticket sales sold by the creator to whom the recoupable signing fee was previously paid. Creator advances, net, including noncurrent balances, were $23.1 million and $20.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We pay these signing fees based on the expectations of future ticket sales on our platform by such creators. We make the decision to make these payments based on our assessment of the past success of the creator, past event data, future events the creator is producing and other financial information. We include commercial and legal protections in our contracts that include signing fees, such as issuing the signing fee only after the creator begins selling tickets on our platform and requiring a third-party to guarantee the obligations and liabilities of the creator receiving such a payment, to mitigate the financial risk of making these payments. However, event performance may vary greatly from year-to-year and from event to event. If our assumptions and expectations with respect to event performance prove wrong or if a counterparty defaults or an event is not successful, our return on these signing fees will not be realized and our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur results vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our results of operations in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our results of operations in subsequent financial quarters or years.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past due to these factors and a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenue accurately. Because our results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years. Period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. In addition to other risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\ncreator acquisition and retention;\n\u2022\nnew solution introductions and expansions, or challenges with introduction;\n\u2022\nacquisition of companies and the success, or lack thereof, of migration of such companies\u2019 creators;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing or packages;\n\u2022\nthe development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n\u2022\nsystem failures or breaches of security or privacy;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock-based compensation expenses;\n\u2022\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy or data protection, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders or consent decrees;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate;\n\u2022\nannouncements by competitors or other third parties of significant new products or acquisitions or entrance into certain markets; our ability to make accurate accounting estimates and appropriately recognize revenue for our solutions for which there are no relevant comparable products;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; and\n\u2022\nchanges in business or macroeconomic conditions.\nIn addition, the seasonality of our business could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity, which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy, which in turn could harm our results of operations. For example, we experience more cash flow generally in the first and third quarters of a fiscal year.\nData loss or security breaches could harm our business, reputation, brand and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party service providers and partners are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, hacking and other means of unauthorized access, denial of service and other attacks, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. In addition to unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal data, confidential information, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and ransomware, and may use a variety of methods, including denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means, to attain such unauthorized access or acquisition or otherwise affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Furthermore, the prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents. In addition, misplaced, stolen or compromised mobile devices used at events for ticket scanning, or otherwise, could lead to unauthorized access to the device and data stored on or accessible through such device. We have in the past experienced breaches of our security measures and our platform and systems are at risk for future breaches as a result of third-party action or employee, service provider, partners or contractor error or malfeasance. For example, in June 2018, we publicly announced that a criminal was able to penetrate the Ticketfly website and steal certain consumer data, including names, email addresses, shipping addresses, billing addresses and phone numbers. For a short time, we disabled the Ticketfly platform to contain the risk of the cyber incident, which disabled ticket sales through Ticketfly during that period. Because of this incident, we have incurred costs related to responding to and remediating this incident and have suffered a loss of revenue for the period during which the Ticketfly platform was disabled. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $7.0 million for costs associated with this incident, of which $6.7 million was recorded as a reduction to net revenue and $0.3 million was recorded as an operating expense. We also recorded $6.6 million related to insurance proceeds to be received from the Ticketfly incident as a reduction in general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Such proceeds are a partial reimbursement for accommodations to creators which are recorded as contra revenue. As of December 31, 2018, we had a remaining liability balance of $0.3 million related to future accommodation payments and a $0.6 million receivable for insurance proceeds. The cyber incident has delayed the completion of the integration of Ticketfly, which has resulted in extended customer migration time and slower realization of synergies. We may be subject to litigation, experience reputational harm, and have been subject to claims and have suffered customer loss related to this incident. In the future, our financial performance may be impacted further if we face additional costs and expenses from customer compensation and retention incentives, creator loss, regulatory inquiries, litigation and further remediation and upgrades to our security infrastructure. Although we have insurance coverage, our policy may not cover all financial expenses related to this matter.\nIn addition, our platform involves the storage and transmission of personal information of users of our platform in our facilities and on our equipment, networks and corporate or third-party systems. Security breaches could expose us to litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. User data and corporate systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error or misconduct, malfeasance, a combination of these or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or data of creators and attendees. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, creators or attendees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to creator or attendee data. We must continuously examine and modify our security controls and business policies to address the use of new devices and technologies, and the increasing focus by users and regulators on controlling and protecting user data. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences. Any security breach of our platform or systems, the systems or networks of our third-party service providers or partners, or any unauthorized access to information we or our providers and partners process or maintain, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined or other future event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures or our third-party service providers and partners\u2019 information security measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or further security incidents. Although it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any actual or perceived failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure, or of any third-party networks or systems used or supplied by our third-party service providers or partners, to the satisfaction of creators and attendees may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing creators and attendees and attract new creators and attendees.\nExamples of situations which may lead to unauthorized access of data may include:\n\u2022\nemployees inadvertently sending financial information of one creator, attendee or employee to another creator, attendee or employee;\n\u2022\ncreators\u2019 failure to properly password protect their leased ticket scanning and site operations devices leaving the data available to anyone using the device;\n\u2022\na device stolen from an event and data access, alteration or acquisition occurring prior to our remote wiping of the data;\n\u2022\nan employee losing their computer or mobile device or otherwise, allowing for access to our email and/or administrative access, including access to guest lists to events;\n\u2022\nexternal breaches leading to the circulation of \u201cdark web\u201d lists of user name and password combinations openly vulnerable to attack without immediate detection;\n\u2022\na hack of one of our databases;\n\u2022\naccount takeovers;\n\u2022\na hack of a third-party service provider or partner\u2019s database; and\n\u2022\nunauthorized access to our offices or other properties.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose creators and attendees or we could face lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings and we could suffer financial exposure due to such events or in connection with regulatory fines, remediation efforts, investigation costs, changes or augmentation of our security measures and the expense of taking additional system protection measures.\nThe processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing applications of privacy regulations.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. Numerous federal, state and international laws address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data. Numerous states already have, and are looking to expand, data protection legislation requiring companies like ours to consider solutions to meet differing needs and expectations of creators and attendees. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect on January 1, 2020, and will broadly define personal information, give California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provide for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. Outside the United States, personally identifiable information and other user data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. Foreign data protection, privacy, information security, user protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. In particular, the European Union and its member states traditionally have taken broader views as to types of data that are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations, and have imposed greater legal obligations on companies in this regard. For example, in April 2016, European legislative bodies adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the European Union as well as to those outside the European Union if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the European Union or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe rely on a variety of legal bases to transfer certain personal information outside of the European Economic Area, including the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, and EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). Both the Privacy Shield and SCCs are the subject of legal challenges in European courts and may face additional challenges in the future, and the absence of successor legal bases for continued data transfer could require us to create duplicative, and potentially expensive, information technology infrastructure and business operations in Europe or limit our ability to collect and use personal information collected in Europe. In addition, the EU Commission is currently negotiating a new ePrivacy Regulation that would address various matters, including provisions specifically aimed at the use of cookies to identify an individual\u2019s online behavior, and any such ePrivacy Regulation may provide for new compliance obligations and significant penalties. Any of these changes to EU data protection law or its interpretation could disrupt and harm our business.\nFurther, following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the European Union, the United Kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the EU, which has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, although a Data Protection Bill designed to be consistent with the GDPR is pending in the United Kingdom\u2019s legislative process, it is unclear whether the United Kingdom will enact data protection laws or regulations designed to be consistent with the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\nThe interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are, and will likely remain, uncertain, and it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or product features. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, which could harm our business. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Any inability to adequately address privacy, data protection and data security concerns or comply with applicable privacy, data protection or data security laws, regulations, policies and other obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business\nOur acquisition strategy to date, and going forward, often results in the winding down of the acquired platforms over a period of 12 to 24 months while the existing creators migrate to our platform. The focus often shifts away from these legacy platforms to meeting the needs of migrated creators on our platform. The existence of these legacy platforms within a shifting landscape regarding privacy, data protection and data security may result in regulatory liability or exposure to fines. A significant data incident on a legacy platform may harm our reputation and our brand and may adversely affect the migration of existing creators to our platform. We may also become exposed to potential liabilities and our attention and resources may be diverted as a result of differing privacy regulations pertaining to our applications.\nOur failure, and/or the failure by the various third-party service providers and partners with which we do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data, or the perception that any such failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of creators or attendees, discourage potential creators and attendees from trying our platform and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or users, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, ongoing compliance with evolving interpretation of the GDPR and other regulatory requirements requires time and resources and a review of the technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR and other regulations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented. We compete against traditional solutions to event management and may face significant competition from both established and new companies. If we are not able to maintain or improve our competitive position, our business could suffer.\nWe operate in a market that is highly fragmented. We compete with a variety of competitors to secure new and retain existing creators, including traditional solutions to event management, such as offline, internal or ad hoc solutions, local or specialized market competitors, products offered by large technology companies that may enter the market, or other ticketing competitors such as Live Nation Entertainment subsidiaries Front Gate Tickets, TicketWeb and Universe. If we cannot successfully compete in the future with existing or potential competitors this will cause an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources, are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their services, have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships, have longer operating histories and greater name recognition. We may also compete with potential entrants into the market that currently do not offer the same services but could potentially leverage their networks in the market in which we operate. For instance, large e-commerce companies such as eBay and Amazon have in the past, or currently, operate within the ticketing space. In addition, other large companies with large user-bases that have substantial event-related activity may be successful in adding a product in this space, such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. These competitors may be better able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and/or offer their solutions and services at a discount to ours. Furthermore, some of our competitors may customize their products to suit a specific event type, category or customer. We also compete with self-service products that provide creators with alternatives to ticket their events by integrating such self-service products with creators\u2019 existing operations. If we are unable to compete with such alternatives, the demand for our solutions could decline.\nIf any of our competitors have existing relationships with potential creators or the venues or facilities used by those creators, those creators may be unwilling or unable to use our platform and this may limit our ability to successfully compete in certain markets where such pre-existing relationships are common. For example, some competitors purchase venues or rights to events and/or enter into exclusivity agreements with creators. If creators do not remain independent from our potential competitors, demand for our platform will diminish and our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur business may be subject to sales tax and other indirect taxes in various jurisdictions. In addition, creators may also be subject to certain taxes.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, amusement tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours and to creators and attendees is a complex and evolving issue. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to creators\u2019 businesses.\nOne or more states, localities, the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate, collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. Certain jurisdictions have enacted laws which became effective in 2018 or will become effective later requiring marketplaces to report user activity or collect and remit taxes on certain items sold on the marketplace. Imposition of an information reporting or tax collection requirement could decrease creator or attendee activity on our platform, which would harm our business. New legislation could require us or creators to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection and remittance and audit requirements, which could make using our platform less attractive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face sales and use tax and value-added tax audits in certain states and international jurisdictions and it is possible that we could face additional sales and use tax and value-added tax audits in the future in additional jurisdictions and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our reserves as state or international tax authorities could assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from creators and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits and assessments with respect to states and international jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for sales or other taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage creators from using our platform or otherwise harm our business and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements as disclosed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition will be harmed.\nThe reputation and brand of our platform is important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand as a differentiated and category-defining ticketing company serving creators and attendees is critical to our relationship with our existing creators and to our ability to attract new creators and attendees. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors that we control and some factors outside of our control.\nThe promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures and management investment, which will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we seek to expand our platform. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand and successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services, our business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose creators or fail to attract potential creators, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we must continue to make substantial efforts and investments to be associated with events that are positively viewed by other creators and attendees.\nHowever, there are also factors outside of our control, which could undermine our reputation and harm our brand. Negative perception of our platform may harm our business, including as a result of complaints or negative publicity about us or creators; events being fraudulent or unsuccessful, either as a result of lack of attendance or attendee experience not meeting expectations; responsiveness to issues or complaints and timing of refunds and/or chargebacks; actual or perceived disruptions or defects in our platform; security incidents; or lack of awareness of our policies or changes to our policies that creators, attendees or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear or inconsistent with our values.\nFurthermore, creators use our platform for events that represent a variety of views, activities and interests, some of which many other creators or attendees do not agree with or find offensive, or are illegal, or are perceived as such. For example, in the past, creators have tried to use our platform for events related to illegal activity and extreme activist groups. These events may cause negative publicity and harm our reputation and brand. Some creators may not have, or are perceived not to have, legal and ethical business practices. Although we maintain procedures and policies, both automated and by human review, to prevent the usage of our platform for such purposes and to prevent such practices, our procedures and policies may not effectively reduce or eliminate the use of our platform by such creators. In addition, certain creators or attendees may not agree with our decision to restrict certain creators or events from using our platform. If our platform is associated with illegal or offensive activity or creators and attendees disagree with our decision to restrict certain creators or events from using our platform, our reputation and brand may be harmed and our ability to attract and retain creators will be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to maintain a reputable platform that provides valuable solutions and desirable events, then our ability to attract and retain creators and attendees could be impaired and our reputation, brand and business could be harmed.\nOur platform might be used for illegal or improper purposes, all of which could expose us to additional liability and harm our business.\nOur platform remains susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses by creators or attendees. Illegal or improper uses of our platform may include money laundering, terrorist financing, drug trafficking, illegal online gaming, other online scams, illegal sexually-oriented services, phishing and identity theft, prohibited sales of pharmaceuticals, fraudulent sale of goods or services, posting of unauthorized intellectual property, unauthorized uses of credit and debit cards or bank accounts and similar misconduct. Creators may also encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activities. Despite measures we have taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, we cannot guarantee that these measures will stop all illegal or improper uses of our platform. Our business could be harmed if creators use our system for illegal or improper purposes, which may expose us to liability. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these activities are too restrictive and inadvertently screen proper transactions, or if we are unable to apply and communicate these measures fairly and transparently, or we are perceived to have failed to do so, this could diminish the experience of creators and attendees, which could harm our business.\nFactors adversely affecting the live event market could impact our results of operations.\nWe help creators organize, promote and sell tickets and registrations to a broad range of events. Our business is directly affected by the success of such events and our revenue is impacted by the number of events, type of events and ticket prices of events produced by creators. Adverse trends in one or more event industries could adversely affect our business. A decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income.\nDuring periods of economic slowdown and recession, consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending. The impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in ticket and registration sales and our ability to generate revenue. Our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. Many factors related to discretionary consumer and corporate spending, including employment, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation can adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents, public health concerns, natural disasters or similar events, or loss or restriction of individuals\u2019 rights to assemble may deter creators from producing large events and substantially decrease the attendance at live events. For example, in January 2017, five people were killed at a music festival in Mexico ticketed by us. Terrorism and security incidents, military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have increased public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and national or local catastrophic incidents. These concerns have led to numerous challenging operating factors at live events, including additional logistics for event safety and increased costs of security. These challenges may impact the creator and attendee experience, lead to fewer events by creators and as a result may harm our results of operations.\nFurthermore, adverse weather and climate conditions could impact the success of an event and disrupt our operations in any of our offices or the operations of creators, third-party providers, vendors or partners. If an event is cancelled due to weather, attendees expect a refund, which harms our results of operations and those of creators.\nAccordingly, any adverse condition could lead to unsatisfied attendees that require refunds or chargebacks or increase the complexity and costs for creators and us, which will have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant system interruption or delays could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of creators and adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to attract and retain creators depends on the reliable performance of our technology, including our websites, applications and information and related systems. System interruptions, slow-downs and a lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to operate our technology, handle sales for high-demand events, process and fulfill transactions, respond to creator and attendee inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations.\nWe also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems and infrastructures, our businesses, our affiliates and/or third-party systems we use, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures, could impair our ability to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, occasional system interruptions caused by outages by our partners that made some or all systems or data unavailable or prevented us from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders.\nWe outsource our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which hosts our platform, and therefore we are vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS, which could impact the ability of creators and attendees to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. Our customer agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the agreement by providing 30 days prior written notice and may, in some cases, terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon notice. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of Internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services. For example, we previously experienced interruptions in performance of our platform because of a hardware error that AWS experienced. We may also incur significant costs for using an alternative cloud infrastructure provider or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the AWS services we use.\nIn addition, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. Any of these events could cause system interruptions, outages, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nIn some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to creators. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during peak usage times, as the features of our platform become more complex and the usage of our platform increases. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause creators to stop using our platform, impair our ability to increase revenue, impair our ability to grow our business, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur platform and solutions are accessed by a large number of creators and attendees often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of creators and attendees and solutions available to creators and attendees, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. Furthermore, capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, the failure of AWS cloud infrastructure or other third-party Internet service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to scale our operations. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCreators rely on third-party platforms, such as Facebook and Spotify, to connect with and attract attendees and we depend on our platform of partners and developers to create applications that will integrate with our platform.\nOur platform interoperates with other third-party distributors, such as Facebook and Spotify. Attendees are able to access our platform and purchase tickets through these third-party services. Creators are able to publicize their events and sell tickets on these third-party sites. The interoperability of our platform with these other sites allows creators to reach more attendees and makes our platform more appealing to creators. These third-party partners may terminate their relationship with us, limit certain integration functionality, change their treatment of our services or restrict access to their platform by creators at any time. For example, in the past, Facebook removed a feature of its service that allowed creators to include multiple hosts on a single event seamlessly across platforms, which negatively impacted certain music creators\u2019 use of the Facebook integration with our platform. If any such third-party services becomes incompatible with our platform or the use of our platform and solutions on such third-party platforms are restricted in the future, our business will be harmed.\nIn addition, to the extent that Google, Facebook or other leading large technology companies that have a significant presence in our key markets, disintermediate ticketing or event management providers, whether by offering their own comprehensive event-focused or shopping capabilities, or by referring leads to suppliers, other favored partners or themselves directly, there could be an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also depend on our platform of integrated product partners connecting through our API to create applications that will integrate with our platform, such as Salesforce, HubSpot and MailChimp, and to allow them to integrate with our solutions. This presents certain risks to our business, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to provide any assurance that these third-party applications and products meet the same quality and security standards that we apply to our own development efforts, and to the extent that they contain bugs or defects, they may create disruptions in the use of our platform by creators or negatively affect our brand;\n\u2022\nour lack of support for software applications developed by our partner platform, which could cause creators and attendees to be left without support and consequently could cease using our services if these developers do not provide adequate support for their applications;\n\u2022\nour inability to assure that our partners will be able to successfully integrate with our products or that our partners will continue to do so;\n\u2022\nour inability to confirm if our partners comply with all applicable laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that these partners and developers may not possess the appropriate intellectual property rights to develop and share their applications.\nMany of these risks are not within our control to prevent, and our brand may be damaged if these applications do not perform to the satisfaction of creators and attendees and that dissatisfaction is attributed to us.\nChanges in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation, or changes in marketplace rules could have a negative impact on traffic for our sites and ultimately, our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on Internet search engines, such as Google, to generate traffic to our website, principally through free or organic search. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our websites to place lower in organic search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of our websites or those of our partners, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected. Furthermore, our failure to successfully manage our search engine optimization could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic.\nWe also rely on application marketplaces, such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, to drive downloads of our applications. In the future, Apple, Google or other marketplace operators may make changes to their marketplaces that make access to our products more difficult. For example, our applications may receive unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order in which they appear within marketplaces. Similarly, if problems arise in our relationships with providers of application marketplaces, traffic to our site and our user growth could be harmed.\nOur business may be subject to chargebacks and other losses for various reasons, including due to fraud, unsuccessful or cancelled events. These chargebacks and other losses may harm our results of operations and business.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, claims from attendees that creators have not performed their obligations or that events did not match their descriptions. These claims could arise from creator fraud or misuse, an unintentional failure of the event or from fraudulent claims by an attendee. We have experienced fraudulent activity on our platform in the past, including fake events in which a person sells tickets to an event but does not intend to hold an event or fulfill the ticket, email spam being sent through our platform, a third party taking over the account of a creator to receive payments owed to such creator or orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data and other erroneous transmissions. Although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity on our platform, those measures may not always be effective. These measures must be continually improved and may not be effective against evolving methods of fraud or in connection with new platform offerings. If we cannot adequately control the risk of fraudulent activity on our platform, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also may experience chargebacks and losses as a result of advance payment of ticket fees to creators. Under our standard terms for creators using EPP, Eventbrite passes the creator\u2019s share of ticket sales to the creator within five business days after the successful completion of the creator\u2019s event. However, we face growing pressure from creators to advance some or most of their event funds prior to completion of their events because creators need these funds to pay for event related costs such as the venue, marketing, talent and vendors. For qualified creators who apply for such advance payments, we pass proceeds from ticket sales to the creators prior to the event as we receive the ticket proceeds, subject to certain limitations. We refer to these payments as advance payouts. In 2018, approximately 15.3% of creators received advance payouts. When we advance funds, we assume some risk that the event may be cancelled, fraudulent, materially not as described or removed from our platform due to its failure to comply with our terms of service or merchant agreement or the event has significant chargebacks, refund requests and/or disputes. The terms of our standard merchant agreement obligates creators to repay us for ticket sales advanced under such circumstances. However, we may not be able to recover our losses from these events and such unrecoverable amounts could equal up to the value of the transaction or transactions passed to the creator prior to the event that is disputed. This amount could be many multiples of the fees we collect from such transaction. In the case of failure of an entire event or series of events, the volume of transactions charged back or disputed could have an adverse impact on our financial position. We have established processes and risk mitigation measures around these advance payouts. However, these advance payments pose a challenging financial risk, and our standard fraud and risk controls may be ineffective in addressing this risk. Furthermore, we must also strike a balance between these protective measures and the needs of creators for access to ticket sales through a convenient and easy process, which many of our competitors provide. If these measures do not succeed, or if we fail to strike the right balance between protective measures and creator needs, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nThe total write-off from all lost advance payouts and other chargebacks was $6.1 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our failure to manage the risk of advance payouts to creators and to mitigate chargebacks and disputes due to fraud of a creator or otherwise or to recover the resulting losses from creators could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and the failure to retain, motivate or integrate any of these individual could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our founders and senior management team and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Each of our founders, executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any of our founders or any other member of our senior management team or key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could harm our business and our relationships. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Furthermore, several members of our management team were hired recently. If we are not able to integrate these new team members or if they do not perform adequately, our business may be harmed.\nWe face significant competition for personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. We may also need to increase our employee compensation levels in response to competition. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, including our recently hired management team members, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which may harm our business.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, which could harm our business.\nWe believe that our corporate culture has been an important contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork and passion for creators. Most of our employees have been with us for fewer than two years as a result of our rapid growth. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a growing number of new employees. As a result, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, maintain our performance or execute on our business strategy.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational change, such as additional controls and procedures and new functional groups within our company, through organic growth or as the result of integrating acquired companies. For example, the number of Eventbrite employees has increased from 855 on December 31, 2017 to 1,094 on December 31, 2018 and we expect to add more employees in the future. This growth and these changes have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we build the proper level of operational, financial and management controls and develop our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas and integrate acquired companies. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and changes and integrate acquired companies in a manner that preserves rapid innovation, attention to creator satisfaction and overall culture, the quality of our platform and our reputation may suffer, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract creators and impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur rapid growth makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not continue to grow at or near historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and as a result, our ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, our growth rates may slow and our business would suffer.\nOur pricing package options were recently launched and may affect our ability to attract or retain creators.\nIn the past, we have adjusted our prices either for individual creators in connection with long-term agreements or for new markets. In September 2017, we launched new pricing package options for creators based on the features required, service level desired and budget and we periodically adjusted the price of our packages. While we determined these prices and packages based on prior experience and feedback from creators, our assessments may not be accurate and we could be underpricing or overpricing our services, which may require us to continue to adjust our pricing packages. Furthermore, creators\u2019 price sensitivity may vary by location, and as we expand into different countries, our pricing packages may not enable us to compete effectively in these countries. In addition, if our platform or services change, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. Such changes to our pricing model or our ability to efficiently price our packages and solution could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition and impact our ability to predict our future performance.\nIf we cannot attract and retain attendees, our business will be harmed.\nIn order to continue to support creators, we need to continue to provide a compelling platform for creators to attract and retain attendees. Several factors may impact an attendee\u2019s experience with our platform, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to provide an easy solution for attendees to buy tickets or register for an event;\n\u2022\noutages or delays in our platform and other services, including delays in getting into events;\n\u2022\ncompatibility with other third-party services, such as Facebook and Spotify, and our ability to connect with other applications through our API;\n\u2022\nfraudulent or unsuccessful events that may result in a bad experience for attendees;\n\u2022\nbreaches and other security incidents that could compromise the data of attendees; and\n\u2022\nquality of our customer service and our ability to respond to complaints and other issues in a timely and effective manner.\nIf attendees become dissatisfied with their experiences on our platform or at an event, they make request refunds, provide negative reviews of our platform or decide not to attend future events on our platform, all of which would harm our business and reputation.\nA significant number of our employees are located in Argentina and any favorable or unfavorable developments in Argentina could have an impact on our results of operations.\nA significant number of our employees, including engineering and sales and marketing employees, are located in Argentina, and therefore, a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in Argentine pesos. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 158 employees located in Argentina, of which 93 are engineers. If the peso strengthens against the U.S. dollar, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations as it would increase our operating expenses. Our business activities in Argentina also subject us to risks associated with changes in and interpretations of Argentine law, including laws related to employment, the protection and ownership of intellectual property and U.S. ownership of Argentine operations. Furthermore, if we had to scale down or close our Argentine operations, there would be significant time and cost required to relocate those operations elsewhere, which could have an adverse impact on our overall cost structure.\nThe Argentine government has historically exercised significant influence over the country\u2019s economy. Additionally, the country\u2019s legal and regulatory frameworks have at times suffered radical changes, due to significant political influence and uncertainties. In the past, government policies in Argentina included expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors\u2019 rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely affect our business and operating expenses.\nIn addition, Argentina has experienced labor unrest over wages and benefits paid to workers. In the past, the Argentine government has passed laws, regulations, and decrees requiring companies in the private sector to maintain minimum wage levels and provide specified benefits to employees and may do so again in the future. Employers have also experienced significant pressure from their employees and labor organizations to increase wages and to provide additional employee benefits. Any disruptions, labor unrest, or increased personnel-related expenses in Argentina could have an adverse effect on our business and operating expenses.\nOur metrics and estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.\nWe regularly review metrics to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third party. Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. Furthermore, if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, we may not be able to accurately assess the health of our business and our reputation and our business may be harmed.\nCreator and attendee growth and retention depend upon effective interoperation with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards that we do not control.\nWe make our platform available across a variety of operating systems and web browsers. We are dependent on the interoperability of our platform with popular devices, mobile operating systems and web browsers that we do not control, such as Android, iOS, Chrome and Firefox. Any changes, bugs or technical issues in such systems, devices or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our platform, make it difficult for creators or attendees to access or use our platform, impose fees related to our platform or give preferential treatment to competitive products or services could adversely affect usage of our platform. In the event that it is difficult for creators or attendees to access and use our platform, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur failure to successfully address the evolving market for transactions on mobile devices and to build mobile products could harm our business.\nA significant and growing portion of creators and attendees access our platform through mobile devices. The number of people who access the Internet and purchase goods and services through mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or computers, has increased significantly in the past few years and is expected to continue to increase. If we are not able to provide creators and attendees with the experience and solutions they want on mobile devices, our business may be harmed.\nWhile we have created mobile applications and versions of much of our web content, if these mobile applications and versions are not well received by creators and attendees, our business may suffer. In addition, we face different fraud risks and regulatory risks from transactions sent from mobile devices than we do from personal computers. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and manage these risks, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been used in a production environment to deliver products and services. Any real or perceived errors, failures, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, loss of creators and attendees, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position, loss of revenue or liability for damages, overpayments and/or underpayments, any of which could harm the confidence of creators and attendees on our platform, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In such an event, we may be required or may choose to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Since creators use our platform for processes that are critical to their businesses, errors, failures or bugs in our code could result in creators seeking significant compensation from us for any losses they suffer and/or ceasing conducting business with us altogether. There can be no assurance that provisions typically included in our agreements with creators that attempt to limit our exposure to claims would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Even if unsuccessful, a claim brought against us by any creators would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend and could seriously damage our reputation and brand.\nWe rely on software and services licensed from other parties. Defects in or the loss of software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our service.\nComponents of our platform include various types of software and services licensed from unaffiliated third parties. Our business would be disrupted if any of the software or services we license from others or functional equivalents thereof were either no longer available to us or no longer offered on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required to either redesign our platform to function with software or services available from other parties or develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in the release of new solutions and services on our platform. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our platform due to changes by our third-party software and service providers. In addition, if we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these software or service licenses, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to license and integrate functional equivalents.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our platform. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. While we take precautions, it may still be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use our proprietary information to create solutions and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our technology and proprietary information may increase.\nWe enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform or solutions.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform or solutions, impair the functionality of our platform or solutions, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or solutions, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new features in our platform or solutions, and we cannot assure you that we could license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe use open source software in our platform, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our platform and may use more open source software in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our platform, discontinue the sale of our platform or take other remedial actions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software.\nOur business is subject to various import and export regulations. Our failure to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business.\nEconomic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, and dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, and other sanctioned persons, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase, perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in the limitation, suspension or termination of our platform, imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, and/or the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets. While we have policies and procedures for compliance with these economic sanctions regulations, given the technical limitations in developing measures that will prevent access to Internet-based services from particular geographies or by particular individuals, and additional factors, such as the ability of users to place on our platform false or deliberately misleading information, we believe that we may have provided services in connection with events that were located in a country subject to an embargo by the United States that may not have been in compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. We have previously identified and expect we will continue to identify customer accounts for our platform and services that may originate from or are intended to benefit, persons in countries that are subject to U.S. embargoes including events in or relating to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and the Crimea region of Ukraine.\nOn June 11, 2018, we submitted to OFAC an initial voluntary self-disclosure, and on July 17, 2018, a final report regarding the discovery of potentially unauthorized uses of our services by persons and in countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions. We will continue to work to remediate gaps in our compliance policies and procedures, potentially in ways that may be time-consuming or result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or impose other costs. Additionally, we cannot guarantee these measures will be fully effective in deterring unlawful activity on our platform. OFAC may conduct its own investigation of these events to determine whether to assess fines and penalties. We cannot predict when OFAC will complete its review and determine whether any violations occurred or levy penalties, including potential penalties against us for facilitating unlawful activity. Each instance in which we provide services through our platform may constitute a separate violation of these laws.\nFurther, our products incorporate encryption technology. These encryption products may be exported from the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. Such products may also be subject to certain regulatory reporting requirements. Various countries also regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers\u2019 ability to import our services into those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and of exports and imports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our products and services, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the provision of our products and services, including with respect to new products and services, may delay the introduction of our products and services in various markets or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our products and services to some countries altogether.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. For example, our platform is subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little notice. Changes in laws and regulations could impose more stringent requirements on us to detect and prevent illegal and improper activity by creators, which can increase our operating costs and reduce our margins. For example, to date, platforms like ours are immune from liability resulting from the improper or illegal actions facilitated by the platform, but initiated by its users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). If the CDA is amended in a manner that reduces protections for our platform, we will need to increase our content moderation operations, which may harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, the ticketing business is subject to many laws and regulations, both foreign and domestic. These laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may sometimes conflict. Outside of ticketing regulations, creators are often subject to regulations of their own, such as permitting and crowd control requirements. Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that creators comply with these laws and regulations, which could greatly increase our compliance costs, expose us to litigation, subject us to fines and penalties and otherwise harm our business.\nFailure to comply with economic sanctions and anti-bribery, anti-corruption and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act), and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in various jurisdictions, both domestic and abroad, where we conduct activities or have users. Our sales team sells use of our platform abroad, and we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their agents and third-party business parties and intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, service providers and agents, even if we do not authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot ensure that all of our employees, users and agents, as well as those contractors to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies or agreements and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nFurther, as noted above, we believe it may have been used for events located in countries subject to an embargo by the United States in potential violation of the economic sanctions regulations and has filed an initial voluntary self-disclosure with OFAC. We are conducting an internal review and will then submit a final voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and economic sanctions laws could result in various actions, including whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations and actions by federal or state attorneys general or foreign regulators, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil fines and penalties or other sanctions, forfeiture of significant assets, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and prospects. Responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Civil penalties for violations of the economic sanctions regulations may include monetary penalties of up to approximately $295,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per violation as well as criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations. A filing of a voluntary self-disclosure mitigates any potential civil penalties. At this time, we cannot determine if OFAC would impose any penalties against us or individuals for the potential violations and if any such penalties would be material to us.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations could harm our business and result of operations.\nDue to the risk of our platform being used for illegal or illicit activity, any perceived or actual breach of compliance by us with respect to anti-money laundering (AML) laws, rules, and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act and Title 18 U.S.C. Sections 1956-57 and 1960, could have a significant impact on our reputation and could cause us to lose existing creators and attendees, prevent us from obtaining new creators, require us to expend significant funds to remedy civil and criminal problems caused by violations and to avert further violations and expose us to legal risk and potential liability that could have a material effect on our business. Several of these laws require certain companies to adopt an AML compliance program, including those companies that are characterized as a money services business or money transmitter. Moreover, many states have their own AML legal regulatory regimes and interpretations and applications of those legal principles are complex and varied. If the federal government or any state government took the position that we were a money services business or money transmitter, they could require us to register as such and obtain a money transmitter license.\nWhile we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter, we have voluntarily elected to adopt an AML compliance program to mitigate the risk of our platform being used for illegal or illicit activity and to help detect and prevent fraud. Our AML compliance program is designed to foster trust in our platform and services connecting event creators and event attendees and also may mitigate our legal exposure should any federal or state regulator challenge our determination that we are not a money services business or money transmitter. Should a federal or state regulator make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter, we could be subject to civil and criminal fines, penalties, costs, legal fees, reputational damage or other negative consequences, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, finances, and operations.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations related to payments could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations related to payments are complex and vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. Furthermore, changes in laws, rules and regulations have occurred and may occur in the future, which may impact our business practices. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations and to ensure that creators and attendees are complying with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply or any failure by our third-party service providers and partners to comply with such laws and regulations or other requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), could divert substantial resources, result in liabilities or force us to stop offering EPP, which will harm our business and results of operations.\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may have a more expansive view of money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and as we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, if we experience substantial losses related to payment card transactions or in the event of noncompliance with the PCI-DSS, we may choose to, or be required to, cease accepting certain payment cards for payment. If we were unable to accept payment cards through EPP, creators would be required to use third-party payment options, which would reduce the simplicity and ease-of-use of our platform.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims and harm to our business based on the nature of the events business.\nWe face potential liability and expenses for legal claims relating to the events business, including potential claims related to event injuries allegedly caused by us, creators, service providers, partners or unrelated third parties. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to occurrences at an event, including deaths. Even if our personnel are not involved in these occurrences, we may face legal claims and still incur substantial expenses to resolve such claims. Further, Eventbrite may provide guidance or onsite personnel for event safety. In such instances, if an injury occurs at an event, we may face legal claims or additional liability for providing such services.\nUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation, claims, investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings, whether civil or criminal, or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties. If the results of these legal proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third-party lawsuits, we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other censure that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or counterclaim, we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or a claim that results in a significant damage award.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends on our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities, including non-practicing entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property rights relating to our industry and may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, have claimed and may in the future claim that our products or technologies may infringe their intellectual property rights and may assert patent, copyright, trade secret and other claims based on intellectual property rights against us and our customers, suppliers and channel partners. For example, in February 2013, a non-practicing entity named Eventbrite as a defendant in a multi-defendant patent infringement claim. A claim may also be made relating to technology or intellectual property rights that we acquire or license from third parties. If we were subject to a claim of infringement, regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses, the claim could:\n\u2022\nrequire costly litigation to resolve and the payment of substantial damages;\n\u2022\nrequire significant management time;\n\u2022\ncause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements;\n\u2022\nrequire us to discontinue the sale of products and solutions through our platform;\n\u2022\nrequire us to indemnify creators or third-party service providers or partners; and/or\n\u2022\nrequire us to expend additional development resources to redesign our platform.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations expose us to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our international locations in the local currency, and accept payment in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to potential adverse tax consequences and additional taxes.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Because of these international operations, we may be subject to adverse tax changes or interpretation, increased taxes due to increased international expansion, and tax charges due to complex intercompany agreements.\nWe may be subject to income taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us, any of which could have a negative impact on us or our results of operations. As we earn an increasing portion of our revenue, and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow, in foreign jurisdictions, we could face a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments.\nAdditionally, our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates and reduced cash flows and may harm our results of operations and financial condition. We believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $140.6 million and $49.6 million, respectively, which may be available to offset tax income in the future. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have undergone ownership changes in the past, which have resulted in minor limitations on our ability to utilize our NOLs, and future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. The existing NOLs of some of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations arising from ownership changes prior to, or in connection with, their acquisition by us. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize some portion of our NOLs, none of which are currently reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly reforms the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates and the rules governing net operating loss carryforwards. For NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits a taxpayer\u2019s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to 80% of taxable income (as calculated before taking the NOL carryforwards into account). In addition, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is generally prohibited. NOLs generated in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 will not be subject to the taxable income limitation, and NOLs generated in tax years ending before January 1, 2018 will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. As we maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. NOLs, these changes will not impact our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. However, in future years, at the time a deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\nWe have incurred indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs, to protect and enforce our intellectual property and to meet other needs.\nIn September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent (in such capacity, Administrative Agent). The Credit Agreement provides for (i) the New Term Loans in the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million and (ii) the New Revolving Credit Facility in aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. The New Revolving Credit Facility includes a $10.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit. The full amount of the New Term Loans was drawn on September 27, 2018 (Closing Date). As of December 31, 2018, we had $73.6 million of principal indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The New Term Loans and the New Revolving Credit Facility will each mature on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries (Guarantors). Obligations under the New Credit Facilities are secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the our and each of the Guarantor\u2019s current and future assets, including a pledge of the capital stock of subsidiaries held by us or the Guarantors (which pledge, in the case of any foreign subsidiary, is limited to 65% of the voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting stock of such foreign subsidiary).\nThe Credit Agreement contains, and any additional debt financing we may incur would likely contain, covenants requiring us to maintain or adhere to certain covenants that restrict our operations, which include limitations on our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; create liens on property; engage in mergers, consolidations and other fundamental changes; dispose of assets; make investments, loans or advances; make certain acquisitions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; declare or pay dividends on, or repurchase, our stock; and change our lines of business or fiscal year.\nComplying with these covenants could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. In addition, these covenants could affect our ability to invest capital in new businesses and fund capital expenditures for existing businesses. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions in our Credit Agreement and any future credit facilities or debt instruments may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control. A failure by us to comply with the restrictive covenants and any financial ratios contained in our Credit Agreement and any future credit facilities or debt instruments could result in an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in our Credit Agreement and any future credit facilities or debt instruments. In addition, if we are in default, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts under any such facilities to the extent that they would otherwise be available and our ability to obtain future financing may also be impacted negatively. If the indebtedness under our Credit Agreement and any future credit facilities or debt instruments were to be accelerated, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions, or agree to other restrictive covenants. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, if at all, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop and enhance our platform and solutions;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our technology development, sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or\n\u2022\npursue acquisition opportunities.\nIn addition, access to our existing lines of credit under the Credit Agreement are subject to certain financial and other covenants. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We are continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting from our international expansion. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business future prospects and increases the risk of your investment.\nWe launched operations in 2006. This limited history in an evolving industry makes it difficult to effectively assess or forecast our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter or may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to cost-effectively acquire new creators and engage and retain existing creators, maintain the quality of our technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle ticket sales and event management services globally and the deployment of new features and solutions and successfully compete with other companies that are currently in, or may enter, the ticketing and event solution space. Additional risks include our ability to effectively manage growth, responsibly use the data that creators and attendees share with us, process, store, protect and use personal data in compliance with governmental regulation, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security and avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service or slower than expected load times for our platform. Other risks posed by our limited operating history include the ability to hire, integrate and retain world class talent at all levels of the company, continue to expand our business in markets outside the United States, and defend ourselves against litigation, regulatory, intellectual property, privacy or other claims. If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above, our business and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nPrior to our initial public offering, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. The market prices of the securities of other newly public companies have historically been highly volatile. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets and/or publicly-listed technology companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our net revenue or other operating metrics;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business.\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our net revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated net revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our directors, executive officers and their affiliates and that may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January 31, 2019, our directors, executive officers and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding shares, and their affiliates, beneficially own in the aggregate 48.4% of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until September 20, 2028, the date that is the ten year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term.\nIn addition, in July 2017, Standard & Poor\u2019s announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including:\n\u2022\nnot being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and annual report on Form 10-K; and\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nOur status as an emerging growth company will end as soon as any of the following takes place:\n\u2022\nthe last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue;\n\u2022\nthe date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates;\n\u2022\nthe date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or\n\u2022\nthe last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on the exemptions afforded to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive because we reply on any of these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and the market price of our Class A common stock may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research on our company, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us on a regular basis, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, such as when our lock-up restrictions are released, or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Substantially all of our securities that were outstanding prior to the completion of our initial public offering are currently restricted from resale as a result of lock-up and market standoff agreements. These securities will become available to be sold 180 days after the date of the Prospectus. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may, in their discretion, permit our security holders to sell shares prior to the expiration of the restrictive provisions contained in the lock-up agreements. Sales of a substantial number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up and market standoff agreements, the perception that such sales may occur or early release of these agreements could cause our market price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. Shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates will also be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and various vesting agreements.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had 22,012,597 options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of shares of Class B common stock. All of the shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans are registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to existing lock-up or market standoff agreements, volume limitations under Rule 144 for our executive officers and directors and applicable vesting requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the holders of 42,188,624 shares of our Class B common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. Any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or be volatile.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of the NYSE and other applicable securities rules and regulations. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have already hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in an increased risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe individuals who now constitute our senior management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our senior management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, the ability of Class A common stockholders to achieve a return on investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, Class A common stockholders may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the market price of our Class A common stock increases.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions that will be in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\nprovide that only the Chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision which will be contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18063, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EB"}
