We have described below significant factors that may adversely affect us and our industry. You should carefully consider these factors, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the SEC, before making any investment decision about our securities.\nThe Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe, or at all. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including (i) the receipt of all consents, approvals or authorizations of, declarations or filings under applicable competition laws and foreign investment laws; (ii) the absence of certain legal impediments preventing the completion of the Merger; and (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties and the compliance by the parties with their respective covenants in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or waived, or the conditions to, or timing of, satisfying these conditions.\nMany of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, as applicable). Even if regulatory approval is obtained, it is possible conditions will be imposed that could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on us. Further, though not a condition to completion of the Merger, there is a risk of availability of sufficient financing available to Knauf to allow it to pay the closing consideration.\nIf the Merger is not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed, as opposed to our current operational performance and market conditions. In addition, some costs related to the Merger must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed, and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, as well as the diversion of management and resources towards the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if completion of the Merger does not occur. We may also experience negative reactions from our investors, employees, suppliers and customers. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Knauf a termination fee of $215 million. Boral may also exercise its right to purchase our 50% interest in UBBP, as discussed further in Note 4, Equity Method Investments, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, in the event the Merger is not completed.\nThe pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nThe pendency of the Merger has caused disruptions in, and created uncertainty surrounding, our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common stock. These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger: (i) the potential negative impact on UBBP's business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of the uncertainty around the future ownership of UBBP; (ii) the effect of restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to operate our businesses under the Merger Agreement, including our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger; (iii) the risk of disruption resulting from the Merger, including the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations; (iv) the effect of the pendency of the Merger on our ability to retain and hire employees; (v) the effect of the pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results and businesses generally; (vi) the occurrence of any event giving rise to the right of a party to terminate the Merger Agreement; and (vii) the outcome of legal proceedings that have been instituted against us related to the Merger and any additional proceedings that may be instituted in the future.\nOur businesses are cyclical, regional and seasonal in nature and subject to industry downturns.\nOur businesses are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including conditions in the North American housing and construction-based markets. Housing starts in the United States remain below the long-term historical average of 1.44 million, while new nonresidential construction and the residential and nonresidential repair and remodel market in the United States have experienced slower than average growth over the past several years. Moreover, we operate in a variety of regional markets, so our businesses are subject not only to general economic conditions, but also to localized economic conditions in each of those regions. Housing and construction-based markets are impacted by broader economic circumstances, including employment levels, the availability of skilled labor, household formation, home ownership rate, new and existing home price trends, availability of mortgage financing, interest rates, deductibility of mortgage interest and real estate taxes, consumer confidence, job growth and discretionary business investment, and these markets may experience a downturn. Adverse conditions in the markets or regions where we operate, or the failure of these markets or regions to return to historical levels, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, our businesses are seasonal and impacted by pre-buy activity in advance of price increases, which has caused in the past, and will likely cause in the future, our quarterly results to vary significantly. This variability in our sales impacts our cost structure as we may need to maintain staffing levels and consistency of supply to meet anticipated demand in future quarters. In addition, unfavorable weather conditions, such as snow, heavy rainfall or natural disasters could reduce construction activity and adversely affect demand for our products.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and we may not be able to maintain current price levels for our products or achieve price increases for our products.\nThe markets for our products are competitive, and competition varies by region. Principal methods of competition include product quality and performance, range of products, product availability, product pricing, compatibility of systems and customer service. Prices for our products are affected by demand and available supply in the markets for our products. Currently, there is excess wallboard production capacity in the United States and Canada. Several of our competitors have also recently added, or are in the process of adding, capacity in the United States, and new competitors have entered certain markets, including wallboard imports from Mexico into certain regions in the South. Excess production capacity could negatively impact our ability to implement price increases or cause us to reduce pricing to maintain or grow our sales. Any inability to maintain or increase prices, particularly in light of cost inflation, including in raw materials, transportation and labor, could further adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on sales to our major customers, and the number of our customers with significant buying power is increasing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our two largest customers, The Home Depot and L&W, collectively accounted for approximately 38% of our sales, while our top four customers collectively accounted for approximately 50% of our sales. We face strong competition for these and our other major customers. As is customary in our industry, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers, which may choose to reduce or delay purchases of our products at any time. If one or more of our major customers reduces or delays substantial orders, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, particularly for the period in which the reduction or delay occurs and also possibly for subsequent periods.\nCertain of our customers are also large companies with significant buying power. The ongoing consolidation taking place in the gypsum specialty dealer channel will likely further enhance the ability of certain of our customers to seek more favorable terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future may be limited, including during periods of raw material and other cost increases such as 2018. If we are forced to reduce prices or to maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers because of pricing or other methods of competition, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nL&W is currently our largest customer in the gypsum specialty dealer channel, accounting for 14% of our consolidated net sales in 2018. Specialty dealers often have multiple suppliers for product categories. Following the sale of L&W in 2016, L&W diversified its supplier base, resulting in a reduction in our sales to L&W, and this diversification continued in 2018. To address the loss of sales to L&W, we have made efforts to grow our business with current customers and serve new customers. However, our efforts to replace the loss of sales to L&W may not be successful, and we may experience market share loss or unfavorable pricing, in which case our net sales, operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted.\nA small number of our stockholders could significantly influence our business, affairs and stock price.\nBased on filings made with the SEC, as of January 31, 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. controlled approximately 31% of our common stock and Knauf controlled approximately 10.5% of our common stock. Accordingly, a small number of our stockholders have affected, and in the future may continue to affect, matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors. One or more of these stockholders may have interests that differ from other stockholders and may vote on such matters in a way that is adverse to the interests of those other stockholders. In addition, if one or more of these stockholders engage in sales of our common stock, our share price may decline.\nIncreased costs, or decreased availability, of key raw materials, transportation or energy will increase our cost of products sold.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and energy are critical to our operations. We use substantial quantities of natural gypsum, synthetic gypsum, wastepaper, mineral fiber, steel, perlite, starch, siloxane and plastic pails. We have experienced significant inflation in the cost of many of these items. In addition, the cost of certain of these items has been volatile, and availability has sometimes been limited. We obtain some of these materials from a limited number of suppliers or sole source suppliers, which increases the risk of unavailability. We are not always able to pass increased costs on to our customers due to market conditions or existing agreements with our customers at agreed prices. In addition, imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on the importation of raw materials used in our products may increase our costs. If price increases for our finished products significantly trail the increase in costs, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. As an example, in 2018 we were not able to completely offset the significant increases in raw material costs, in particular for synthetic gypsum, natural gypsum and siloxane, which negatively impacted operating profit.\nApproximately 39% of the gypsum used in our plants is synthetic gypsum. Nine of our Gypsum plants in operation use synthetic gypsum for all of their needs, while another four use it for some of their needs. The suppliers of synthetic gypsum are primarily coal-fired electricity generating plants, many of whom have switched to using natural gas instead of coal for their electricity generation needs due to its lower cost. As a result, we have experienced increases in the cost of synthetic gypsum and the cost to transport synthetic gypsum to our plants. In addition, existing or future changes in environmental regulations may make it more difficult or costly for power companies to burn coal, which may result in a further shift away from coal-based sources of energy. If this occurs, the availability of synthetic gypsum will likely continue to decrease. We could incur substantial costs in connection with any significant reduction in the availability of synthetic gypsum, including costs to convert our plants to use natural gypsum, costs to obtain or develop additional sources of natural gypsum or increased costs to transport synthetic gypsum to our plants from farther away, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nTransportation costs are a significant portion of our variable costs because we are responsible in most cases for delivering our products to our customers. Reductions in the availability of certain modes of transportation, such as trucking, could limit our ability to deliver our products to our customers on time or obtain raw materials, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. During 2018 we experienced a shortage of available trucks and truck drivers, which resulted in significant increases in our transportation costs and adversely impacted our profitability. Increases in the cost of fuel, or if we are required to transport raw materials or finished products over longer distances, could result in further material increases in the cost of transportation that could also materially and adversely affect our operating profits.\nSimilarly, paper is also a significant component of our variable costs. We produce a majority of our wallboard paper at our paper mill in Otsego, Michigan with the remainder produced at three other company-owned production facilities, and augment our paper needs through purchases from outside suppliers when necessary. If our utilization increases or if our current supply of wallboard paper is disrupted, particularly at our Otsego paper mill, we may be required to purchase additional paper from outside suppliers, which may only be available at increased cost. We also buy various grades of wastepaper, and shortages occur periodically in one or more grades and may vary among geographic regions. As a result, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, volatility in wastepaper availability and cost, affecting the mix of products manufactured at particular locations or the cost of producing them.\nWe use natural gas extensively in the production of our products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The price of natural gas can fluctuate significantly because of weather, environmental or other regulatory changes, which can materially impact our results of operations for a particular period. In an attempt to reduce our price risk related to fluctuations in natural gas prices, we enter into hedging agreements using swaps for natural gas purchases in the United States and Canada. Because we hedge the majority of our exposures, we would not be able to participate, for the portion we hedged, in substantial or extended declines in natural gas prices. As a result, our costs would remain elevated in such an environment. During periods of rising natural gas prices on the other hand, our production costs will rise to a lesser extent because of our hedging activities.\nOur facilities may experience unexpected operational difficulties or catastrophic events.\nOur facilities may be forced to cease operations unexpectedly due to equipment failures or events beyond our control, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes or other environmental catastrophes. Any equipment downtime or facility damage may hinder our ability to meet customer demand, reduce our sales or impede our ability to deliver our products in an efficient and cost-effective manner, and could require that we make significant capital expenditures. Several of our plants, and production lines within our plants, are dedicated to specific products. If any of those plants or lines are unable to operate for a prolonged period, it would reduce our ability to effectively compete in the markets for those products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe do not have majority control over UBBP, which involves risks not otherwise present when we operate our business through wholly-owned entities.\nA substantial portion of our international operations are conducted through UBBP, which are operated in accordance with the terms of a Shareholders Agreement. UBBP involves risks not otherwise present when we operate our business through wholly-owned entities, including:\n\u2022\nEntering into the Merger Agreement to be acquired by Knauf constituted a change of control under the Shareholders Agreement such that, even if the Merger is not completed, or if certain other events of default under the Shareholders Agreement occur with respect to us, we may be required to sell our entire interest in UBBP to Boral at fair market value, as determined in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement. In the event we are forced to sell our interest in UBBP, it may be under terms that we do not consider favorable to us. On August 28, 2018, Boral delivered a default notice under the Shareholders Agreement to commence the process to establish the fair market value of our 50% interest in UBBP. Once fair market value is established, Boral will have the right to purchase our 50% interest in UBBP in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement. Boral\u2019s exercise of its right to purchase our 50% interest in UBBP could occur prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement, in which case we would receive the cash proceeds for our interest, and we would no longer own an interest in UBBP.\n\u2022\nIn the event we are required to sell our interest in UBBP to Boral, we may be restricted from competing in UBBP\u2019s markets for a period of time, many of which we anticipate to be high-growth markets. In addition, in the event we are required to sell our interest in UBBP to Boral, certain of our intellectual property will continue to be licensed to UBBP on an exclusive basis for a period of time.\n\u2022\nCertain major decisions with respect to UBBP require the majority or unanimous approval of the joint ventures\u2019 boards or shareholders, which could result in a deadlock given the 50/50 ownership and equal board representation structure. Boral may have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with ours, and we may not be able to obtain approval of certain matters that would be in our or UBBP\u2019s best interests. In addition, we may be required to spend additional resources to resolve any dispute with Boral.\n\u2022\nA deadlock with respect to certain fundamental decisions may result in the triggering of a sale process of UBBP. In such a case, the terms of the sale may be less attractive than if we had held onto our investment.\n\u2022\nThe Shareholders Agreement limits our ability to transfer our interest in UBBP. As a result, we may be unable to sell our interest in UBBP when we would otherwise like.\n\u2022\nUBBP may not pay dividends if such payments are, among other things, restricted pursuant to the terms of the credit facilities maintained by UBBP, inconsistent with the then-applicable strategic plan, or illegal. Accordingly, we may not receive dividend payments from UBBP in the amounts that we currently anticipate or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to receive any economic benefit from UBBP.\n\u2022\nIn the event Boral is subject to a change of control, or if certain other events of default under the Shareholders Agreement occur with respect to Boral, we will have the right to acquire Boral\u2019s interest in UBBP at fair market value, but it may be on terms that we do not find favorable. In this circumstance, if we do not complete the\nacquisition due to lack of funding or otherwise, we would remain in the joint venture, but possibly under ownership that we do not find acceptable.\n\u2022\nIn certain circumstances, a capital call may be issued to the shareholders of UBBP in order to obtain additional funding for the joint ventures' operations. If we do not provide capital and Boral does, Boral may receive additional shares in UBBP, thereby diluting our interest and diminishing our rights under the Shareholders Agreement. Further, although we intend for UBBP to be self-funding, we may nonetheless determine in the future that we need to provide additional capital in order for UBBP to continue operating.\n\u2022\nBoral may become insolvent, refuse to make additional capital contributions or fail to meet its obligations under the Shareholders Agreement or the two share sale and subscription agreements entered into with Boral, which may result in certain liabilities to us.\n\u2022\nUBBP has relied in part on new products and technology we have developed. UBBP is contractually entitled to some, but not all, of our new products and recently licensed several new products and technologies from us, including USG Sheetrock\u00ae Brand EcoSmart Panels and Ensemble\u00ae Acoustical Drywall Ceiling. If UBBP is unable to successfully commercialize on our innovation efforts, the opportunity to grow the joint ventures or for us to deploy our products in UBBP\u2019s territory will be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nUBBP is required to protect our licensed trade secrets and confidential intellectual property in its territory, which includes countries where there is a high risk of intellectual property loss, and we also expend significant efforts to secure and enforce our intellectual property rights in UBBP\u2019s territory. If UBBP is not diligent with its protections or our efforts are insufficient and competitors acquire our trade secrets and confidential intellectual property, then there may be a material adverse impact on our business both inside and outside of UBBP\u2019s territory.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur international operations expose us to risks that would not otherwise be present in our U.S. operations.\nOur international business operations in the countries within the territory of UBBP and in Canada and Mexico, including our ability to introduce new products into these markets, are important to our operations, growth and prospects. Our foreign operations and our international expansion subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nsensitivity to general economic conditions in each of the countries in which we or UBBP operate, including, in particular, the housing and construction-based markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with United States laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery laws and regulations, or corruption in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of local laws and regulations, including environmental and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. or foreign tax laws and the interpretation of those laws;\n\u2022\nimposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales outside the United States, including cross-border intercompany sales;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency values and the impact on our consolidated results;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\ndiscriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights, and securing information and infrastructure, in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and\n\u2022\nnationalization of properties by foreign governments.\nMoreover, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, epidemics, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to innovate and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nWe believe that we maintain a leadership position and price premium in part because of our innovation and introduction of new products. As a result, our success also depends, in part, upon securing and enforcing our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contractual rights and patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our intellectual property, the steps we have taken may be limited in their effect. Existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws offer only limited protection, and it may be expensive and time consuming to assert these protections against competitors who infringe on our rights, and our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offer similar competing products that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This risk may be heightened in connection with our investments in UBBP because it results in the use of our intellectual property in additional foreign jurisdictions, some of which lack robust or accessible intellectual property protection enforcement mechanisms.\nWe intend to continue making investments in research and development to develop new and improved products and more efficient manufacturing methods in order to maintain our market leadership position. If we do not make these investments, or we are not able to successfully commercialize our innovation efforts, our revenues, operating results and market share may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur businesses are capital intensive, leading to high levels of fixed costs, and capital expenditures to maintain our market leadership position and expand our businesses may not achieve their intended results.\nOur businesses are capital intensive, and regularly require capital expenditures to maintain equipment, expand operations, improve efficiency and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We are limited in our ability to quickly reduce fixed costs in response to reduced demand for our products, so these fixed costs may result in higher average unit costs and lower margins if we are unable to offset with price increases. Alternatively, we may not be able to quickly respond to unanticipated increased demand for our products, which could result in our inability to satisfy customer demand and loss of market share.\nIn order to standardize and automate production across our businesses, we are investing in capital improvement projects, including an anticipated $300 million investment in Advanced Manufacturing that began in late 2016, which we believe will materially improve our operating results. Future downturns in our industry or businesses may prevent us from having the funds necessary to make anticipated capital expenditures, and there may be delays or cost increases in completing these projects. Our return on investment from our Advanced Manufacturing investments or other capital expenditures may not be sufficient to recover the expenses associated with these initiatives and we may not achieve the expected $100 million in incremental EBITDA from Advanced Manufacturing in the anticipated timeframe. See Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity Outlook for additional information regarding our Advanced Manufacturing initiatives.\nA disruption in our information technology systems due to a catastrophic event or security breach could interrupt or damage our operations.\nIn the conduct of our business we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems. We have put in place security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to, or corruption of, our information systems and data or disruption of our operations. However, advanced cybersecurity threats are increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. The security measures we have implemented may not be sufficient to prevent breaches, and we may be required to incur additional costs to strengthen our systems as cyber-attacks continue to evolve. Any security breach or compromise of our information systems could significantly impact our operations, damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or company information, including our intellectual property, and result in significant losses, litigation, fines and costs. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is also growing more rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.\nWe also compete through our use and improvement of information technology. In order to remain competitive, we need to provide customers with timely, accurate, easy-to-access information about product availability, orders and delivery status. While we have provided manual processes for short-term failures and disaster recovery capability, a prolonged disruption of systems or other failure to meet customers\u2019 expectations regarding the capabilities and reliability of our systems may materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nCompliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations or product safety concerns could cause us to make modifications to how we manufacture our products, negatively affect our results and also require that we make significant capital investments or otherwise increase our costs.\nWe operate plants, mines and quarries in North America. As a result, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. If we were to fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could incur fines, penalties or other sanctions and be subject to private litigation. In addition, in the past we have been, and in the future could be, held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. Further, new environmental and safety laws and regulations may cause us to incur material expenses relating to compliance, impact the availability and cost of raw materials and have a material and adverse impact on our operations and results.\nMany U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering measures to reduce greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. Legislation or regulations requiring reductions in GHG emissions could affect future expansions or modifications at our plants, mines and quarries and may require that we incur significant costs and additional capital investment to satisfy permitting requirements. In addition, enactment of new climate change legislation, regulatory initiatives or treaties impacting the locations where we conduct business could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, legislation establishing a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d on energy use or a \u201ccap and trade\u201d could materially and adversely increase the cost of energy used in our manufacturing processes.\nLegal challenges to the U.S. EPA\u2019s final rule regarding the use of synthetic gypsum, or subsequent state legislation, could also result in laws or regulations that adversely affect the classification, use, storage and disposal of synthetic gypsum. Such laws or regulations may require significant capital investments to convert those plants and lines that use synthetic gypsum to natural gypsum.\nThe building materials industry has been subject to claims relating to raw materials, as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards and a strong commitment to product safety and quality. However, if our products do not meet applicable safety standards or customers\u2019 expectations regarding safety, we could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risks. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could negatively affect our business and results of operations, and product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances to cover claims that may arise in the future.\nLegal and governmental proceedings, including those involving antitrust, tax, environmental, intellectual property, the Merger or other matters, may result in significant costs.\nWe are party to litigation and governmental proceedings, including legal proceedings in connection with the Merger. We could become subject to additional legal claims in the future, some of which could become material. We may also initiate legal proceedings to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. The outcome of legal and governmental proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation and governmental proceedings are often difficult to reliably predict. Various developments can lead to changes in management\u2019s estimates of liabilities. Those developments include judicial rulings or judgments, settlements, or regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period, or we could be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property. For a more detailed discussion of certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions to complement or expand our businesses, which even if completed, may involve a number of risks, or we may not be able to pursue a desired transaction under the Merger Agreement.\nWe may pursue additional opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies and to form joint ventures that we believe could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Such pursuits may be costly and unsuccessful and cause diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations. Even if completed, potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things, difficulty with integrating\nbusiness operations, infrastructure and personnel, and our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we and our subsidiaries are prohibited from acquiring any business or forming any joint venture, subject to certain exceptions. This restriction to pursue a transaction that we may otherwise believe to be in our best interest could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nSignificant changes in factors and assumptions used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations, actual investment returns on pension assets and other factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nThe recognition of costs and liabilities associated with the pension and postretirement plans is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on costs and liabilities are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates, and mortality rates. These assumptions are generally updated annually.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our pension plans were underfunded by $137 million and our unfunded postretirement plan liabilities were approximately $132 million. While discount rates have increased in 2018, in recent years declining interest rates have negatively impacted the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans. If the interest rates decline again, funding requirements for our pension plans may become more significant. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations under these pension and postretirement plans, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or incur indebtedness.\nWe are generally not permitted to return capital to our stockholders under the Merger Agreement, and even if we are able to do so, we may not be able to fully execute our stock repurchase program and may not otherwise return capital to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nIn February 2018 we announced an increase in our stock repurchase program, bringing the total size of the program to $500 million. However, the Merger Agreement limits our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain exceptions, and share repurchases under the program will not continue so long as the Merger Agreement is in effect and has not been terminated. If the program were to recommence, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares or value that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time. Whether we make any further repurchases would depend on many factors, including but not limited to our business and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the time, including the price of our shares, and other factors that management considers relevant. Additionally, we expect to fund any repurchases under our stock repurchase program through cash on hand, which may impact our ability to pursue potential strategic opportunities. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness and there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement also limits our ability to declare any dividend in respect of our common stock, other than the conditional special dividend paid to holders of our common stock in connection with the Merger. Other than the conditional special dividend, we have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the first quarter of 2001, and there can be no assurance that we will do so in the foreseeable future.\nOur credit agreement also limits our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our stock unless specified borrowing availability and fixed charge coverage ratio tests are met, and it prohibits payment of a dividend or repurchase of our stock if a default exists under the agreement. Accordingly, we may be required to cease repurchasing stock for periods of time in order to maintain compliance with our credit agreement terms. If we do not pay dividends or continue to execute on our stock repurchase program, investors will have to rely on the possibility of stock appreciation and sell their shares to realize a return on their investment.\nWe may not be able to pursue certain strategic opportunities unless we increase our indebtedness and leverage ratio. Our level of indebtedness also requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to debt payments and limits our ability to engage in certain business activities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of outstanding debt, consisting of senior notes and industrial revenue bonds, which is slightly above our target leverage ratio range of 1.5x to 2.0x adjusted debt/EBITDA. We may not be able to pursue certain strategic opportunities that may otherwise be available to us without incurring additional indebtedness and thereby increasing our leverage ratio outside of our target range.\nOur current debt service obligations also require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which reduces the availability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including capital expenditures, research and development efforts, potential acquisitions or investments. If we are unable to fund our business activities, meet our obligations under our debt agreements or are contractually restricted from pursuing activities or transactions that we believe are in our long-term best interests, including any activities prohibited by the Merger Agreement, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Our indebtedness also may increase our vulnerability to economic and industry downturns and changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. We are required to post letters of credit or cash as collateral primarily in connection with our hedging transactions, insurance programs and bonding activities. The amounts of collateral we are required to post may vary based on our financial position and credit ratings. Use of letters of credit as collateral reduces our borrowing availability under our domestic revolving credit agreement and, therefore, like the use of cash as collateral, reduces our overall liquidity and our ability to fund other business activities.\nThe terms of our debt agreements, including our credit facility, may also limit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may be in our long-term interest. Among other things, unless we obtain approval, the covenants contained in our debt agreements may restrict or limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or repurchase our common stock, make guarantees, sell our assets or make other fundamental changes, engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, make investments, change our business purpose, or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. We may also be required to maintain specified financial ratios, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business plans. Our ability to comply with these covenants and financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those covenants and ratios. Breach of any of the covenants or ratios contained in the agreements governing our debt, or our inability to pay interest on, or principal of, our outstanding debt as it becomes due, could result in an event of default, in which case, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to refinance the accelerated debt on favorable terms, or at all, or repay the accelerated debt, and our liquidity may be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 79244, "SIC": 3270, "TIC": "USG"}
