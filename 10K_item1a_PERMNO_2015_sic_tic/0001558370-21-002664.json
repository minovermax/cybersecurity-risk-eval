{"cik": "1071993", "company": "CONTANGO OIL & GAS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating the Company, as well as all other information presented in this Form 10-K. An investment in the Company is subject to risks inherent in our business, and the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that harm our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future. The trading price of the shares of the Company is affected by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions. The value of an investment in the Company may decrease, resulting in a loss.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, and the ultimate effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe worldwide economic downturn, significantly disrupting the demand for oil throughout the world and has created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. This has led to a significant global oversupply of oil and a subsequent substantial decrease in oil prices. While global oil producers, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other oil producing nations reached an agreement to cut oil production in April 2020, downward pressure on, and volatility in, commodity prices has remained and could continue for the foreseeable future, particularly given concerns over available storage capacity for oil, which have negatively affected and are expected to continue to negatively affect our cash flow, liquidity and financial position. In response to the decrease in commodity prices, beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we suspended any further plans for operated onshore and offshore drilling in 2020. Oil prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of these events and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and as changes in oil inventories, oil demand and economic performance are reported. We cannot predict when, or to what extent, the negative effects of COVID-19 on the world and domestic economies, and on our industry and Company, will improve, or when oil prices will improve and stabilize.\nWhile there has been a modest recovery in oil prices, the length of this demand disruption is unknown, and there is significant uncertainty regarding the long-term impact to global oil demand, which will ultimately depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and spread of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus mutations and resurgences, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or mitigate its impact, related restrictions on travel, the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on domestic and global oil demand, the availability of personnel, equipment, and services critical to our ability to operate our properties, and how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The COVID-19 pandemic may also precipitate or intensify the risks described in the risk factors disclosed in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nWe have no ability to control the market price for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and a continued substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and growth and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues, profitability and future growth depend significantly on oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Oil prices, natural gas prices and NGL prices remained low during the past several years relative to the high prices in 2014 and have been significantly adversely impacted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite recent recovery. The markets for these commodities are volatile and prices received affect the amount of future cash flow available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness and our ability to raise additional capital. Lower prices also affect the\namount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce. Prices fluctuate and decline based on factors beyond our control. Factors that can cause price fluctuations and declines include:\n\u25cf Overall economic and market conditions, domestic and global.\n\u25cf The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced demand for oil and natural gas, economic slowdown, governmental actions and stay-at-home orders.\n\u25cf The domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas.\n\u25cf The level of consumer product demand.\n\u25cf The cost of exploring for, developing, producing, refining and marketing oil, natural gas and NGLs.\n\u25cf Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change and health emergencies and pandemics.\n\u25cf The price and availability of competitive fuels such as LNG, heating oil and coal, and alternative fuels.\n\u25cf The level of LNG imports and exports and natural gas exports.\n\u25cf Political and economic conditions in the Middle East and other oil and natural gas producing regions.\n\u25cf The ability of the members of OPEC and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls.\n\u25cf Domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including temporary orders limiting economic activity.\n\u25cf Special taxes on production or the loss of tax credits and deductions.\n\u25cf Technological advances affecting energy consumption and sources of energy supply.\n\u25cf Access to pipelines and gas processing plants and other capacity constraints or production disruptions.\n\u25cf The effects of energy conservation efforts, including by virtue of shareholder activism or activities of non-governmental organizations.\nA substantial or extended decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices could have a material adverse effect on our access to capital and the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that may be economically produced by us. We may utilize financial derivative contracts, such as swaps, costless collars and puts on commodity prices, to reduce some of the exposure to potential declines in commodity prices. However, these derivative contracts may not be sufficient to mitigate the effect of lower commodity prices.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in new or emerging plays, and a reduction in our drilling program may affect our revenues and access to capital.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and with longer production history. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion strategies and techniques in these formations will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. Accordingly, our drilling results are subject to greater risks in these areas and could be unsuccessful. We may be unable to execute our expected drilling program in these areas because of disappointing drilling results, capital constraints, lease expirations, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline take-away capacity, availability of drilling rigs and other services or otherwise, and/or oil, natural gas and NGL price declines. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a charge of $10.5 million for drilling and prospect costs included in \u201cExploration expenses\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately $2.7 million of the exploration expense was prospect acquisition costs incurred in 2019 which were reclassified to exploration expense in 2020 as a result of the dry hole. We could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future if our drilling results are unsuccessful. In 2020, we recorded a $4.3 million non-cash charge for unproved impairment expense related to\nundeveloped leases in our Central Oklahoma, Western Anadarko and Other Onshore regions. We recorded $2.6 million of this impairment expense in the first quarter of 2020, primarily related to leases we acquired from White Star and Will Energy in the fourth quarter of 2019, which were expiring in 2020, and the remaining $1.7 million of this impairment expense was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to leases expiring in 2021, all of which we have no plans to extend or develop as a result of the current commodity price environment and our continued focus on cost saving and production enhancing initiatives.\nAs a result of the continuing turmoil in the energy commodity price markets, we do not currently plan to commit any additional near-term drilling capital to our major areas of West Texas, Central Oklahoma, Western Anadarko or other areas within our portfolio, except to fulfill leasehold commitments and preserve core acreage where necessary and, where determined appropriate to do so, expand our presence in those existing areas. Without any incremental production resulting from our acquisition efforts, any further reduction in our drilling program will adversely affect our future production levels and future cash flow generated from operations. Furthermore, to the extent we are unable to execute our expected drilling program, our return on investment may not be as attractive as we anticipate, and our common stock price may decrease.\nWe rely on third-party contract operators to drill, complete and manage some of our wells, production platforms, pipelines and processing facilities and, as a result, we have limited control over the daily operations of such equipment and facilities.\nWe depend upon the services of third-party operators to operate drilling rigs, completion operations, offshore production platforms, pipelines, gas processing facilities and the infrastructure required to produce and market our natural gas, condensate and oil. We have limited influence over the conduct of operations by third-party operators. As a result, we have little control over how frequently and how long our operations are down or our production is shut-in when problems, weather and other production shut-ins occur. Poor performance on the part of, or errors or accidents attributable to, the operator of a project in which we participate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure of our working interest partners to fund their share of development costs could result in the delay or cancellation of future projects, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur working interest partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities or other sources. If our partners are not able to fund their share of costs, it could result in the delay or cancellation of future projects, resulting in a reduction of our reserves and production, or the Company incurring a bad debt charge, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risks of our customers, contractual counterparties and derivative counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, contractual counterparties or derivative counterparties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and contractual counterparties, which risks may increase during periods of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, some of our customers and contractual counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our significant customers or counterparties is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these customers or counterparties may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, including pursuant to our current and future joint development agreements, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our risk management activities are subject to the risks that a counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument, the terms of the derivative instruments are imperfect, and our risk management policies and procedures are not properly followed. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or our derivative counterparties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRepeated offshore production shut-ins can possibly damage our well bores.\nOur offshore well bores are required to be shut-in from time to time due to a variety of issues, including a combination of weather, mechanical problems, sand production, bottom sediment, water and paraffin associated with our condensate production, as well as downstream third-party facility and pipeline shut-ins. In addition, shut-ins are necessary from time to time to upgrade and improve the production handling capacity at related downstream platform, gas processing and pipeline infrastructure. In addition to negatively impacting our near-term revenues and cash flow, repeated production shut-ins may damage our well bores if repeated excessively or not executed properly. The loss of a well bore due to damage could require us to drill a replacement well, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOil and natural gas reserves are depleting assets and the failure to replace our reserves would adversely affect our production and cash flows.\nOur future oil and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring new reserves. If we fail to replace reserves, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely impacted. Production from oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Furthermore, initial production rates in shale plays tend to decline steeply in the first twelve months of production and are not necessarily indicative of sustained production rates. Our total proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Additionally, the majority of our reserves are proved developed producing. Accordingly, we do not have significant opportunities to increase our production from our existing proved reserves. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. If we are not successful, our future production and revenues will be adversely affected.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including many factors that are beyond our control. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities of reserves shown in this report.\nIn order to prepare these estimates, our internal and independent third-party petroleum engineers must project production rates and timing of development expenditures as well as analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions relating to matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and pre-tax net present value of reserves shown in a reserve report. In addition, estimates of our proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and may prove to be incorrect over time. As a result, our estimates may require substantial upward or downward revisions if subsequent drilling, testing and production reveal different results. Furthermore, some of the producing wells included in our reserve report have produced for a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, some of our reserve estimates are not based on a multi-year production decline curve and are calculated using a reservoir simulation model together with volumetric analysis. Any downward adjustment could indicate lower future production and thus adversely affect our financial condition, future prospects and market value. Moreover, failure to meet operating or financial forecasts and expectations, whether published by us or market participants, could adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nApproximately 20% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2020 were proved undeveloped reserves. The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nRecovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. Although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards, we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate, held flat for the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. The present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 was based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period January through December 2020. For our condensate and natural gas liquids, the average West Texas Intermediate (Cushing) posted price was $39.57 per barrel, and the average Henry Hub spot price was $2.14 per MMBtu for natural gas, as prepared by Cobb. Any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock. Actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by oil and natural gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. The timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor.\nOur use of 2D and 3D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are uncertain. However, even when used and properly interpreted, 3D seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators. They do not allow the interpreter to know if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically. Other geologists and petroleum professionals, when studying the same seismic data, may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals.\nIn addition, the use of 3D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses due to such expenditures. If exploratory drilling of a prospect, such as the well subject to our joint operating agreement with Juneau, is not successful, we may be required to incur additional expenditures relating to abandonment of the well, with no corresponding revenues. As a result, our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be unprofitable, not only\nfrom dry holes, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u25cf unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations;\n\u25cf abnormal pressure formations, reservoir compaction, surface cratering or uncontrollable flows of underground oil, natural gas or formation water;\n\u25cf pipe and cement failures, casing collapses, stuck drilling and service tools;\n\u25cf explosions, fires and blowouts;\n\u25cf environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u25cf loss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u25cf title problems;\n\u25cf facility or equipment malfunctions and failures;\n\u25cf unexpected operational events;\n\u25cf shortages of skilled personnel and regulations or conditions that limit the availability of personnel to operate our business or assets;\n\u25cf gathering, transportation and processing availability, restrictions or limitations;\n\u25cf deviations from the desired drilling zone or not running casing or tools consistently through the wellbore, particularly as lateral lengths get longer;\n\u25cf shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services or of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u25cf compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf stockholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of GHGs;\n\u25cf natural disasters;\n\u25cf public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property, reservoirs, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, clean-up responsibilities, loss of wells, repairs to resume operations; suspension of our operations and regulatory fines or penalties.\nInsurance against all operational risks is not available to us. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. We carry limited environmental insurance; therefore, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe potential lack of availability of, or cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget.\nWhen the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids increase, or the demand for equipment and services is greater than the supply in certain areas, such as the Southern Delaware Basin, we typically encounter an increase in the cost of securing drilling rigs, equipment and supplies. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA sustained continuation of product transportation, processing and market constraints in the Southern Delaware Basin may adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our oil and natural gas properties in the region.\nThe Permian Basin, which includes the Southern Delaware Basin in which we have significant oil and natural gas properties, has been subject to significant product transportation and market constraints resulting from the increased drilling activity and consequent increased production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the region. One of the results of these constraints over the past several years is the development of significant negative field pricing differentials for Southern Delaware Basin oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production when compared to prices at major domestic oil and natural gas product hubs. While extensive capital investments are being made to provide additional production transportation, natural gas processing and alternative markets in the region, there is no assurance as to when or if any of these additional midstream and alternative market projects might be made available to our production or at what cost. If these constraints and consequent pricing differentials continue unabated for a significant amount of time, the financial returns for oil and natural gas assets in the Southern Delaware Basin may be considerably devalued when compared to oil and natural gas investments in hydrocarbon producing regions with greater access to major hydrocarbon markets.\nProduction activities in the Gulf of Mexico increase our susceptibility to pollution and natural resource damage.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing and collisions. In addition, offshore operations, including operations along the Gulf Coast, are subject to damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of properties.\nFurther, a blowout, rupture or spill of any magnitude would present serious operational and financial challenges. All of the Company\u2019s operations in the Gulf of Mexico shelf are in water depths of less than 300 feet and less than 50 miles from the coast. Such proximity to the shoreline increases the probability of a biological impact or damaging the fragile eco-system in the event of released condensate.\nOur ability to market our oil and natural gas may be impaired by capacity constraints and equipment malfunctions on the platforms, gathering systems, pipelines and gas plants that transport and process our oil and natural gas.\nAll of our oil and natural gas is transported through gathering systems, pipelines and processing plants. Transportation capacity on gathering system pipelines and platforms is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to these facilities or due to capacity being utilized by other natural gas or oil shippers that may have priority transportation agreements. If the gathering systems, processing plants, platforms or our transportation capacity is materially restricted or is unavailable in the future, our ability to market our natural gas or oil could be impaired and cash flow from the affected properties could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, repeated shut-ins of our wells could result in damage to our well bores that would impair our ability to produce from these wells and could result in additional wells being required to produce our reserves.\nIf our access to sales markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possible loss of a lease due to lack of production.\nWe may not have title to our leased interests and if any lease is later rendered invalid, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site.\nOur practice in acquiring exploration leases or undivided interests in oil and natural gas leases is to not incur the expense of retaining title lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest prior to executing the lease. Instead, we rely upon the judgment of consultants and others to perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental, county or parish clerk\u2019s office before leasing a specific mineral interest. This practice is widely followed in the industry. Prior to the drilling of an exploration well, the operator of the well will typically obtain a preliminary title review of the drill site lease and/or spacing unit within which the proposed well is to be drilled to identify any obvious deficiencies in title to the well and, if there are deficiencies, to identify measures necessary to cure those defects to the extent reasonably possible. However, such deficiencies may not have been cured by the operator of such wells. It does happen, from time to time, that the examination made by title lawyers reveals that the lease or leases are invalid, having been purchased in error from a person who is not the rightful owner of the mineral interest desired. In these circumstances, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site or may incur costs to remedy a defect. It may also happen, from time to time, that the operator may elect to proceed with a well despite defects to the title identified in the preliminary title opinion.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than many of our competitors.\nWe compete with a broad range of oil and natural gas companies in our exploration and property acquisition activities. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. Further, they may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to explore for oil and natural gas and to acquire additional properties in the future depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, many of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time than we have and have substantially larger staffs. We may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or in such a highly competitive environment.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team, our exploration partners, third-party consultants and engineers and other key personnel, and any failure to retain the services of such parties could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy and handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy is highly dependent on our management team, as well as certain key geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals engaged by us. The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified technical professionals could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to manage our growth, if any, will require us to continue to train, motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for\nthese types of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.\nAcquisition prospects are difficult to assess and may pose additional risks to our operations.\nWe expect to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities on terms our management considers favorable. The successful acquisition of oil and natural gas properties or businesses requires an assessment of:\n\u25cf Recoverable reserves.\n\u25cf Exploration potential.\n\u25cf Future oil and natural gas prices.\n\u25cf Operating costs.\n\u25cf Potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors.\n\u25cf Permitting and other authorizations, including environmental permits and authorizations, required for our operations.\n\u25cf Impact on leverage and access to capital.\nIn connection with such an assessment, we would expect to perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Nonetheless, the resulting conclusions are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain and such an assessment may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it necessarily permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Future acquisitions could pose additional risks to our operations and financial results, including:\n\u25cf Problems integrating the purchased operations, personnel or technologies.\n\u25cf Unanticipated costs.\n\u25cf Diversion of resources and management attention from our exploration business.\n\u25cf Entry into regions or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\n\u25cf Potential loss of key employees of the acquired organization.\n\u25cf Dilution from issuance of new equity.\n\u25cf Increased capital commitments or leverage.\nWe may be unable to integrate the business of Mid-Con or Silvertip successfully or realize the anticipated benefits of each.\nOn January 21, 2021, we closed the Mid-Con Acquisition, and on February 1, 2021, we completed the Silvertip Acquisition. The combination of multiple independent businesses is complex, costly and time consuming. Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u25cf the inability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Mid-Con and Silvertip in a manner that permits us to achieve, on a timely basis or at all, the enhanced revenue opportunities and cost savings and other benefits and synergies anticipated to result from the merger; diversion of resources and management attention from our legacy business;\n\u25cf complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in operational philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology,\nnetworks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u25cf the assumption of contractual obligations with less favorable or more restrictive terms; and\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger.\nIn addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u25cf diversion of the attention of our management; and\n\u25cf the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nAny of these issues could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWhen we acquire properties, in most cases, we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities.\nWe generally acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties, and in these situations we cannot assure you that we will identify all areas of existing or potential exposure. In those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre-closing liabilities, we cannot assure you that the seller will be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. In addition, the competition to acquire producing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties is intense and many of our larger competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire producing oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties that have economically recoverable reserves for acceptable prices.\nCybersecurity breaches and information technology failures could harm our business by increasing our costs and negatively impacting our operations.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including internet sites, computer software, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties we use in our operations, may be vulnerable to a variety of evolving cybersecurity risks, such as those involving unauthorized access or control, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks, ransomware and other security issues. Moreover, cybersecurity threat actors, whether internal or external to us, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access a Company\u2019s information technology systems and data, including the information technology systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom companies conduct business.\nAlthough we have implemented information technology controls and systems that are designed to protect information and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity risks, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the controls we have installed have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future, so continuously reviewing, evaluating and enhancing those controls is a priority for our information technology group. During the first quarter of 2020, we were a victim of cyber intrusion, whereby an encryption-based virus was downloaded by third-party hackers into one of the Company\u2019s networks. Our information technology team detected the intrusion shortly thereafter and locked down the systems to prevent further intrusion. We reacted quickly by engaging outside experts experienced in dealing with these situations, thereby limiting the extent of intrusion, equipment damage and system downtime. It was ultimately determined that no private information was lost, and that only certain equipment had to be scrubbed of the virus before it could be put back in service. The overall cost of the intrusion event was minimal. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, including key customers and suppliers, could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources;\n\u25cf Data corruption, communication interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\u25cf Data corruption or operational disruptions of production-related infrastructure could result in a loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u25cf A cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects;\n\u25cf A cyber attack on third-party gathering, pipeline or rail transportation systems could delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf A cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u25cf A cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices and reduced revenues;\n\u25cf A cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u25cf A deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u25cf A cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s or landowner\u2019s data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nAll of the above could negatively impact our operational and financial results. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nFinancial Risks\nThe reduction in the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement, and any further reductions as a result of periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash from operations. The borrowing base under our Credit Agreement is subject to semi-annual redeterminations which occur on May 1st and November 1st of each year. During a borrowing base redetermination, the lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our Credit Agreement. The borrowing base depends on, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing our loan, many of which factors are beyond our control. On October 30, 2020, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which increased the borrowing base to $130.0 million upon the closing of the Mid-Con Acquisition on January 21, 2021, and which provides that the borrowing base will be automatically reduced by $10 million on March 31, 2021.\nThe semi-annual redeterminations of our bank borrowing base will occur on May 1st and November 1st of each year. The borrowing base may also be adjusted by certain events, including the incurrence of any senior unsecured debt, material asset dispositions or liquidation of hedges in excess of certain thresholds. Should a determination be made to lower the borrowing base to a level less than our outstanding indebtedness thereunder on the date of such reduction, the excess indebtedness (i.e. a \u201cdeficiency\u201d) would exist that we would be required to repay, depending on certain scenarios, either immediately or over a period of six months. Should such a determination be made that creates a deficiency, we may be required to obtain additional capital from monetizing hedges or accessing the capital markets. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain new capital on acceptable terms, we may be unable to operate our producing properties, recommence or implement our respective drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to comply with restrictions and covenants in our Credit Agreement, there could be a default under the terms of the agreement, which could result in an acceleration of payments of funds that we have borrowed.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants. These negative covenants may limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make loans to others; make investments; enter into mergers; make or declare dividends or distributions; enter into commodity hedges exceeding a specified percentage of our expected production; enter into interest rate hedges exceeding a specified percentage of our outstanding indebtedness; incur liens; sell assets, including any of our oil and natural gas properties, unless we comply with certain conditions; and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders. Our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness is uncertain and will be affected by our future performance and events or circumstances beyond our control. We may be required to seek waivers under the Credit Agreement and modifications of covenants, or to reduce our debt by, among other things, reducing our bank borrowing base, issuing equity or completing asset sales and other liquidity-enhancing activities, and these efforts may not be successful. If we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or other agreements governing our indebtedness, an event of default could result, which could permit acceleration of such debt and acceleration of our other debt. Any accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of undeveloped acreage and/or a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and/or proceeds from non-core asset sales, issuances of preferred and common stock (subject to market conditions). Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u25cf Our proved reserves.\n\u25cf The level of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we are able to produce from existing wells.\n\u25cf The prices at which oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold.\n\u25cf Our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels, to further develop and exploit our current properties, or to conduct exploratory activity. In order to fund our capital expenditures, we may need to seek additional financing. Our Credit Agreement contains covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness without the consent of the lenders. Our lenders may withhold this consent in their sole discretion. In addition, if our borrowing base redetermination results in a lower borrowing base under our Credit Agreement, we may be unable to obtain funds otherwise currently available under our Credit Agreement. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. In particular, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms that are similar to existing debt, and reduced, or in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.\nOur hedging activities could result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices and price differentials of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as interest rates, we enter into, and may in the future enter into, over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivative arrangements for a substantial, but varying portion of our oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids production and our debt that could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses. We typically utilize financial instruments to hedge commodity price exposure to declining prices on our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. We typically use a combination of puts, swaps and costless collars.\nOur production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into hedging transactions for such period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nIf prices decline, we may incur further impairment of proved properties and experience a reduction in our proved undeveloped reserves.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $164.4 million non-cash charge for proved property impairment of our onshore and offshore properties related to the dramatic decline in commodity prices, the \u201cPV-10\u201d\n(present value, discounted at a 10% rate) of our proved reserves, and the associated change in our development plans for our proved, undeveloped locations.\nIf management\u2019s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and/or natural gas prices continue to remain depressed, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment write-downs in the future, which would result in a negative impact to our financial results. Furthermore, any sustained decline in oil and/or natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments. We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review. To determine if a depletable unit is impaired, we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management\u2019s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and natural gas reserves over the economic life of the property. Future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers\u2019 estimates of proved reserves. In addition, other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions. For each property determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis.\nFair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows. Any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization to reduce our recorded cost basis in the asset. Each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment, including the determination of the depletable units\u2019 estimated reserves, future cash flows and fair value.\nManagement\u2019s assumptions used in calculating oil and natural gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future. Any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded, impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset. Any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property, as well as the property\u2019s fair value. Additionally, as management\u2019s views related to future prices change, the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates. Changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment. An impairment may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the trading price of our common stock.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact our business, share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions, capital expenditures or other purposes.\nInterest rates may increase in the future. Assuming an outstanding balance on our Credit Agreement of $9.0 million, an increase of one percentage point in the interest rates would have resulted in an increase in interest expense during 2020 of $0.1 million. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Rising interest rates could reduce the amount of cash we generate and materially adversely affect our liquidity. Moreover, the trading price of our common stock is sensitive to changes in interest rates and could be materially adversely affected by any increase in interest rates.\nOur indebtedness under our Credit Agreement bears interest at variable interest rates that use the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBO Rate\u201d) as a benchmark rate. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration for purposes of the ICE Benchmark Administration setting the London interbank offered rate. Such announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBO Rate on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and the LIBO Rate may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Although our Credit Agreement provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest, such alternative rate may not be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in or changes to interest rates.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in\nthat market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. In November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions, but the rule was not adopted. In December 2016, the CFTC proposed another new version of the rule, but that too was not adopted. In February 2020, the CFTC proposed another version of its position limits rule that is currently pending at the agency. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing, and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. In addition, the CFTC and certain banking regulators have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we currently qualify for the end-user exception to the mandatory clearing, trade-execution and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, if any of our swaps did not qualify for the end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows.\nThe full impact of the various regulatory requirements will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. In addition, recently, proposals have been made by U.S. banking regulators which, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase the capital requirements for certain participants in the OTC derivatives market in which we participate. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, such as the recently proposed increased capital requirements regulation, could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts or increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and may continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. While no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date at the federal level, the EPA and states and groupings of states have considered or pursued cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In particular, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United\nStates, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities, which includes certain of our operations.\nFederal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) Subpart OOOOa standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expanded the previously issued NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements issued in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. However, in 2020, the EPA rescinded methane and volatile organic compound emissions standards for new and modified oil and gas transmission and storage infrastructure, as well as methane limits for new and modified oil and gas production and processing equipment. The EPA also relaxed requirements for oil and gas operators to monitor emissions leaks. These amendments are currently being challenged in federal court\nFurthermore, in late 2016, the BLM published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring and leaks from oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Native American lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinds most of the new requirements of the 2016 final rule and codifies the BLM\u2019s prior approach to venting and flaring, but this revised rule was vacated by a California federal district court in 2020, a decision which BLM has appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, separately, the federal district court of Wyoming vacated the original 2016 rule in October 2020. These rules, should they remain or be placed in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and natural gas sector could result in increased costs to our operations as well as result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in such operations, which costs, restrictions, delays or cancellations could adversely affect our business. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future international, federal or state laws or regulations that impose reporting obligations on us with respect to, or require the elimination of GHG emissions from, our equipment or operations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, which could reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which devaluation could be significant.\nNotwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. It should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our wells and related facilities, rig availability for drilling new or replacement wells, impact our ability to conduct our production and/or drilling operations and/or result in a disruption of the operations of our customers and service providers. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation or investigations, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. The ultimate impact of GHGs emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on our financial performance is highly uncertain because we are unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of the FERC, the CFTC or the FTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. We believe that the gas gathering facilities we own meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline system\u2019s status as a non-jurisdictional gatherer. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering\nservices is the subject of litigation from time to time, so the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC and the courts. Our failure to comply with this or other laws and regulations administered by the FERC could subject us to substantial penalties, as described in Part I, Item 1: \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters.\u201d\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and implementing regulations, the FERC prohibits market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas. The CFTC has similar authority under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations it has promulgated thereunder with respect to certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas. The FTC also prohibits manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market with respect to sales of commodities, including oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. These agencies have substantial enforcement authority, including the potential ability to impose maximum penalties for violations in excess of $1 million per day for each violation. Following their adoption, the maximum penalties prescribed by these regulations have been subject to annual adjustment for inflation. The FERC has also imposed requirements related to reporting of natural gas sales volumes that may impact the formation of prices indices. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these and other matters may be considered or adopted from time to time. In addition, we rely on our employees, consultants and sub-contractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards. Our failure, or the failure by such individuals, to comply with these or other laws and regulations administered by these agencies could subject us to substantial penalties, and potential liability as described in Part I, Item 1: \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters.\u201d\nWe may not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect our net income and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $365.5 million, approximately $287.3 million of which began to expire in 2018 and will continue to expire in varying amounts through 2037. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of an NOL that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382 of the Code). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5 percent of the corporation\u2019s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation following its recognition of an NOL, utilization of such NOL is subject to an annual limitation, generally determined by multiplying the value of the corporation\u2019s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. However, this annual limitation would be increased under certain circumstances by recognized built-in gains of the corporation existing at the time of the ownership change. In the case of an NOL that arose in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, any unused annual limitation with respect to an NOL generally may be carried over to later years, subject to the expiration of such NOL 20 years after it arose.\nAs a result of our 2019 stock offerings, combined with ownership shifts over the rolling three-year period, we have incurred ownership changes on each of November 19, 2018 and September 12, 2019 pursuant to Section 382, which limits the Company\u2019s future ability to use its NOLs. To the extent we are unable to utilize our NOLs to offset future income or carryback our NOLs to apply against prior tax years, we will be limited in use of NOLs for amounts incurred prior to November 20, 2018 in an amount equal to $2.4 million per year (plus any recognized built in gains during the next five years) or until expiration of each annual vintage of NOL (generally, 20 years for each annual vintage of NOLs incurred prior to 2018). However, the September 2019 ownership change resulted in an annual limitation of approximately $700,000 per year, which has the effect of limiting tax attribute usage from the 2018 ownership change in a similar manner and amount. Due to the presence of the valuation allowance from prior years, this event resulted in a no net charge to earnings. Future changes in our stock ownership or future regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated. Additional state taxes on oil and natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.\nFrom time to time, U.S. lawmakers propose certain changes to U.S. tax laws applicable to oil and natural gas companies. These changes include, but are not limited to: (i) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling\nand development costs; (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or if enacted, when such changes could be effective. If such proposed changes (or the imposition of, or increases in, production, severance or similar taxes) were to be enacted, as well as any similar changes in state, local or non-U.S. law, it could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, future legislation could be enacted that increases the taxes or fees imposed on oil and natural gas extraction. Any such legislation could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products, which in turn could affect the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of our facilities, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays, cancellations or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain permits before commencing drilling or other regulated activities; restrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas, such as wetlands or wilderness areas; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells; and impose substantial penalties for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. We maintain insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages; however, it is possible that coverage might not be sufficient in a catastrophic event. Consequently, we could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages under these laws and regulations, with certain of these legal requirements imposing strict liability for such damages and costs, even though the conduct in pursuing operations was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct resulting in such damage and costs were caused by prior operators or other third parties.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations in the United States are subject to change in the future, including in connection with the change in federal administration in January 2021, which could result in more stringent legal requirements. If existing environmental regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, we may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures with respect to the continued operations of the drilling program.\nCompliance of our operations with these regulations or other laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental and occupational health and safety legal requirements could, among other things, require us to install new or modified emission controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur significantly increased capital or operating expenditures, which costs may be significant. Moreover, any failure of our operations to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against us that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nWe may incur significant environmental cost liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. We currently own, operate or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. For example, an accidental release resulting from the drilling of a well, could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property and natural resource damages as well as monetary fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for these costs and liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of our conduct. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously\ndisposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging or other decommissioning activities to prevent future contamination. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as activities related to fossil fuel extraction on federal properties, generally, and governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA Underground Injection Control program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities, as well as published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also published final rules under the CAA in 2012 and in 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, in 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM also published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in late 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s decision to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances, including as a result of water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability or due to surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water.\nMoreover, from time to time, Congress has considered, but not enacted, legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, certain states, including Texas and Wyoming, where we conduct operations, have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Additionally, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing, as has been the case in Colorado in recent years, when certain interest groups therein have unsuccessfully pursued ballot initiatives in recent general election cycles that, had they been successful, would have revised the state constitution or state statutes in a manner that would have made exploration and production activities in the state more difficult or costly in the future including, for example, by increasing mandatory setback distances of oil and natural gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, from specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally sensitive or recreational areas. Some counties have since amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and natural gas development while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and natural gas producers to accomplish the same objective. Hydraulic fracturing operators in Oklahoma have also been subject to lawsuits alleging that their fracturing activities caused a series of earthquakes in the past several years and that these operators are therefore liable for certain damages caused by the earthquakes. Such lawsuits could cause us to incur liabilities for damages caused by earthquakes or otherwise impact the profitability of our operations in Oklahoma.\nIn the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we currently or in the future plan to operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience restrictions, delays or cancellations in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Similarly, such impacts could result from new restrictions or prohibitions of oil and gas development activities on federal properties. Expectations or uncertainties regarding such restrictions being imposed (whether through the Executive Branch or by statute) could lead to increased volatility in our business plan and in the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to additional supplemental bonding under the BOEM financial assurance requirements.\nEnergy companies conducting oil and natural gas lease operations offshore on the OCS are required by the BSEE, among other obligations, to conduct decommissioning within specified times following cessation of offshore producing activities, which decommissioning includes the plugging of wells, removal of platforms and other facilities and the clearing of obstacles from the lease site sea floor. To cover a lease operator\u2019s decommissioning obligations, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulations or otherwise post bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such future obligations will be satisfied. As an operator, we are required to post surety bonds of $200,000 per individual lease (or a $1,000,000 area-wide bond) for exploration and $500,000 per lease for developmental activities as part of our general bonding requirements, as well as the posting of additional supplemental bonds to cover, among other things, our decommissioning obligations. We typically post surety bonds with the BOEM to satisfy our general and supplemental bonding requirements.\nThe BOEM continues to reconsider the adoption, implementation or enforcement of more stringent financial assurance regulatory initiatives, as well as more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters, all of which could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions, or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore on the federal OCS. In particular, the BOEM issued NTL #2016-N01 that became effective in September 2016 and bolsters the financial assurance requirements offshore lessees on the OCS, including the Gulf of Mexico, must satisfy with respect to their decommissioning obligations. If the BOEM determines under NTL #2016-N01 that a company does not satisfy the minimum requirements to qualify for providing self-insurance to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. However, in 2017, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior issued Order 3350 (\u201cOrder 3350\u201d), which directed the BOEM and the BSEE to reconsider a number of regulatory initiatives governing offshore oil and natural gas safety and performance-related activities, including, for example, NTL #2016-N01, and provide recommendations on whether such regulatory initiatives should continue to be implemented. As a result, the BOEM extended the start date for implementing NTL #2016-N01 indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017. This extension currently remains in effect; however, the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue liability orders in the future, including in the event that it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder\u2019s decommissioning obligations. In October 2020, BOEM and BSEE proposed a new financial assurance rule which removes certain provisions for third-party guarantees and decommissioning accounts and provides criteria for canceling bonds and third-party guarantees. Overall, the agencies expect the rule to reduce the total amount of financial assurance required. However, this rule is not yet finalized, and until the review is completed and the BOEM determines what additional financial assurance may be required by us, we cannot provide assurance that such financial assurance coverage can be obtained. Moreover, the BOEM could make other demands for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under sole liability properties and/or non-sole liability properties.\nIf we fail to comply with any orders of the BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, ordering suspension of operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, under existing BOEM rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interest may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning obligations at those OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by the BOEM, in the event that the assignee or any subsequent assignee is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning. In the event that we, in the role of assignor, receive orders from the BOEM to decommission OCS facilities that one of our assignees or any subsequent assignee of offshore facilities is unwilling or unable to perform, we could incur costs to perform those decommissioning obligations, which costs could be material.\nThe BSEE has implemented stringent controls and reporting requirements that if not followed, could result in significant monetary penalties or a shut-in of all or a portion of our Gulf of Mexico operations.\nThe BSEE is the federal agency responsible for overseeing the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the OCS. Over the past decade, the agency has been responsible for leading aggressive and comprehensive reforms regarding regulation and oversight of the offshore oil and natural gas industry. These reforms have resulted in more stringent offshore requirements including, for example, well and blowout preventer design, workplace safety and corporate accountability. However, as a result of the issuance of Order 3350 in 2017, the BSEE continues to reconsider certain regulations or regulatory initiatives governing offshore oil and natural gas safety and performance-related activities. For example, in December 2017, the BSEE proposed, and in September\n2018 it finalized, revisions to its regulations regarding offshore drilling safety equipment, which revisions include the removal of an obligation for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment (e.g., subsea safety equipment, including blowout preventers) is operational and functioning as designed in the most extreme conditions. Subsequently, on May 2, 2019, BSEE issued the 2019 Well Control Rule, the revised well control and blowout preventer rule governing Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activities. The new rule revised the then existing regulations impacting offshore oil and natural gas drilling, completions, workovers, and decommissioning activities. Specifically, the 2019 Well Control Rule addresses six areas of offshore operations: well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment. The revisions were targeted to ensure safety and environmental protection while correcting errors in the 2016 rule and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.\nAdditionally, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizes and requires the BSEE to provide for both an annual scheduled inspection and periodic unscheduled (unannounced) inspections of all oil and natural gas operations on the OCS. In addition to examining all safety equipment designed to prevent blowouts, fires, spills or other major accidents, the inspections focus on pollution, drilling operations, completions, workovers, production and pipeline safety. Upon detecting an alleged violation, the inspector typically issues an Incident of Noncompliance (\u201cINC\u201d) to the operator that, depending on the severity of such violation, either serves as a warning to address such violation or requires a shut-in of a facility component or of the entire facility until such time as the violation is corrected. The warning INC is issued for a less severe or threatened condition and must be corrected within a reasonable amount of time, as specified on the INC, whereas the shut-in INC is for more serious conditions that must be corrected before the operator is allowed to resume the activity in question.\nIn addition to the enforcement actions specified above, the BSEE can assess civil penalties if: (i) the operator fails to correct the violation in the reasonable amount of time specified on the INC; or (ii) the violation resulted in a threat of serious harm or damage to human life or the environment. In January 2018, the BSEE published a final rule that increased the maximum civil penalty rate for Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act violations to $43,576 a day for each violation. Operators with excessive INCs may be required to cease operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf conditions that impact demand for and supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, domestically and globally;\n\u25cf future announcements concerning our business;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf changes in government and environmental regulation;\n\u25cf general market, economic and political conditions, domestically and globally;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf sales of common stock by us, our significant stockholders or members of our management team; and\n\u25cf natural disasters, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks and acts of war.\nAverage oil and natural gas prices declined dramatically beginning in early 2015 and have remained relatively low since then, with oil prices reaching historic lows in April 2020 due, in part, to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This decline in commodity prices and stock market volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including, among other things, an exemption from the requirement to present five years of selected financial data, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and being subject to simplified executive compensation disclosures. Until such time as we cease to be a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d such reduced disclosure in our SEC filings may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce disclosure we may make, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.\nOur board of directors presently intends to retain all of our earnings for the expansion of our business; therefore, we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Also, the provisions of our Credit Agreement restrict the payment of dividends. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder action, to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to designate the dividend rate, voting rights and other rights, preferences and restrictions of each such series. We are authorized to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. Also, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 19,847 stock options to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which were fully vested.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur bylaws provide certain limitations with respect to business combinations with affiliated stockholders, which may discourage transactions that would otherwise be preferred by a stockholder.\nWe have elected not to be governed by Texas business combination law, which prohibits a publicly held Texas corporation from engaging in a business combination with an affiliated shareholder for a period of three years after the affiliated shareholder\u2019s share acquisition date, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Our bylaws, however, provide that, subject to certain exceptions, we shall not engage in any business combination (as defined in our bylaws) with any \u201caffiliated stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an affiliated stockholder, unless:\n\u25cf prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an affiliated stockholder;\n\u25cf upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an affiliated stockholder, the affiliated stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting common stock outstanding, excluding shares held by certain directors who are also officers;\n\u25cf at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the affirmative vote of (i) our board of directors and (ii) the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of our outstanding voting common stock not owned by the affiliated stockholder or an affiliate or associate of the affiliated stockholder, at a meeting of stockholders called for that purpose not less than six months after the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an affiliated stockholder; or\n\u25cf at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by (i) a majority of the directors of our board who are not the affiliated stockholder (or an affiliate or associate thereof, or nominated for election by such affiliated stockholder) and were a member of our board on or prior to June 14, 2019 or were elected or nominated for election by a majority of directors who were members of our board on or prior to June 14, 2019, and (ii) a majority of our voting common stock outstanding.\nFor purposes of this provision, \u201caffiliated stockholder\u201d means any person that is the owner of 20% or more of the voting common stock outstanding or, during the preceding three-year period, was the owner of 20% or more of our voting common stock outstanding; provided, however, that \u201caffiliated stockholder\u201d does not include certain stockholders whose aggregate ownership does not exceed 23% of our voting common stock outstanding, subject to adjustment by our board of directors. This provision has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock. This provision may also have the effect of limiting financing transactions with interested stockholders that could be deemed favorable sources of capital. With the approval of 2/3 of our board of directors or our stockholders, this provision of our bylaws could be amended to further provide antitakeover protection. In addition, with approval of our board of directors and a majority of stockholders, we could change our state of incorporation and modify the antitakeover provisions applicable to us, or we could amend our certificate of incorporation in the future to elect to be governed by the Texas business combination law.\nCertain antitakeover provisions may affect your rights as a shareholder.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to set the terms of and issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. Our board of directors could use the preferred stock as a means to delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in our best interest. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains terms that may restrict our ability to enter into change of control transactions, including requirements to repay borrowings under our Credit Agreement. These provisions, along with specified provisions of the TBOC and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, may discourage or impede transactions involving actual or potential changes in our control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88871, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MCF"}
