RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors listed in this section and other factors noted herein could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements or could result in a significant or material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 AND OTHER POTENTIAL PANDEMICS, HEALTH CRISES, CLIMATE CHANGE, SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS\nOur business could be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, severe weather conditions or the occurrence of another catastrophic event.\nThe U.S. and other countries continue to experience an outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and created significant volatility and disruptions of financial markets. In response, the U.S. government and its agencies have taken a number of significant measures to provide fiscal and monetary stimulus, and authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus. These measures have impacted and may continue to impact the Company\u2019s workforce and operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the Company believes is in the best interests of its employees. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company's future operations will depend on uncertain developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic (including any of its variants), as well as uncertainty regarding the effects of government measures already taken, and which may be taken or continued in the future, to combat the spread of the virus and any of its variants, and/or provide additional economic stimulus. This situation is continually changing, and additional impacts may arise that the Company is not aware of currently. It is not currently possible to predict the extent that COVID-19 will impact the Company's financial position or results of operation, although it is possible that it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nClimate change, extreme weather conditions and catastrophic events, such as future pandemic diseases, natural disasters and terrorist attacks, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business operations could be impacted, including availability of key Company personnel or the Company\u2019s information technology systems, by volatility of real estate prices, significant climate migration, and disruptions to the real estate environment or financial markets. Given the unpredictable nature of these events with respect to size, severity, duration and geographic location, it is not currently possible to quantify the ultimate impact that they may have on the Company\u2019s business.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS\nAdverse changes in economic conditions, especially those related to real estate activity, may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe demand for the Company\u2019s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services varies from year to year and is dependent upon, among other factors, the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions and mortgage financing transactions. The volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as the overall state of the economy, the average price level of real estate sales, housing inventory, and the availability and pricing of mortgage financing. Real estate activity generally decreases when the economy is weak or uncertain, home prices are increasing, housing inventory is limited, the availability of mortgage credit is limited, or mortgage interest rates are increasing. The cyclical nature of the Company\u2019s business has caused volatility in revenue and profitability in the past and could do so in the future.\nDemand for title insurance also depends in part upon the requirement by mortgage lenders and other participants in the secondary mortgage market that title insurance policies be obtained on residential and commercial real property.\nThe Company may experience material losses resulting from fraud, defalcation or misconduct.\nUnderwriting agents and approved settlement providers, which can include issuing agents and approved attorneys, perform a significant portion of the work necessary to issue the Company\u2019s title insurance policies. These agents and providers operate with a substantial degree of independence from the Company, subject to certain contractual limitations. As a result, the Company\u2019s use of title agents and approved providers could result in claims on the Company\u2019s policies and other expenses due to fraud and negligence. Fraud, defalcation, errors and other misconduct by the Company\u2019s agents, approved attorneys and employees are risks inherent in the Company\u2019s business. Agents and approved attorneys typically handle large sums of money in trust pursuant to the closing of real estate transactions. Misappropriation of funds by any of these parties could result in title claims, some of which could be large and have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies upon the North Carolina, Texas, Georgia and South Carolina markets for a significant portion of its premiums. Changes in the economic or regulatory environments in these states could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nNorth Carolina, Texas, Georgia and South Carolina are the largest sources of premium revenue for the Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries. In 2021, these states represented 36.1%, 22.8%, 12.6% and 9.1% of total premiums written by the Company, respectively. A decrease in the level of real estate activity in these states, whether driven by weak economic conditions, changes in regulatory environments or other factors that influence demand, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nAdverse deviation of actual claims experience from expected claims experience will result in lower net earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s net income is affected by the extent to which its actual claims experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing the reserve for claims. The reserve for claims is established based on actuarial estimates of future payments for reported claims, as well as claims which have been incurred but not yet reported. In addition, management considers factors such as the Company\u2019s historical claims experience, case reserve estimates on reported claims, large claims and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims.\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the estimation of the reserve for claims, the Company cannot determine precisely the amounts which it will ultimately pay to settle its claims. Factors contributing to the complexity in establishing reserves can include varying loss potentials, timing, unfavorable market or economic conditions and the legal environment. The timing of claims is difficult to estimate as payments may not occur until well into the future. Higher levels of defaults and foreclosures upon insured properties are more prevalent in times of unfavorable economic conditions and can lead to an increase in title insurance claims. The Company may also incur higher than normal claim payment experience or large losses. To the extent that actual claims experience is greater than estimated, the Company could be required to increase the reserve.\nCompetition affects the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe title insurance industry is highly competitive with only a few insurers comprising a large percentage of the market. Key competitive factors are quality of service, price within regulatory parameters, expertise, timeliness and the financial strength and size of the insurer. Title insurance underwriters compete for premiums by choosing various distribution channels which may include company-owned operations, independent agents and agency relationships with real estate attorneys, subsidiaries of community and regional lending institutions, realtors, builders and other settlement service providers. Title insurance underwriters compete for agents on the basis of service, technology and commission levels. Some title insurers currently have greater financial resources, larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and information than the Company. The number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the Company operates, and any reductions to current regulatory barriers within any of the different geographic areas could increase the number of competitors entering into the title insurance market. Competition among the major providers of title insurance or the acceptance of alternative products to traditional title products by the regulatory authorities and the marketplace could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may encounter difficulties managing growth, which could adversely affect its operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth plans involve expansion into new geographic locations and further penetration into established markets through new or existing agents, or through acquisitions. Such growth may subject the Company to associated risks, such as diverting management\u2019s attention, incurring unanticipated liabilities from an acquired business, difficulty integrating an acquired entity, or retaining its employees or customers and realization of synergies. The occurrence of any of these risks may deprive the Company of some or all of the anticipated value of an acquisition or other growth initiatives, resulting in lower returns on investments and result in a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. These risks could be particularly significant if the Company incurs significant costs in pursuing an acquisition or other initiatives.\nThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and agents, and its inability to do so could adversely affect its business.\nCompetition for skilled and experienced personnel in the Company\u2019s industry is high, and the success of the Company is substantially dependent on its ability to attract and retain such personnel. The Company may have difficulty hiring and retaining the necessary marketing and management personnel to support future growth plans. Also, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining new agents.\nMortgage lending is highly concentrated and changes in relationships with lenders or reform of government-sponsored entities could adversely affect the Company.\nRefusal by major market lenders to accept the Company\u2019s product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, government-sponsored entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), often require the purchase of title insurance for home loans they securitize. The federal government has had discussions about the possible reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Changes to these entities could impact the entire mortgage loan process and as a result, could impact the demand for title insurance. The timing and results of reform are currently unknown; however, changes to these entities could adversely impact the Company and its results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic or other conditions could cause the Company to record impairment charges for all or a portion of its goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs a result of acquisition activity, the Company has goodwill and other intangible assets that comprise approximately 4.8% of total assets as of December 31, 2021. Quarterly, the Company performs an impairment analysis that reviews changes in events or circumstances that could lead to the carrying value not being recoverable. Economic downturns or poor performance of the acquisitions could result in the Company recognizing an impairment of a portion or all of the goodwill and intangible assets on the Company\u2019s books and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE MATTERS\nThe Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex government regulations. Changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulations that are intended to protect policyholders and consumers.\nThe Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations by the CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has extensive regulatory and enforcement authority over real estate and mortgage markets, including RESPA, the primary federal regulatory guidance governing the real estate settlement industry. The manner and extent to which the CFPB will implement new regulations is not fully known; however, any new regulations implemented could result in changes to internal processes, including changes to systems and forms.\nIn addition to federal regulation, title insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations. The nature and extent of state regulations, which vary from state to state, typically involve, among other matters, licensing and renewal requirements and trade and marketing practices, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022licensing of insurers and agents;\n\u2022capital and surplus requirements;\n\u2022approval, regulation or establishment of premium rates for insurance;\n\u2022limitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u2022limitations on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company;\n\u2022filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition;\n\u2022the amount of dividends and other payments made by insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022establishing reserves;\n\u2022accounting and financing practices;\n\u2022deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022trade and marketing practices;\n\u2022regulation of reinsurance;\n\u2022approval of policy forms; and\n\u2022use of personal information, including cybersecurity regulations.\nInsurance holding companies are subject to periodic examinations and the regulation of acquisitions, intercompany transactions and changes in control, among other regulations, by state regulators.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain federal regulations established by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Federal Reserve and various other governmental agencies.\nThe Company\u2019s other businesses also operate within state and federal guidelines. Any changes in the regulatory environment could restrict its existing or future operations and could possibly make it more burdensome and costly to conduct them.\nNew regulations, or differing interpretations of existing laws, could change business processes, products and services and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nA downgrade from a rating agency could result in a loss of underwriting business.\nThe competitive positions of title insurance companies rely partly on ratings published by independent rating services. Government-sponsored entities and lending institutions utilize these ratings, among other items, to evaluate a title insurer\u2019s strength and stability. The Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries are currently rated by A.M. Best Company and Demotech, Inc. The ratings issued by independent rating agencies are not credit ratings, but represent the opinion of the individual rating agency regarding the title insurance subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet policyholder obligations. These insurer ratings are subject to periodic review and there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries will maintain their current respective ratings. A significant downgrade in the ratings of either of the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries could negatively impact the ability to compete for new business, retain existing business and maintain the necessary licenses to operate as title insurance companies in various states.\nTitle insurance rate regulation could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRates for title insurance vary by state and are subject to extensive regulation. Statutes generally provide that rates must not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. The process of implementing a rate change in most states involves pre-approval by the applicable state insurance regulator. This regulation could impact the Company\u2019s ability to adjust prices in the face of rapidly changing market conditions, which could adversely affect results of operations.\nRegulatory investigations of the title insurance industry by governmental entities could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe title insurance industry is subject to scrutiny by both federal and state regulators focusing on violations of state insurance codes, RESPA and similar state and federal laws, among others. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries occasionally receive inquiries from regulators involving market conduct. Future inquiries could lead to fines for violations, settlements with regulating authorities that could result in fines or requirements to pay claims, and the potential for further regulation. The results of future inquiries could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on distributions from its insurance subsidiaries.\nThe Company is an insurance holding company and it has no substantial operations of its own. Its principal assets are investments in its operating subsidiaries, primarily its insurance subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations is dependent, among other factors, on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay intercompany loans. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends, loans or advances they may make to the Company. The restriction on these amounts is based on the amount of the insurance subsidiaries\u2019 unassigned surplus and net income, with certain adjustments. Additionally, these subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital, surplus and reserves. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $117.9 million of consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity represented the net assets of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries that cannot be transferred in the form of dividends, loans or advances to the Company. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \u201cextraordinary\u201d and require prior approval by the appropriate regulatory body. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends may be constrained by business considerations, such as the impact of dividends on insurer ratings or competitive position. These dividend restrictions could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or fund growth opportunities.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS AND DEPOSITS\nDeterioration in financial markets may cause a decline in the performance of the Company\u2019s investments and could have a material adverse impact on net income.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its income from its investment portfolio that primarily includes fixed maturity securities and equity securities. The Company\u2019s investment policy is designed to comply with regulatory requirements and to balance the competing objectives of asset quality and investment returns. The Company\u2019s investment portfolio is subject to risk from changes in general economic conditions, prices of marketable fixed maturity securities and equity securities, interest rates, liquidity, credit markets, and other external factors. The risk of loss is increased during periods of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets as these factors could limit the ability of some issuers to repay their debt obligations.\nFixed maturity securities and equity securities are carried at estimated fair value on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. If the carrying value of the Company\u2019s fixed maturity securities exceeds the estimated fair value, and the decline in estimated fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company will be required to write down the value of its investments. Unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as changes in the estimated fair value of equity security investments, without regard as to whether a decline in value is deemed to be temporary or other-than-temporary. Changes in the estimated fair value of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial institution failures could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company has substantial deposits with financial institutions, including fiduciary deposits that are owned by third parties. There is no guarantee the Company, whether through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or otherwise, would recover the funds it has deposited should one or more of the financial institutions at which the Company maintains deposits fail.\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY, TECHNOLOGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nBreaches and failures of, and other disruptions to, the Company\u2019s information technology systems may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, result in monetary losses and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company relies on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for a wide range of activities involved in the delivery of its products and services, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022process title insurance applications and policy issuances;\n\u2022perform due diligence on land titles;\n\u2022manage substantial cash, investment assets, bank deposits, trust assets and escrow account balances on behalf of the Company and its customers;\n\u2022manage billing, collections and payables, including insurance premiums and agent commissions;\n\u2022manage accounting and financial reporting; and\n\u2022manage payroll and human resources information.\nThe Company\u2019s IT systems may be disrupted or fail, and information stolen or otherwise misappropriated, for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyberattacks;\n\u2022software \u201cbugs\u201d, hardware defects or human error;\n\u2022natural disasters, like fires, or pandemics; or\n\u2022power loss.\nAny of these events could disrupt operations both internally and externally, which may result in the loss of revenues. These events could also result in the unauthorized release of proprietary and/or non-public information, or even defalcation of corporate or client funds.\nLike all companies, the Company\u2019s IT systems have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of computer viruses, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other malicious activity. For example, during the third quarter of 2021, the Company detected a ransomware attack limited to one entity that required a temporary interruption to the impacted entity\u2019s computer network as the issue was being remediated. Promptly upon detection, the Company launched an investigation and initiated response protocols, including the engagement of external cybersecurity professionals and legal counsel. Based on the information developed in the course of the investigation, the ransomware attack has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's business, financial position and results of operations. While the Company has not experienced a known material breach to date, the occurrence or scope of such events is not always immediately apparent and there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer additional attacks or incur more serious financial consequences or expense in the future. The Company invests resources in maintaining the security of its systems and adapting to evolving security threats. There is, however, no guarantee that its security measures will be adequate to prevent all cyberattacks. There is similarly no guarantee that the Company\u2019s backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and the Company may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies. The Company\u2019s reputation may also be damaged in the event of a serious IT breach or failure. Furthermore, as technology develops, and as cybercriminals become more capable, the difficulty and expense of maintaining IT security and redundancy may increase.\nTo the extent the Company\u2019s IT systems store non-public personal information, and information about its employees, security breaches may expose the Company to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. Non-public personal information may include, but is not limited to, names, addresses, social security numbers, and banking information.\nFurthermore, the Company is required by law and by certain contracts, particularly contracts with financial institutions, to notify various parties, consumers and customers in the event that confidential or personal information may have been or was accessed by unauthorized third parties. Such an event could potentially result in a breach of contract, and any required notifications could result in, among other things, the loss of customers, negative publicity, distraction of management, fines, lawsuits for breach of contract, regulatory inquiries or involvement and a decline in sales.\nThe Company seeks to mitigate the financial risk associated with unauthorized disclosure of non-public information by maintaining cyber liability insurance coverage. As cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to insure against cyberattacks have risen and may continue to rise in the future.\nThe Company may encounter difficulties managing system or technological changes, which could adversely affect its financial and operating results.\nTechnological changes in the title insurance industry are driven primarily by evolution in technology, competitive factors and regulatory changes. These changes have resulted in faster information delivery and efficient, highly automated production processes. The inability of the Company to manage, develop or successfully implement new systems or technological changes could negatively impact profitability.\nPolicies and procedures for the mitigation of risk may not be sufficient.\nThe Company has policies and procedures in place to help identify, analyze, and measure the risks associated with the issuance of title insurance policies, investment risks, interest rate risks and legal risks, among others. In evaluating risks, the Company considers enterprise risk management, information technology risk management, disaster recovery, business continuity, and vendor risk management. Because a significant degree of judgment is involved with the establishment of policies and processes as well as the measurement of risks, it is possible not all risks have been identified or anticipated. Misidentified or unanticipated risks could adversely impact the Company and its results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK\nCertain provisions in the Company\u2019s organizational law, North Carolina law, organizational documents, and the Company\u2019s shareholder rights plan may deter or discourage a takeover of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cArticles\u201d) and amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d contain certain provisions that could delay, prevent or discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that may involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the Company\u2019s common shareholders. In addition, the Company has adopted a shareholder rights plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). The provisions in the Company\u2019s organizational documents and the rights set forth in the Plan are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company, and the Company believes these protective measures are beneficial to the Company and its shareholders in the event of negotiations with a potential acquirer. These provisions are described in further detail in \u201cDescription of the Company\u2019s Securities\u201d incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company\u2019s Bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state courts of North Carolina will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company\u2019s and its shareholders.\nThe Bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in the name or right of the Company or on its behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of Company to the Company or its shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the \u201cNCBCA\u201d), the Articles, or the Bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of the Articles or the Bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, including, without limitation, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Articles or the Bylaws, shall be the state courts of North Carolina in and for Orange County, North Carolina, subject to designation or assignment to the North Carolina Business Court (or, if no state court located within the State of North Carolina has jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina). The Bylaws also provide that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the provisions described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, and (b) unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against the Company or any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company and arising under the Securities Act (however, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision, and investors cannot waive compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder). The choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees and may also result in increased costs for shareholders to bring any such claim, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers, and other employees.\nIf a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if the Company is successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.", "PERMNO": 10901, "SIC": 6361, "TIC": "ITIC"}
