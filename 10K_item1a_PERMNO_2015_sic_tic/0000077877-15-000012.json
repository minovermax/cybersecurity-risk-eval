RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate and a decline in these prices can significantly affect the value of our assets and our financial results and impede our growth.\nOur revenue, profitability, cash flows and liquidity depend in large part upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Changes in prices affect many aspects of our business, including:\n\u2022\nour revenue, profitability and cash flows;\n\u2022\nour liquidity;\n\u2022\nthe quantity and present value of our reserves;\n\u2022\nthe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and access to other sources of capital; and\n\u2022\nthe nature and scale of our operations.\nThe markets for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are often volatile, and prices may fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u2022\nrelatively minor changes in regional, national or global supply and demand;\n\u2022\nregional, national or global economic conditions, and perceived trends in those conditions;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical factors, such as events that may reduce or increase production from particular oil-producing regions and/or from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; and\n\u2022\nregulatory changes.\nThe price of oil fell significantly in the second half of 2014, from a high of $107.26 per barrel in June to a low of $53.27 per barrel in December, in each case based on WTI prices, due to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply, global economic concerns and a decision by OPEC not to reduce supply. This decline has adversely affected, among other things, our revenue and reserves, and has caused us to reduce our budgeted 2015 capital program relative to 2014 and contributed to the recognition of an impairment charge of $158.3 million to write-down our Utica Shale producing and non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties to their estimated fair value. An extended period of continued lower oil prices, or additional price declines, will have further adverse effects on us.\nIn addition to factors affecting the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs generally, the prices we receive for our production are affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. The prices that we receive for our production are generally lower than the relevant benchmark prices that are used for calculating commodity derivative positions. These differences, or differentials, are difficult to predict and may widen or narrow in the future based on market forces. Differentials can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors and the terms of our sales contracts. Over the longer term, differentials will be significantly affected by factors such as investment decisions made by providers of midstream facilities and services, refineries and other industry participants, and the overall regulatory and economic climate. For example, increases in U.S. domestic oil production generally may result in widening differentials, particularly for production from some basins. We may be materially and adversely impacted by widening differentials on our production.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities the capacity and operation of which we do not control. Market conditions or operational impediments, including high line pressures, particularly in the Wattenberg Field, and other impediments affecting midstream facilities and services, could hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and NGL markets, increase our costs or delay production and thereby adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. If adequate midstream facilities and services are not available to us on a timely basis and at acceptable costs, our production and results of operations will be adversely affected. These risks are greater for us than for some of our competitors because our operations are focused on areas where there is currently a substantial amount of development activity, which increases the likelihood that there will be periods of time in which there is insufficient midstream capacity to accommodate the resulting increases in production. For example, due to ongoing drilling activities by us and third parties, and hot temperatures during the summer months, the principal third-party provider we use in the Wattenberg area for midstream facilities and services experiences increased gathering system pressures during those warmer months. The resulting capacity constraints typically reduce the productivity of some of our older vertical wells and may on occasion limit incremental production from some of our newer horizontal wells. This constrains our production and reduces our revenue from the affected wells. Capacity constraints affecting natural gas production also impact the associated NGLs. We are also dependent on the availability and capacity of crude oil purchasers for our production. For example, reductions in purchases by a local crude oil refinery beginning in late 2013 increased the amount of oil that we had to transport out of the Wattenberg area for sale. This increased our transportation costs and reduced the price we received for the affected production for much of 2014. We expect this situation could occur again in the future. In addition, the use of alternative forms of transportation such as trucks or rail involve risks. For example, well-publicized accidents involving trains delivering crude oil could result in increased levels of regulation and transportation costs, and possibly shortages of railcars that meet new safety standards. We face similar risks in other areas, including our Utica operating area, as gathering/processing infrastructure is currently in the development phase and development activity has increased in recent years. In addition to causing p\nroduction curtailments, capacity constraints can also reduce the price we receive for the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce.\nA substantial part of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production is located in the Wattenberg Field, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing formations.\nOur operations are focused primarily on the Wattenberg Field, which means our current producing properties and new drilling opportunities are geographically concentrated in that area. Approximately $435 million, or 92%, of our 2015 capital program forecast is expected to be spent on development activities in the Wattenberg Field. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the wells in the area;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as the flooding that occurred in the area in September 2013;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental regulations; and\n\u2022\ncurtailment of production or interruption in the availability of gathering, processing or transportation infrastructure and services, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nFor example, recent increases in activity in the Wattenberg Field have contributed to bottlenecks in processing and transportation that have negatively affected our results of operations, and these adverse effects may be disproportionately severe to us compared to our more geographically diverse competitors. Similarly, the concentration of our assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules, that could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in areas where exploration and production activities are increasing, as has been the case in recent years in the Wattenberg Field, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services increase. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs, additional drilling and operating restrictions or delays in the production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and could prohibit hydraulic fracturing activities.\nMost of our drilling uses hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional wells in shale, coalbed, and tight sand formations. Proposals have been introduced in the U.S. Congress to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations and related injection of fracturing fluids and propping agents used by the crude oil and natural gas industry in fracturing fluids under the Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d), and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process under the SDWA, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (\u201cEPCRA\u201d), or other laws. Sponsors of these bills, which have been subject to various proceedings in the legislative process, including in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and otherwise cause adverse environmental impacts. In March 2011, the EPA announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. EPA issued an initial report about the study in December 2012. The initial report described the focus of the continuing study but did not include any data concerning EPA\u2019s efforts to date, nor did it draw any conclusions about the safety of hydraulic fracturing. A draft of the report is expected in 2015 and a final, peer reviewed report is expected in 2016.\nEPA has begun a Toxic Substances Control Act rulemaking which will collect expansive information on the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluid, as well as other health-related data, from chemical manufacturers and processors. EPA has not indicated when it intends to issue a proposed rule, but it issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2014, seeking public comment on a variety of issues related to the rulemaking. Concurrently, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices.\nEPA also finalized major new CAA standards (New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) applicable to hydraulically fractured natural gas wells and certain storage vessels in August 2012. The standards require, among other things, use of reduced emission completions, or green completions, to reduce volatile organic compound emissions during well completions as well as new controls applicable to a wide variety of storage tanks and other equipment, including compressors, controllers, and dehydrators. Following administrative reconsideration of a portion of the 2012 rules, EPA issued one set of final amendments to the rule in September 2013 related to storage tanks, and a second set of final amendments largely related to reduced emissions completion requirements in December 2014. Most key provisions in the new CAA standards become effective in 2015. The rules and associated amendments are substantial and will increase future costs of our operations and will require us to make modifications to our operations and install new equipment. In January 2015, EPA announced a comprehensive strategy to further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. EPA\u2019s hybrid approach will rely partly on voluntary measures and partly on regulatory requirements. A proposed rule is expected in 2015, with a final rule to be issued in 2016. Potential new requirements under such rules could include, but are not limited to, new leak detection and repair standards, control requirements at oil well completions, replacement of certain pneumatic pumps, and additional control requirements for gathering,\nboosting, and compressor stations. These additional methane reduction requirements could increase future costs of our operations and require us to make modifications to our operations and install new equipment.\nEPA has also issued permitting guidance under the SDWA for the underground injection of liquids from hydraulically fractured (and other) wells where diesel is used. Depending upon how it is implemented, this guidance may create duplicative requirements in certain areas, further slow down the permitting process in certain areas, increase the costs of operations, and result in expanded regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities by EPA and may therefore adversely affect even companies, such as PDC, that do not use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain other federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Most notably, the U.S. Department of the Interior, through the BLM, is currently conducting a rulemaking that will require, among other things, disclosure of chemicals and more stringent well integrity measures associated with hydraulic fracturing operations on public land. The rule is in its final stages and BLM is expected to issue the rule in 2015.\nIn addition, the governments of certain states, including Colorado and Ohio, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that impose or could impose, among other requirements, stringent permitting or air emission control requirements, disclosure, wastewater disposal, baseline sampling, seismic monitoring, well construction and well location requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban underground injection of fracturing wastewater or fracturing activities altogether. For example, in January 2012, the ODNR issued a temporary moratorium on the development of hydraulic fracturing disposal wells in northeast Ohio in order to study the relationship between these wells and minor earthquakes reported in the area. As a result, ODNR promulgated new and more stringent regulations for certain underground injection wells, including requirements for a complete suite of geophysical logs, analytical interpretation of the logs, and enhanced monitoring and recording. More recently, in April 2014, ODNR shut down a number of well sites after a series of small earthquakes in northeast Ohio. After investigating the earthquakes and determining that the connection to hydraulic fracturing was \u201cprobable,\u201d ODNR implemented new permit conditions, requiring that operators of well sites within three miles of a known fault must install sensitive seismic-monitoring equipment. Operators must also halt drilling if a seismic event exceeds 1.0 magnitude. New York has also placed a permanent moratorium on all hydraulic fracturing activities within the state. Similar initiatives could spread to states in which we operate.\nAt the local level, some municipalities and local governments have adopted or are considering bans on hydraulic fracturing. Voters in the cities of Fort Collins, Boulder, and Lafayette, Colorado recently approved bans of varying length on hydraulic fracturing within their respective city limits. The bans in Longmont, Lafayette, and Fort Collins were overturned by local district courts; the Boulder and Broomfield moratoria remain in place, and the Boulder County moratorium was recently extended to 2018. The Longmont City Council has appealed the district court\u2019s decision to overturn the ban, and Fort Collins is appealing that court decision as well. Municipal bans on oil and gas development in New York were upheld in 2014 by the New York Court of Appeals. Voters in Youngstown and Bowling Green, Ohio considered bans on hydraulic fracturing, though the votes in late 2013 and early 2014 were rejected. The town of Oberlin, Ohio passed a ban on hydraulic fracturing, and other voter initiatives may seek to ban hydraulic fracturing as well. Such bans, if successful, could increase the costs of our operations, impact our profitability, and even prevent us from drilling in certain locations.\nIn addition, lawsuits have been filed against unrelated third parties in several states, including Colorado and Ohio, and several other states alleging contamination of drinking water by hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to crude oil, natural gas and NGL production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation, regulation, litigation, or moratoria could also lead to operational delays or lead us to incur increased operating costs in the production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing or other drilling activities. If these legislative, regulatory, litigation, and other initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells or an increase in drilling costs, our profitability could be materially impacted.\nBallot initiatives have been proposed in Colorado that could vastly expand the right of local governments to limit or prohibit oil and natural gas production and development in their jurisdictions and could impose additional regulations on production and development activities. If any initiative or legislation of this nature is implemented and survives legal challenge, additional limitations or prohibitions could be placed on crude oil and natural gas production and development within certain areas of Colorado or the state as a whole. This could adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of development activities in Colorado, particularly those involving hydraulic fracturing, and significantly affect the value of our assets and our financial results and impede our growth.\nCertain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have advanced various options for ballot initiatives aimed at significantly limiting or preventing oil and natural gas development. Signatures for two such proposals were submitted for a vote at the November 2014 election. One proposed to amend the Colorado constitution to establish an \u201cenvironmental bill of rights\u201d that would have allowed local governments in Colorado the right, without limitation, to prohibit crude oil and natural gas development within their respective jurisdictions. The second proposal would have imposed a statewide mandatory minimum spacing, or setback, between oil and gas wells and occupied structures of 2,000 feet. As part of a compromise negotiated by Governor John Hickenlooper, both initiatives were withdrawn prior to the election and were not voted upon. However, these or similar proposals may be made in the future. Should any such proposal be successful and survive legal challenge, it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to drill and/or produce crude oil and natural gas in certain areas in Colorado, or the state generally, and could materially impact our results of operations, production and reserves.\nMoreover, pursuant to the compromise that resulted in the withdrawal of the 2014 proposals, Governor Hickenlooper has created a task force charged with crafting recommendations to help minimize land use and other conflicts relating to the location of oil and gas facilities. The task force has 21 members representing various interests. Recommendations of the task force regarding new or amended legislation must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the members and will be submitted to the Governor by no later than February 27, 2015. We cannot predict the outcome of this process, the proposals to be formulated by the task force or the result of any related legislative process.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to them will be sufficient in preventing them from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn particular, the oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling activities, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and to process and record financial and operating data.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to store, transmit, process and record sensitive information (including trade secrets, employee information and financial and operating data), communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. The complexity of the technologies needed to explore for and develop oil, natural gas and NGLs make certain information more attractive to thieves.\nOur business partners, including vendors, service providers, operating partners, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. Some of these business partners may be provided limited access to our sensitive information or our information systems and related infrastructure in the ordinary course of business.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Certain countries are believed to possess cyber warfare capabilities and are credited with attacks on American companies and government agencies. Well publicized recent cyber-attacks include those directed at Anthem, Inc. and Sony Pictures, but lower profile attacks are also common.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, theft of property or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Given the politically sensitive nature of hydraulic fracturing and the controversy generated by its opponents, our technologies, systems and networks may be of particular interest to certain groups with political agendas, which may seek to launch cyber-attacks as a method of promoting their message. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations. Although to date we have not experienced any significant cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of such attacks in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nEnvironmental and overall public scrutiny focused on the oil and gas industry is increasing. The current trend is to increase regulation of our operations and the industry. We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur exploration, development, production, and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state, and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating, and abandoning crude oil and natural gas wells and associated facilities. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage, and natural resource or other damages. Similar to our competitors, we incur substantial operating and capital costs to comply with such laws and regulations. These compliance costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger companies in the industry which can more easily capture economies of scale with respect to compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations or other operational impediments and subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years-particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing-and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nIn addition, our activities are subject to regulations governing conservation practices, protection of wildlife and habitat, and protection of correlative rights by state governments. For example, the federal Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) and analogous state laws restrict activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitat. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or their habitat in areas where we operate could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in May 2014 proposed a rule to alter how that agency designates critical habitat. It is unclear when that rule may be finalized, but it could expand the reach of the ESA. These regulations affect our operations, increase our costs of exploration and production, and limit the quantity of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce and market. A major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the possibility that we will be unable to obtain needed drilling permits from relevant governmental authorities in a timely manner. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit\nfor a well, or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop our properties.\nAdditionally, the crude oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that substantially increase our financial and managerial compliance costs, increase our exposure to potential damages or limit our activities. At the state level, for instance, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (\u201cCOGCC\u201d) issued a rule in 2013 governing mandatory minimum setbacks between oil and gas wells and occupied buildings and other areas. Also in 2013, the COGCC issued rules that require baseline sampling of certain ground and surface water in most areas of Colorado and impose stringent spill reporting and remediation requirements. These new sampling requirements could increase the costs of developing wells in certain locations. Other regulatory amendments and policies recently adopted by the COGCC address wellbore integrity, hydraulic fracturing, well control, waste management, and spill reporting. In addition to increasing costs of operation, some of these rules and policies could prevent us from drilling wells on certain locations we plan to develop, thereby reducing our reserves as well as our future revenues. In 2014, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act was amended to increase the potential sanctions for violating the Act or its implementing regulations, orders, or permits. In January 2015, the COGCC amended its regulations to implement this new legislation. These legislative and regulatory amendments expand the COGCC\u2019s enforcement authority and tools by, for example, mandating monetary penalties for certain types of violations, requiring a penalty to be assessed for each day of violation, and significantly increasing the maximum daily penalty amount. These changes could significantly increase both the frequency and the amount of future administrative penalties assessed by the COGCC.\nIn addition, in February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s Air Quality Control Commission (\u201cAQCC\u201d) finalized regulations imposing stringent new requirements relating to air emissions from oil and gas facilities in Colorado. The new rules impose significantly more stringent control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements than those required under comparable new federal rules, promulgated at 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart OOOO. In addition, as part of the rule, the AQCC approved the direct regulation of hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the Colorado oil and gas sector. Such state-only, direct regulation of methane (a greenhouse gas) from a single industry sector in the absence of comparable federal regulation is a significant new authority being asserted at the state level and has the potential to adversely affect operations in Colorado as well as in other parts of the country. Along the same lines, local governments are undertaking air quality studies to assess potential public health impacts from oil and gas operations. These studies, in combination with other air quality-related studies that are national in scope, may result in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements on oil and gas operations.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d or the \u201cSuperfund law\u201d) and some comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment This includes potential liability for activities on properties we may currently own or operate upon, but where previous owner/operators caused the release of a hazardous substance. In addition, we may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Regulatory focus on worker safety and health regulations involving operating hazards in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities is also increasing. One example is a recent investigation by OSHA and other governmental authorities regarding potential worker exposure to hydrocarbon vapors from certain fuel transfer and related tasks. Several recent worker fatalities at oil and gas facilities nationwide are being reviewed by OSHA and other governmental authorities for a potential link to hydrocarbon vapor exposure. Regulatory requirements generally relating to worker exposure to hydrocarbon vapors could be increased or receive heightened scrutiny going forward.\nOther potential laws and regulations affecting us include new or increased severance taxes proposed in several states, including Ohio. This could adversely affect our existing operations in the state and the economic viability of future drilling. Additional laws, regulations, or other changes could significantly reduce our future growth, increase our costs of operations, and reduce our cash flows, in addition to undermining the demand for the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). In addition, Colorado has a relatively arid climate and experiences drought conditions from time to time. As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may become limited.\nThe imposition of new environmental initiatives relating to wastewater could restrict our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing. This includes potential restrictions on waste disposal, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of hydrocarbons. For example, in 2010 a petition was filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council with EPA requesting that the agency reassess its prior and long-standing determination that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes would not be regulated as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of the RCRA. EPA has not yet acted on the petition and it remains pending. Were EPA to begin treating some or all of these wastes as \u201chazardous\u201d under Subtitle C in response to the petition, the consequences for our operations would be serious, and would include a significant increase in costs associated with waste treatment and disposal and a potential inability to conduct operations in some instances.\nThe CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge fill and pollutants into regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters of the United States has complicated, and will continue to complicate and increase the cost of, obtaining such permits or other approvals. Most recently, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have issued a proposed rule on defining jurisdictional waters of the United States. An expansive definition of such jurisdictional waters could affect our ability to operate in certain areas, increase costs of operations, and cause significant scrutiny and delays in permitting. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. These permits, in turn, impose far-ranging monitoring, flow control, and other obligations that have generated, and will continue to generate, increased costs for our operations.\nIn October 2011, EPA announced its intention to develop federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. If adopted, the pretreatment rules will require shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transfer to treatment facilities. Proposed rules are expected in early 2015. Some states, including Pennsylvania, have banned the treatment of fracturing wastewater at publicly owned treatment facilities. There has been recent nationwide concern, particularly in Ohio, over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. As seen in Ohio, it is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others.\nFinally, the EPA study noted above has focused and will continue to focus on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that, following the conclusion of EPA\u2019s study, the agency will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. In addition, an inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may adversely impact our business. These water-related concerns are heightened by the potential for flooding events in Colorado such as those that occurred in 2013. For example, during that flood we experienced damage to some of our facilities as well as other operational impediments.\nReduced commodity prices could result in significant impairment charges and significant downward revisions of proved reserves.\nCrude oil prices fell dramatically in the second half of 2014 and the domestic natural gas market remains weak. Low commodity prices could result in, among other adverse effects, significant impairment charges. The cash flow model we use to assess properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management\u2019s estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices, market outlook on forward commodity prices and operating and development costs. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date that the estimate of future cash flows for each producing basin is calculated. However, a significant decrease in long-term forward prices alone could result in a significant impairment for our properties that are sensitive to declines in prices. In December 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of $161.2 million associated with our Piceance Basin proved crude oil and natural gas properties. In 2013, we recognized additional charges of $48.8 million associated with our shallow Upper Devonian (non-Marcellus Shale) Appalachian Basin producing properties. In December 2014, we recognized a charge of $158.3 million associated with our Utica Shale properties. Similar charges could occur in the future. In addition, low commodity prices could result in significant downward revisions to our proved reserves.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our production and reserves, and ultimately our profitability.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated by operations and proceeds from capital markets transactions and the sale of properties. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures utilizing similar financing sources. Our cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022\nthe costs to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties or for any other reason, our need for capital from other sources could increase, and there can be no assurance that such other sources of capital would be available at that time on reasonable terms or at all. If we raise funds by issuing additional equity securities, this would have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. If we raise funds through the incurrence of debt, the risks we face with respect to our indebtedness would increase and we would incur additional interest expense. Our inability to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms would adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nOur estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nCalculating reserves for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs requires subjective estimates of remaining volumes of underground accumulations of hydrocarbons. Assumptions are also made concerning commodity prices, production levels, and operating and development costs over the economic life of the properties. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be inaccurate. Independent petroleum engineers prepare our estimates of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves using pricing, production, cost, tax and other information that we provide. The reserve estimates are based on certain assumptions regarding commodity prices, production levels, and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual results could greatly affect:\n\u2022\nthe economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties;\n\u2022\nfuture depreciation, depletion and amortization (\u201cDD&A\u201d) rates and amounts;\n\u2022\nimpairments in the value of our assets;\n\u2022\nthe classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery;\n\u2022\nestimates of future net cash flows;\n\u2022\ntiming of our capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of funds available for us to utilize under our revolving credit facility.\nSome of our reserve estimates must be made with limited production histories, which renders these reserve estimates less reliable than estimates based on longer production histories. Horizontal drilling in the Wattenberg Field is a relatively recent development, whereas vertical drilling has been used by producers in this field for over 40 years. As a result, the amount of production data from horizontal wells available to reserve engineers is relatively small, and future reserve estimates will be affected by additional production data as it becomes available. Horizontal drilling in the Utica Shale has an even more limited history, particularly in the southern part of the play where most of our acreage is located. Further, reserve estimates are based on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that are anticipated to be economically recoverable from a given date forward based on economic conditions that exist at that date. The actual quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs recovered will be different than the reserve estimates since they will not be produced under the same economic conditions as used for the reserve calculations. In addition, quantities of probable and possible reserves by definition are inherently more risky than proved reserves and are less likely to be recovered.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 70% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflected our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately $2.3 billion during the five years ending December 31, 2019. The estimated development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade to probable or possible any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nThe present value of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of those reserves. Pursuant to SEC rules, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves, and the estimated quantity of those reserves, were based on the prior 12-month average crude oil and natural gas index prices. However, factors such as actual prices we receive for crude oil and natural gas and hedging instruments, the amount and timing of actual production, the amount and timing of future development costs, the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and changes in governmental regulations or taxation, also affect our actual future net cash flows from our properties. Because market prices for crude oil at the end of 2014 were significantly lower than the average price for the year determined under SEC rules, the estimated quantity and present values of our reserves presented in this report are higher than they would be if we had used year-end oil prices instead. Moreover, the lower year-end prices may be more reflective of future economic conditions.\nThe timing of both our production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor (the rate required by the SEC) we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates currently in effect and risks associated with our properties or the industry in general.\nUnless reserves are replaced as they are produced, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop our identified drilling locations as planned.\nProducing crude oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. The rate of decline may change over time and may exceed our estimates. Our future reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current reserves and to economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, discover or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our future operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified a number of well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ncrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\ndrilling and production costs;\n\u2022\navailability of drilling services and equipment;\n\u2022\ndrilling results;\n\u2022\nlease expirations;\n\u2022\nmidstream constraints;\n\u2022\naccess to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nother factors.\nBecause of these factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential well locations. We reduced our budgeted capital expenditures in 2015 relative to 2014 in response to significant declines in the market price of crude oil, and we expect to drill fewer wells during the year - and none targeting the Utica Shale - as a result. In addition, the number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. Further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties. If these third parties are unwilling to pool their interests with ours, and we are unable to require such pooling on a timely basis or at all, this may limit the total locations we can drill. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. Further, our inventory of drilling projects includes locations in addition to those that we currently classify as proved, probable and possible. The development of and results from these additional projects are more uncertain than those relating to probable and possible locations, and significantly more uncertain than those relating to proved locations.\nThe wells we drill may not yield crude oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities, and productive wells may be less successful than we expect.\nA prospect is a property on which our geologists have identified what they believe, based on available information, to be indications of hydrocarbon-bearing rocks. However, our geologists cannot know conclusively prior to drilling and testing whether crude oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present in sufficient quantities to repay drilling or completion costs and generate a profit given the available data and technology. Furthermore, even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques do not enable our geologists to be certain as to whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures or the quantity of the hydrocarbons. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur greater drilling and testing expenses as a result of such expenditures, which may result in a reduction in our returns or losses. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline. If a well is determined to be dry or uneconomic, which can occur even though it contains some crude oil, natural gas or NGLs, it is classified as a dry hole and must be plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable regulations. This generally results in the loss of the entire cost of drilling and completion to that point, the cost of plugging, and lease costs associated with the prospect. Even wells that are completed and placed into production may not produce sufficient crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to be profitable, or they may be less productive and/or profitable than we expected. If we drill a dry hole or unprofitable well on a current or future prospect, the profitability of our operations will decline and the value of our properties will likely be reduced. These risks are greater in developing areas such as the Utica Shale. Exploratory drilling is typically subject to substantially greater risk than development drilling. In addition, initial results from a well are not necessarily indicative of its performance over a longer period.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling can be unprofitable, not only due to dry holes, but also due to curtailments, delays or cancellations as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\npressures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nfloods;\n\u2022\nloss of well control;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services;\n\u2022\nunanticipated environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory penalties. For example, a loss of containment of hydrocarbons during drilling activities could potentially subject us to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of substantial costs, including for environmental remediation, depending upon the circumstances of the loss of containment, the nature and scope of the loss and the applicable laws and regulations. We maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from operations; however, insurance against certain operational risks may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risks presented. For example, we may not have coverage with respect to a pollution event if we are unaware of the event while it is occurring and are therefore unable to report the occurrence of the event to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. Thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or for amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance and/or governmental or third party responses to an event could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently involved in various remedial and investigatory activities at some of our wells and related sites.\nOur business strategy focuses on production in our liquid-rich and high impact shale plays. In this regard, we plan to allocate our capital to an active horizontal drilling program. Historically, most of the wells we drilled were vertical wells. Since 2012, however, we have devoted the majority of our capital budget to drilling horizontal wells. Drilling horizontal wells is technologically more difficult than drilling vertical wells - including as a result of risks relating to our ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages and to successfully run casing the length of the well bore - and the risk of failure is therefore greater than the risk involved in drilling vertical wells. Additionally, drilling a horizontal well is typically far costlier than drilling a vertical well. This means that the risks of our drilling program will be spread over a smaller number of wells, and that, in order to be economic, each horizontal well will need to produce at a higher level in order to cover the higher drilling costs. In addition, we have transitioned to the use of multi-well pads instead of single-well sites. The use of multi-well pad drilling increases some operational risks because problems affecting the pad or a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. Pad drilling can also make our overall production, and therefore our revenue and cash flows, more volatile, because production from multiple wells on a pad will typically commence simultaneously. While we believe that we will be better served by drilling horizontal wells using multi-well pads, the risk component involved in such drilling will be increased in some respects, with the result that we might find it more difficult to achieve economic success in our drilling program.\nUnder the \u201csuccessful efforts\u201d accounting method that we use, unsuccessful exploratory wells must be expensed in the period when they are determined to be non-productive, which reduces our net income in such periods and could have a negative effect on our profitability.\nWe conduct exploratory drilling in order to identify additional opportunities for future development. Under the \u201csuccessful efforts\u201d method of accounting that we use, the cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells must be charged to expense in the period in which the wells are determined to be unsuccessful. In addition, lease costs for acreage condemned by the unsuccessful well must also be expensed. In contrast, unsuccessful development wells are capitalized as a part of the investment in the field where they are located. Because exploratory wells generally are more likely to be unsuccessful than development wells, we anticipate that some or all of our exploratory wells may not be productive. The costs of such unsuccessful exploratory wells could result in a significant reduction in our profitability in periods when the costs are required to be expensed.\nIncreasing finding and development costs may impair our profitability.\nIn order to continue to grow and maintain our profitability, we must add new reserves that exceed our production over time at a finding and development cost that yields an acceptable operating margin and DD&A rate. Without cost effective exploration, development or acquisition activities, our production, reserves and profitability will decline over time. Given the relative maturity of most crude oil and natural gas basins in North America and the level of activity in the industry, the cost of finding new reserves through exploration and development operations is high in some basins. The acquisition market for properties has become extremely competitive among producers for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities in North America. Acquisition values for crude oil properties have climbed in recent years and may increase in the future. This increase in finding and development costs results in higher DD&A rates. If the upward trend in crude oil finding and development costs continues, we will be exposed to an increased likelihood of a write-down in the carrying value of our crude oil properties in response to decreases in commodity prices and/or reduction in the profitability of our operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and the cost of servicing, and risks related to refinancing, that debt could adversely affect our business. Those risks could increase if we incur more debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As a result, a significant portion of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowing capacity available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nServicing our indebtedness and satisfying our other obligations will require a significant amount of cash. Our cash flows from operating activities and other sources may not be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial condition and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, including depressed commodity pricing, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA substantial decrease in our operating cash flows or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations, including by curtailing our exploration and drilling programs, selling\nassets, refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements may, and our existing debt agreements do, restrict us from implementing some of these alternatives. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and other available capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate these dispositions for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service or other obligations then due. Because the cash required to service our indebtedness is not available to finance our operations and other business activities, our indebtedness limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and increases our vulnerability to economic downturns and sustained declines in commodity prices.\nCovenants in our debt agreements currently impose, and future financing agreements may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions.\nThe indenture governing our senior notes and our revolving credit facility contain restrictions, and future financing agreements may contain additional restrictions, on our activities, including covenants that restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments;\n\u2022\napply net proceeds from certain asset sales;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\nrestrict dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell equity interests of restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nsell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or dispose of assets.\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by all of our crude oil and natural gas properties as well as a pledge of all ownership interests in our operating subsidiaries. The restrictions contained in our debt agreements may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur revolving credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and our ability to comply with those restrictions and covenants is uncertain. Our lenders can unilaterally reduce our borrowing availability based on anticipated commodity prices.\nWe depend in large part on our revolving credit facility for future capital needs. The terms of the credit agreement require us to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the revolving credit facility or other debt agreements could result in a default under those agreements, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nThe revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from the properties securing their loan. The significant recent decrease in the price of crude oil is likely to have an adverse effect on the borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately, or we must pledge other crude oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the revolving credit facility. Our inability to borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, there would be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and would impact our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our revolving credit facility that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows and are otherwise unable to obtain the funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our revolving credit\nfacility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our revolving credit facility to avoid being in default and we may not be able to obtain such a waiver. If this occurs, we would be in default under our revolving credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to our debt agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase although the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness and for other purposes would decrease.\nNotwithstanding our current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur substantial additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe may be able to incur additional debt in the future. Although our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. In particular, we may borrow under the revolving credit facility, and expect to do so in 2015. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions that may increase our indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levels could intensify the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can adversely affect our operations.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife affect operations in some areas. In certain areas drilling and other activities may be restricted or prohibited by lease stipulations, or prevented by weather conditions, for significant periods of time. This limits our operations in those areas and can intensify competition during the active months for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to additional or increased costs or periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting high costs or shortages could delay our operations and materially increase operating and capital costs and therefore adversely affect our profitability. Similarly, hot weather during some recent periods adversely impacted the operation of certain midstream facilities, and therefore our production. Similar events could occur in the future and could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties in which we own an interest but we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues.\nWe operate approximately 89% of the wells in which we own an interest. If we do not operate the properties in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of the underlying properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s timing and amount of capital expenditures, expertise (including safety and environmental compliance) and financial resources, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, and use of technology. The failure by an operator to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements, could reduce production and revenues and adversely affect our profitability. These risks have been increasing for us in recent years as our capital expenditures for non-operated projects have risen significantly. Our lack of control over non-operated properties also makes it more difficult for us to forecast capital expenditures, production and related matters.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduced income from failure to perform by our counterparties or could limit our potential gains from increases in prices.\nWe use derivatives for a portion of the production from our own wells and for natural gas purchases and sales by our marketing subsidiary to achieve more predictable cash flows, to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, and to allow our natural gas marketing company to offer pricing options to natural gas sellers and purchasers. These arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when purchases or sales are different than expected or the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations. Based on current commodity prices and our current hedging position, we may receive significant revenues from our hedging positions in 2015, increasing the adverse consequences to us if a derivative counterparty fails to perform. In addition, many of our derivative contracts are based on WTI or another oil or natural gas index price. The risk that the differential between the index price and the price we receive for the relevant production may change unexpectedly makes it more difficult to hedge effectively and increases the risk of a hedging-related loss.\nAlso, derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for the relevant commodity, and they may require the use of our resources to meet cash margin requirements. Since we do not designate our derivatives as hedges, we do not currently qualify for use of hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in our income statements, and our net income is subject to greater volatility than it would be if our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting. For instance, if commodity prices rise significantly, this could result in significant non-cash charges during the relevant period, which could have a material negative effect on our net income.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers or other counterparties to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales or joint interest billings to a small number of third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may affect our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, our derivatives as well as the derivatives used by our marketing subsidiary expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Nonperformance by our customers or derivative counterparties may adversely affect our financial condition and profitability. We face similar risks with respect to our other counterparties, including the lenders under our revolving credit facility and the providers of our insurance coverage.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some liabilities or losses that we may incur.\nThe occurrence of a significant accident or other event not fully covered by insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds. We also do not carry contingent business interruption insurance related to the purchasers of our production. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement those or other new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we were unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nOur industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, larger companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low commodity prices. Larger competitors may also be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These factors could adversely affect the success of our operations and our profitability.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nAcquisitions of properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\nAcquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped properties have been an important part of our historical and recent growth. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, development potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, title issues and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform engineering, environmental, geological and geophysical reviews of the acquired properties, which we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, such reviews are not likely to permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well prior to an acquisition and our ability to evaluate undeveloped acreage is inherently imprecise. Even when we inspect a well, we may not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. In some cases, our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited. In addition, we often acquire acreage without any warranty of title except as to claims made by, through or under the transferor.\nWhen we acquire properties, we will generally have potential exposure to liabilities and costs for environmental and other problems existing on the acquired properties, and these liabilities may exceed our estimates. Often we are not entitled to contractual indemnification associated with acquired properties. We often acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with no or limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. Therefore, we could incur significant unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, or losses due to\ntitle defects, in connection with acquisitions for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. In addition, the acquisition of undeveloped acreage is subject to many inherent risks and we may not be able to realize efficiently, or at all, the assumed or expected economic benefits of acreage that we acquire.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or may be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. These factors can increase the risks associated with an acquisition. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price, and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas and exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe administration of U.S. President Barack Obama has proposed to eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The proposals include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address these proposals would impact our business, but any such future laws and regulations could result in higher federal income taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, proposals are made from time to time in states where we operate to implement or increase severance or other taxes at the state level, and any such additional taxes would have similarly adverse effects on us.\nDerivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge crude oil and natural gas prices and increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.\nIn July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivative transactions, including our commodity hedging swaps, and could have a number of adverse effects on us, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions, thus exposing us to additional risks related to commodity price volatility; commodity price decreases would then have an increased adverse effect on our profitability and revenues. Reduced hedging may also impair our ability to have certainty with respect to a portion of our cash flows, which could lead to decreases in capital spending and, therefore, decreases in future production and reserves.\n\u2022\nIf, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or its implementing regulations, we are required to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions, this would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy.\n\u2022\nOur derivatives counterparties will be subject to significant new capital, margin and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect that these requirements will increase the cost to hedge because there will be fewer counterparties in the market and increased counterparty costs will be passed on to us.\nThe above factors could also affect the pricing of derivatives and make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce while physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn December 2009, EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings provide the basis for EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. In June 2010, EPA published its final rule to address the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the CAA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permitting programs. This rule \u201ctailors\u201d these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting. It was widely expected that facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions would be required to also reduce those emissions according to \u201cbest available control technology\u201d (\u201cBACT\u201d) standards. In its permitting guidance for greenhouse gases, issued in November 2010, EPA recommended options for BACT from the largest sources, which include improved energy efficiency, among others. EPA also issued a final rule in July 2013 retaining the \u201ctailored\u201d permitting thresholds, opting not to extend greenhouse gas permitting requirements to smaller stationary sources at that time.\nIn June 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion and order in Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. Environmental Protection Agency, upholding EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas-related rules, including the \u201ctailoring rule,\u201d against challenges from various state and industry group petitioners. In October 2013, the United States Supreme Court in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, accepted a petition for certiorari to decide whether EPA correctly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gases from mobile sources triggered permitting requirements under the CAA for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases. In June 2014, the Supreme Court upholded a portion of EPA\u2019s GHG stationary source program, but invalidated a portion of it. The Court held that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG BACT requirements, but ruled that sources\nsubject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with GHG BACT requirements. Upon remand, EPA is considering how to implement the Court\u2019s decision. Depending on what EPA does, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of greenhouse gases could extend to smaller stationary sources and require us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and also adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn the past, Congress has considered various pieces of legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Congress has not adopted any significant legislation in this respect to date, but could do so in the future. For example, if Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such measures could include a carbon tax, which could result in additional direct costs to our operations. In the absence of such national legislation, many states and regions have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. For example, in February 2014, Colorado adopted rules directly regulating methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.\nPresident Obama has indicated that climate change and greenhouse gas regulation is a significant priority for his second term. The President issued a Climate Action Plan in June 2013 that, among other things, calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. In November 2013, the President released an Executive Order charging various federal agencies, including EPA, with devising and pursuing strategies to improve the country\u2019s preparedness and resilience to climate change. In part through these executive actions, the direct regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector continues to be a focus of regulation. Most notably, in March 2014, EPA published a series of Methane White Papers addressing suspected methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The agency announced in early 2015 that it will be proposing new rules aimed at further reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in 2015, with final rules expected in 2016. These rules will build on the Methane White Papers and will likely include new regulatory requirements affecting our operations. In addition to the proposed Colorado rules discussed above and in \u201cBusiness and Properties-Governmental Regulation-Environmental Matters,\u201d a lawsuit has been filed by several northeastern states that would require EPA to more stringently regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The passage of legislation, or executive and other initiatives that limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations, could require us to incur costs to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, and it could also adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nSome have suggested that one consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods. Flooding that occurred in Colorado in 2013 is an example of an extreme weather event that negatively impacted our operations. If such events were to continue to occur, or become more frequent, our operations could be adversely affected in various ways, including through damage to our facilities from increased costs for insurance.\nAnother possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for natural gas is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market for the fuels that we produce. Despite the use of the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d as a shorthand for climate change, some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. As a result, it is difficult to predict how the market for our fuels could be affected by increased temperature volatility, although if there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe cost of defending any suits brought against us, and any judgments or settlements resulting from such suits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. For example, in recent years, we have been subject to lawsuits regarding royalty practices and payments and matters relating to certain of our affiliated partnerships. The outcome of pending legal proceedings is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, the resolution of such a proceeding could result in penalties or sanctions, settlement costs and/or judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties, sanctions or costs may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or the anticipated range of potential losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws, stockholders rights plan and Nevada law contain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. We have adopted a stockholders rights plan that will dilute the stock ownership of certain acquirers of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, including:\n\u2022\nthe organization of our board of directors as a classified board, which allows no more than one-third of our directors to be elected each year;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022\ncertain Nevada anti-takeover statutes.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings and other cash resources, if any, for the operation and development of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion. In addition, our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future dividends may also be restricted by any debt agreements which we may enter into from time to time.\nA failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our growth.\nBecause our crude oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets, our future reserves, production volumes and cash flows depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. Acquiring additional crude oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise is a significant component of our strategy. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expiration to hold the acreage by production. In highly competitive markets for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in a substantial lease renewal cost or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of our drilling locations are identified, our leases for such acreage will expire. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As such, our actual drilling activities may differ materially from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business. These risks are greater at times and in areas where the pace of our exploration and development activity slows, such as currently in the Utica Shale, where we have suspended drilling activity due to lower commodity prices. In addition, we do not operate a substantial portion of our Utica Shale acreage. Our relative lack of control over this non-operated acreage increases the risk that some of our leases will expire.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. Leases in the Utica area are particularly vulnerable to title deficiencies due the long history of land ownership in the area and correspondingly extensive and complex chains of title. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.", "PERMNO": 62341, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PDCE"}
