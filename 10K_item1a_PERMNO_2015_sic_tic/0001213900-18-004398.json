{"cik": "854800", "company": "MICRONET ENERTEC TECHNOLOGIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and warrants may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nPotential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect our operations.\nOne of our principal offices and operating facilities is located in Israel. Accordingly, with respect to our Israeli facility, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including the Israel-Gaza conflict. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where we can sell our products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nFurthermore, certain of our officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli male citizens who have served in the army are subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service.\nIf we are unable to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers in the future.\nVirtually all of the products that we produce and sell are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The markets and industry in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The products, systems and solutions needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends on our ability to develop and manufacture competitive products and solutions, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. In addition, because of the highly specialized nature of our business, we must be able to hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. If we are unable to develop new products that meet customers\u2019 changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the services of our executive officers, whose potential conflicts of interest may not permit us to effectively execute our business strategy.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our executive officers, particularly David Lucatz, our Chairman and also Micronet\u2019s Chairman and President. Mr. Lucatz also serves as the President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of D.L. Capital Ltd., or DLC, the primary asset of which is its ownership of shares of our common stock. We have a management and consulting services agreement with DLC. Pursuant to a separate management and consulting services agreement, Mr. Lucatz has agreed to devote 22% of his time to Micronet matters for the term of that agreement. Our business and results of operations may suffer if Mr. Lucatz, other executive officers or directors, are unable to devote the attention necessary to our overall business strategy and operations.\nDeveloping new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may cause us to incur significant costs and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of our business relates to developing sophisticated products and applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. While we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not practicable to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. In addition, we may seek limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of our products and systems. We may elect to provide products or services even in instances where we are unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our products and products under development, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to effectively protect our proprietary technology, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent on our proprietary technology. The steps each of our operations, Enertec and Micronet, has taken to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate and we may not be able to prevent others from using our proprietary technology. The methodologies and proprietary technology that constitute the basis of each of Enertec\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s solutions and products are not protected by patents. Existing trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure agreements to which each of Enertec and Micronet is a party offer only limited protection. Therefore, others, including Enertec\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s competitors, may develop and market similar solutions and products, copy or reverse engineer elements of Enertec\u2019s systems or Micronet\u2019s production lines, or engage in the unauthorized use of Enertec\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s intellectual property. Any misappropriation of Enertec\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s proprietary technology or the development of competitive technology may have a significant adverse effect on Enertec\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s ability to compete and may harm our business and financial position.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of Enertec\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s intellectual property rights or bring claims regarding Enertec\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s infringement of a third party\u2019s property rights. This may result in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive judicial or administrative proceedings, which could deprive us of valuable rights, cause us to incur substantial expenses and cause a diversion for technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, we may be required to pay substantial financial damages or be required to discontinue or significantly delay the development, marketing, sale or licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights.\nOur earnings and margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform under our contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. These projections assess:\n\u25cf the productivity and availability of labor;\n\u25cf the complexity of the work to be performed;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of materials;\n\u25cf the impact of delayed performance; and\n\u25cf The timing of product deliveries.\nIf there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we face unexpected contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected and could affect, among other things, our earnings and margins, due to the fact that our contracts are often made on a fixed-price basis.\nOur earnings and margins could be negatively affected by deficient subcontractor performance or unavailable raw materials or components.\nWe rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for our products. Subcontractors perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Occasionally, we rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and vendors could result in a customer terminating a contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.\nWe depend on major customers for a significant portion of our revenues and our future revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by the loss or reduction of the demand for our products or services by such customers.\nA significant portion of our annual revenues in the past two years were derived from a few leading customers that are large scale strategic Israeli defense groups. In the MRM industry a significant portion of our MRM annual revenues derived from a few leading customers. As of December 31, 2017, the MRM division had five customers that combined account for approximately 75% of its revenues.\nIsraeli defense spending historically has been driven by perceived threats to the country\u2019s national security. Although Israel has been under a sustained elevated threat level in recent years, we cannot provide any assurance that its defense budget will continue to grow at the pace it has over the past decade. A decrease in Israel\u2019s defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated. Reductions in our existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings. In the MRM market, most of our major customers do not have any obligation to purchase additional products or services from us. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that any of our leading customers will continue to purchase solutions, products or services at levels comparable to previous years. A substantial loss or reduction in Micronet\u2019s existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented market and may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the future.\nA number of larger competitors have recently entered the MRM market in which Micronet operates. These large companies have far greater development and capital resources than Micronet. Further, there are competitors of Micronet that offer solutions, products and services similar to those offered by Micronet. If they continue, these trends could undermine Micronet\u2019s competitive strength and position and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nMicronet may cease to be eligible for, or receive reduced, tax benefits under Israeli law, which could negatively impact our profits in the future.\nMicronet and Enertec currently receive certain tax benefits under the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments of 1959, as a result of the designation of its production facility as an \u201cApproved Enterprise.\u201d To maintain their eligibility for these tax benefits, Micronet and Enertec must continue to meet several conditions including, among others, generating more than 25% of its gross revenues outside the State of Israel and continuing to qualify as an \u201cIndustrial Company\u201d under Israeli tax law. An Industrial Company, according to the applicable Israeli law (Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969), is a company that resides in Israel (either incorporated in Israel or managed and controlled from Israel) that, during the relevant tax year, derives at least 90% of its income from an Industrial Factory. An Industrial Factory means a factory that is owned by an Industrial Company and where its manufacturing operations constitute a vast majority of the factory\u2019s total operations/business. The tax benefits of qualifying as an Industrial Company include a reduction of the corporate tax from 24% for \u201cRegular Entities\u201d and 16% or 7.5% for \u201cPreferred Enterprises\u201d (depending on the location of industry) in 2017. In addition, in recent years the Israeli government has reduced the benefits available under this program and has indicated that it may further reduce or eliminate benefits in the future. There is no assurance that Micronet and Enertec will continue to qualify for these tax benefits or that such tax benefits will continue to be available at their current level, or at all. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase the amount of tax payable by Micronet and Enertec and, accordingly, reduce our net profit after tax and negatively impact our profits.\nWe have entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Coolisys for the sale of Enertec and our aerospace and defense division. We may not be successful in closing the sale of Enertec.\nOn December 31, 2017, we, Enertec and our wholly owned subsidiary, Enertec Management Ltd., entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Coolisys, a subsidiary of DPW, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the entire share capital of Enertec to Coolisys. The closing of the Share Purchase Agreement is subject to various closing conditions. To date, we have not consummated the sale of Enertec to Coolisys. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully consummate the contemplated sale of Enertec in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf we successfully consummate the sale of Enertec to Coolisys, our future revenues will be dependent on successfully entering into arrangements to be paid management fees from Micronet, or any other subsidiary we may acquire, in the future.\nCurrently, we derive most of our annual revenue through our ownership of our wholly owned subsidiary, Enertec. In addition, we also hold a majority ownership stake in Micronet, although Micronet does not pay us any dividends or management fees. If we are successful in consummating the sale of Enertec to Coolisys, we will have no revenues and therefore, in order to generate revenues, we will need to enter into an arrangement with Micronet, or any other subsidiary we may acquire, relating to the payment for certain management functions we perform. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate, and enter, into such a management arrangement and our failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our future revenues and overall financial condition.\nBecause almost all of our officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against our management for misconduct.\nCurrently, a majority of our directors and officers are or will be nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. Additionally, it may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to hear the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law.\nOur financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur revenues are mainly denominated in U.S. currency and our costs are mainly denominated in Israeli currency. Where possible, we match sales and purchases in these and other currencies to achieve a natural hedge. Currently, neither Enertec nor Micronet has a policy with respect to the use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, except that both Enertec and Micronet will consider engaging in such hedging activities on a case by case basis. To the extent we are unable to fully match our sales and purchases in different currencies, our business will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nIf our beneficial ownership of Micronet\u2019s ordinary shares declines, we may not be able to treat Micronet as our subsidiary, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently hold 50.07% of Micronet\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares through our subsidiary Enertec Electronics. If we are unable to consider Micronet as a consolidated subsidiary, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected and may cause interest in or the market price of our securities to decline.\nWe may become a target for cybersecurity disruptions which may impact our business operations.\nWe may be subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors. If systems for protecting against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient, the Company, customers, employees or third parties could be adversely affected. Such cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost or stolen; result in employee, customer or third party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt business operations. We could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such a cybersecurity disruption, as well as in connection with resulting regulatory actions and litigation, and such disruption may harm our relationships with our customers and impact our business reputation.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Securities\nYour ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because ownership of our common stock is concentrated.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Mr. Lucatz, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President beneficially owns 2,597,200 shares, or approximately 28.4% (and 25.6% on a fully diluted basis) of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Lucatz, may effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, and this may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities, thereby depressing the market price of our securities. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. We have not opted out of the restrictions under Section 203.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any additional financing using our equity securities and/or debt securities.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, such as through our Standby Equity Distribution Agreement as described below, or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Sales of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below certain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities we have previously sold. If additional funds are raised through a credit facility, or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders under the credit facility or holders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations.\nIf the price of our common stock is volatile, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf announcements of developments related to our business;\n\u25cf quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations;\n\u25cf the completion of the proposed sale of Enertec;\n\u25cf new products or product enhancements introduced by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf developments in patents and other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u25cf developments in our relationships with our third party manufacturers and/or strategic partners;\n\u25cf developments in our relationships with our customers and/or suppliers;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States, Israel and other countries;\n\u25cf general conditions in the global economy; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFor these reasons and others, you should consider an investment in our common stock as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the value of your investment.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on Nasdaq and, despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may have been relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly-issued securities may be readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell those shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. Moreover, we may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not currently have any significant research coverage by securities and industry analysts and we may never obtain such research coverage. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or maintain coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock might be negatively affected. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us or will cover us downgrades our securities, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and trading volume to decline.\nWe did not declare or pay cash dividends in either 2017 or 2016 and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have no dividends policy and will consider distributing dividends on a year by year basis. The payment of dividends, if any, in the future, rests within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, our capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. There are no restrictions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. There are no assurances that we will pay dividends in the future.\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq requirements, Nasdaq may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. If we are unable to meet any of the Nasdaq listing requirements in the future, including, for example, if the closing bid price for our common stock falls below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, Nasdaq could determine to delist our common stock, which could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease. In that regard, on September 1, 2017, we received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the closing bid price for our common stocks was below $1.00 per share for the preceding 30 consecutive business days. On January 8, 2018, we received a written notice from Nasdaq that for at least 10 consecutive business days, from December 20, 2017 to January 5, 2018, the closing bid price for our common stock had been at $1.00 or greater and, as a result, we had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). If our closing bid price again falls below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we may be subject to delisting and such delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers and employees.", "PERMNO": 13879, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "MICT"}
