RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes in Part II - Item 8, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our business, operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or businesses in general, such as competitive conditions, may also impair\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nour business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur molecular diagnostics business has limited revenue, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn 2014, we acquired RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc., or RedPath, and certain assets from Asuragen, Inc., or Asuragen. As a result, we now offer PancraGen\u00ae, ThyGenX, and ThyraMIR\u00ae and to a limited extent, PathFinder TG- Barrett's esophagus. The revenue generated from our molecular diagnostics business was $9.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, our molecular diagnostics business had an operating loss of approximately $40.4 million. Although we expect the revenue generated from our molecular diagnostics business to grow significantly in the future there can be no assurance that we will achieve revenue sufficient to offset expenses. Over the next several years, we expect to continue to devote resources to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, our molecular diagnostic tests and to develop and acquire additional diagnostic solutions. However, our business may never achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to finance our business on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic solutions and technologies and grow our business, and potentially force us to seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe expect capital expenditures and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure and commercial operations. We used a significant portion of the net proceeds received at the closing of the sale in December 2015 of our commercial services business, or the Asset Sale, to pay the balance of the outstanding loan under the Credit Agreement, dated October 31, 2014, by and among us, SWK Funding LLC, or SWK, and the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders, and related fees. As a result, we will need to finance our business through collaborations, equity offerings, debt financings, or licensing arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nThere are no assurances that funding will be available when we need it on terms that we find favorable, if at all. Our ability to raise additional financing may be dependent upon our ability to restructure our existing obligations including severance obligations to terminated employees that currently amount to $3.0 million ($1.9 million of which was recorded in continuing operations) at December 31, 2015, as well as $10.7 million of obligations (currently $8.4 million present value) to the equityholders of RedPath. If we are unable to secure additional financing on terms acceptable to us and on a timely basis, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more molecular diagnostic tests or selling and marketing initiatives, we may have to seek stockholder approval to downsize or wind down our operations through liquidation, bankruptcy or a sale of our assets and/or we may not be able to continue as a going concern. Specifically, in order to continue in business and reduce our obligations that we cannot manage or meet, we may be required to seek the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. If we are required to seek Chapter 11 protection and we are unable to successfully negotiate sufficient reduction in obligations to meet our revenues, we may be required to file for Chapter 7 liquidation. Additionally, the equityholders of RedPath carry a lien on virtually all of our assets to secure our obligations. Thus, Chapter 7 proceedings would likely result in limited if any distribution of remaining assets to our common shareholders. These actions would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results currently depend solely on sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these and other molecular diagnostic solutions that we develop or acquire to grow our business.\nAll of our revenue currently is derived from the sale of our molecular diagnostic tests, which we initially launched commercially in the second half of 2014. We have several additional molecular diagnostics test in late stage development, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize those tests. If we are unable to increase sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, expand reimbursement for these tests, or successfully develop and commercialize other molecular diagnostic tests, our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability would be impaired, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe have a limited operating history as a molecular diagnostics company, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe were originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1986 and began commercial operations in 1987. In connection with our initial public offering, we re-incorporated in Delaware in 1998. From 1987 until the Asset Sale, our operations focused primarily on our commercial services business, which was the personal promotion of pharmaceutical customers\u2019 products through outsourced sales teams. We now conduct our molecular diagnostics business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Interpace Diagnostics, LLC, which was formed in Delaware in 2013, and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation which was formed in Delaware in 2007. We began our own commercial sales of our molecular diagnostic tests in late 2014. Consequently, any evaluations about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe depend on a few payors for a significant portion of our revenue, and if one or more significant payors stops providing reimbursement or decreases the amount of reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests, our revenue could decline.\nRevenue for tests performed on patients covered by Medicare was 42.9%, of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The percentage of our revenue derived from significant payors is expected to fluctuate from period to period as our revenue increases, as additional payors provide reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests or if one or more payors were to stop reimbursing for our molecular diagnostic tests or change their reimbursed amounts.\nSince September 2012, Novitas Solutions, Inc., has been the regional Medicare administrative contractor, or MAC, that handles claims processing for Medicare services with jurisdiction for the PancraGen\u2122, ThyGenX, ThyraMIR and PathFinder TG- Barrett's esophagus. On a five-year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional MAC services. Any future changes in the MAC processing or coding for Medicare claims for our molecular diagnostic tests could result in a change in the coverage or reimbursement rates for such molecular diagnostic tests, or the loss of coverage.\nOur PancraGen\u00ae and ThyGenX tests are reimbursed by Medicare based on applicable Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. PancraGen\u00ae is currently reimbursed by Medicare at $3,038 a test and ThyGenX has been reimbursed by Medicare at $1,054 a test. Any future reduction from the current rate would have a material adverse effect on business and results of operations.\nAlthough we have entered into contracts with certain third-party payors which establish in-network allowable rates of reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests, payors may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. Any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue.\nIf payors do not provide reimbursement, rescind or modify their reimbursement policies or delay payments for our tests, or if we are unable to successfully negotiate additional reimbursement contracts, our commercial success could be compromised.\nPhysicians may generally not order our tests unless payors reimburse a substantial portion of the test price. There is uncertainty concerning third-party reimbursement of any test incorporating new molecular diagnostic technology. Reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that tests such as our molecular diagnostic tests are: (a) not experimental or investigational; (b) pre-authorized and appropriate for the patient; (c) cost-effective; (d) supported by peer-reviewed publications; and (e) included in clinical practice guidelines. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to reimburse our tests, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. Although we have contracted rates of reimbursement with certain payors, which establishes in-network allowable rates of reimbursement for our PancraGen\u00ae, ThyGenX\u00ae, ThyraMIR and PathFinder TG- Barrett's esophagus tests, payors may suspend or discontinue reimbursement at any time, may require or increase co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates paid to us. Any such actions could have a negative effect on our revenue.\nWe have contracted rates of reimbursement with many payors for our PancraGen\u00ae , ThyGenX\u00ae and ThyraMIR tests. Without a contracted rate for reimbursement, claims may be denied upon submission, and we may need to appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. We expect to continue to focus resources on increasing adoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot, however, predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will reimburse us for our molecular diagnostic tests, if at all. In addition, the launch of our molecular diagnostic tests in our PancraGen\u00ae, ThyGenX\u00ae, ThyraMIR and PathFinderTG\u00ae Barrett's platforms and any other new products we may acquire or develop in the future may require that we expend substantial time and resources in order to obtain and retain reimbursement. Also, payor consolidation is underway and creates uncertainty as to whether coverage and contracts with existing payors will remain in effect. Finally, commercial payors may tie their allowable rates to Medicare rates, and should Medicare reduce their rates, we may be negatively impacted. If we fail to establish broad adoption of and\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nreimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests, or if we are unable to maintain existing reimbursement from payors, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if physicians decide not to order our molecular diagnostic tests.\nIf we are unable to create or maintain demand for our molecular diagnostic tests in sufficient volume, we may not become profitable. To generate demand, we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education by our internal sales force. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors will be critical to generating revenue.\nIn many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. Accordingly, physicians may be reluctant to order a diagnostic test that may suggest surgery is unnecessary. In addition, our molecular diagnostic tests are performed at our laboratories rather than by a pathologist in a local laboratory, so pathologists may be reluctant to support our molecular diagnostic tests. In addition, guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules may change to recommend another type of treatment protocol, and these changes may result in medical practitioners deciding not to use our molecular diagnostic tests. These facts may make physicians reluctant to convert to using our molecular diagnostic tests, which could limit our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if patients decide not to use our molecular diagnostic tests.\nSome patients may decide not to use our molecular diagnostic tests due to price, all or part of which may be payable directly by the patient if the patient\u2019s insurer denies reimbursement in full or in part. Many insurers seek to shift more of the cost of healthcare to patients in the form of higher co-payments or premiums. In addition, the current economic environment in the United States has and may continue to result in the loss of healthcare coverage. Implementation of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act) also resulted in the loss of health insurance, and increases in premiums and reductions in coverage, for some patients. These events may result in patients delaying or forgoing medical checkups or treatment due to their inability to pay for our test, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue. We do have a Patient Assistance Program that allows eligible patients to apply for assistance in covering a portion of their out of pocket obligation.\nIf our internal sales force is less successful than anticipated, our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability to generate revenues could be diminished. In addition, we have limited history selling our molecular diagnostics tests on a direct basis and our limited history makes forecasting difficult.\nIf our internal sales force is not successful, or new additions to our sales team fail to gain traction among our customers, we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our molecular diagnostic tests. If we fail to establish our molecular diagnostic tests in the marketplace, it could have a negative effect on our ability to sell subsequent molecular diagnostic tests and hinder the desired expansion of our business. We have limited historical experience forecasting the direct sales of our molecular diagnostics products. Our ability to produce product quantities that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to forecast accurately and plan production accordingly.\nDue to how we recognize revenue, our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate.\nWe recognize a significant portion of our revenue when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; services have been rendered; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We have little visibility as to when we will receive payment for our molecular diagnostic tests, and we must appeal negative payment decisions, which delays collections. For molecular diagnostic tests performed where we have an agreed upon reimbursement rate or we are able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement at the time delivery is complete, such as in the case of Medicare and certain other payors, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments to arrive at the amount that we expect to collect. We determine the amount we expect to collect based on a per payor, per contract or agreement basis. In situations where we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of reimbursement, we recognize revenue upon the earlier of receipt of third-party notification of payment or when cash is received. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received from Medicare and other payors where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous estimates and the contractual allowance is adjusted accordingly. These factors will likely result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenue. Should we recognize revenue from payors on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated reimbursement change, or were incorrect at the time we accrued such revenue, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future quarters. As a result, comparing our operating results\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\non a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In addition, these fluctuations in revenue may make it difficult for us, research analysts and investors to accurately forecast our revenue and operating results. If our revenue or operating results fall below expectations, the price of our common stock would likely decline.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for some of the materials used in our molecular diagnostic tests, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers in a timely manner.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for certain materials that we use to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, including Asuragen for our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests pursuant to our supply agreement with them. We also purchase reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests from sole-source suppliers. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in molecular diagnostic test processing could occur. Any such interruption may directly impact our revenue and cause us to incur higher costs.\nWe may experience problems in scaling our operations, or delays or reagent and supply shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue.\nIf we encounter difficulties in scaling our operations as a result of, among other things, quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of reagents and raw material supplies, we will likely experience reduced sales of our molecular diagnostic tests, increased repair or re-engineering costs, and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers, any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins.\nAlthough we attempt to match our capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand, to the extent demand materially varies from our estimates, we may experience constraints in our operations and delivery capacity, which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period. Should our need for raw materials and reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests fluctuate, we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials or reagents.\nIf we are unable to support demand for our molecular diagnostic tests or any of our future tests or solutions, our business could suffer.\nAs demand for our molecular diagnostic tests grows, we will need to continue to scale our testing capacity and processing technology, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot assure you that increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be implemented successfully or that appropriate personnel will be available. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs of processing tests or inability to meet demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability.\nWe compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies or surgery to determine if a patient\u2019s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices. In addition, we face competition from other companies that offer diagnostic tests. Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, has thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic tests that compete with our ThyGenX\u00ae and ThyraMIR\u00ae tests, which are currently on the market, and Veracyte is developing additional tests aimed at fine needle aspirations, or FNAs, for thyroid cancer. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGenX\u00ae test and CBLPath, Inc. is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing. Other competitors include Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Cancer Genetics, Inc., Genomic Health Inc., NeoGenomics Inc. and Trovagene, Inc.\nIt is also possible that we face future competition from laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and/or other diagnostic companies developing new molecular diagnostic tests or technologies. Furthermore, we\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nmay be subject to competition as a result of the new, unforeseen technologies that can be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space.\nTo compete successfully we must be able to demonstrate, among other things, that our molecular diagnostic test results are accurate and cost effective, and we must secure a meaningful level of reimbursement for our tests. Since our molecular diagnostics business began in 2014, many of our potential competitors have stronger brand recognition and greater financial capabilities than we do. Others may develop a test with a lower price than ours that could be viewed by physicians and payors as functionally equivalent to our molecular diagnostic tests, or offer a test at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the price of our molecular diagnostic tests and affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests and overall sales, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As we add new molecular diagnostic tests and services, we will face many of these same competitive risks for these new molecular diagnostic tests and services.\nDeveloping new molecular diagnostic tests involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other molecular diagnostic tests we are developing.\nDeveloping new molecular diagnostic tests and solutions will require us to devote considerable resources to research and development. We may face challenges obtaining sufficient numbers of samples to validate a newly acquired or developed molecular diagnostic test. In order to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic tests, we need to:\n\u2022\nexpend significant funds to conduct substantial research and development;\n\u2022\nconduct successful analytical and clinical studies;\n\u2022\nscale our laboratory processes to accommodate new molecular diagnostic tests; and\n\u2022\nbuild the commercial infrastructure to market and sell new molecular diagnostic tests.\nTypically, few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a molecular diagnostic test or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies, which would adversely affect the timing for generating revenue from such test. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study or if we fail to sufficiently demonstrate analytical validity, we might choose to abandon the development of the molecular diagnostic test, which could harm our business. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize new competing molecular diagnostic tests faster than us or at a lower cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are and may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. In particular, on April 8, 2015, Prolias Technologies, Inc., or Prolias, filed a complaint, or the Complaint, against us with the Superior Court of New Jersey (Morris County) in a matter entitled Prolias Technologies, Inc. v. PDI, Inc. (now known as Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.) (Docket No. MRS-L-899-15), or the Prolias Litigation. In the Complaint, Prolias alleges that we entered into an August 19, 2013 Collaboration Agreement and a First Amendment thereto, or the Prolias Agreement, whereby we agreed to work in good faith to commercialize a diagnostic test known as \u201cThymira.\u201d Thymira is a minimally invasive molecular diagnostic test that is being developed to detect thyroid cancer. Prolias alleges in the Complaint that we wrongfully terminated the Agreement, breached obligations owed to it under the Agreement and committed torts by (i) failing to effectively and timely validate Thymira, (ii) purchasing a competitor of Prolias and working to commercialize the competitive product at the expense of Thymira, and (iii) interfering with a license agreement that Prolias had with Cornell University related to a license for Thymira. Prolias asserts claims against us for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with contract and breach of fiduciary duty and seeks to recover unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest and costs of suit.\nAlthough we deny that we are liable to Prolias for any of the claims asserted in the Complaint and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against those claims and pursue all claims asserted in our counterclaim, the results of the Prolias Litigation and other legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. If we do not prevail in the Prolias Litigation or other legal proceedings, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf we are unable to develop or acquire molecular diagnostic tests to keep pace with rapid technological, medical and scientific change, our operating results and competitive position could be affected.\nRecently, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to diagnostics, particularly diagnostics that are based on genomic information. These advances require us to continuously develop our technology and to work to develop new solutions to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our solutions could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand our product offerings to include new clinical applications. If we are unable to develop or acquire new molecular diagnostic tests or to demonstrate the applicability of our molecular diagnostic tests for other diseases, our sales could decline and our competitive position could be harmed.\nIf the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were to begin to enforce regulation of our molecular diagnostic tests, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and costs associated with complying with post-market requirements.\nClinical laboratory tests like our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA as well as by applicable State laws. Most LDTs are currently not subject to the FDA's, regulation (although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation). In October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. The risk-based classification considers the LDT\u2019s intended use, technological characteristics, and the risk to patients if the LDT were to fail. The FDA has indicated in its guidance that screening devices for malignant cancers are LDTs of higher concern to the FDA and for which enforcement of pre-market and post-market review requirements would likely commence before other LDT types.\nPursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers will be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA's approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. These requirements will be phased in, starting with higher risk LDTs, following the issuance of the FDA\u2019s final guidance on this topic, which the FDA has identified as a priority for 2016. The draft guidance provides that LDTs that are already marketed at the time the final guidance is issued will not be withdrawn from the market during the FDA\u2019s review process. There is no timeframe within which the FDA must issue its final guidance, but issuance of this final guidance has been identified among a list of the FDA's priorities for 2016. How the final guidance will affect our business is not yet known. We cannot provide any assurance that the FDA regulation will not be required in the future for our tests, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that legislation will be enacted into law, regulations could be promulgated or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to continue to offer our molecular diagnostic tests or to develop and introduce new tests. We cannot predict the timing or content of future legislation enacted, regulations promulgated or guidance issued regarding LDTs, or how it will affect our business.\nIf pre-market review is required by the FDA or if we decide to voluntarily pursue the FDA's pre-market review of our tests, there can be no assurance that our molecular diagnostic tests or any tests we may develop or acquire in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. If pre-market review is required, our business could be negatively impacted as a result of commercial delay that may be caused by the new requirements. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support pre-market applications may be significant. If we are required to submit applications for our currently-marketed tests, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which may be time-consuming and costly and could result in our currently-marketed tests being withdrawn from the market. If our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty in the marketplace about our tests, if we are required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are limited, orders may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. Continued compliance with the FDA's regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We cannot predict the timing or form of any such guidance or regulation, or the potential effect on our existing molecular diagnostic tests or our tests in development, or the potential impact of such guidance or regulation on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nIf we fail to comply with Federal, State and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a Federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management and quality assurance. CLIA certification is also required in order for us to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payors, for our molecular diagnostic tests. To renew these certifications, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. We are also required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our New Haven, Connecticut and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania laboratories. Connecticut and Pennsylvania laws require that we maintain a license and establishes standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory in New Haven, Connecticut and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island. California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under the laws of each respective State regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California, Florida, Maryland, New York or Rhode Island. We are currently in late-stage technical review of our ThyGenX\u00ae test for licensing in New York and maintain conditional approval for ThyraMIR\u00ae in New York. If we were unable to obtain or lose our CLIA certificate or State licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to lose our licenses issued by New York or by other States where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those States. New molecular diagnostic tests we may develop may be subject to new approvals by governmental bodies such as New York State, and we may not be able to offer our new molecular diagnostic tests to patients in such jurisdictions until such approvals are received.\nRecent legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nPPACA makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer must pay a sales tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices that are listed with the FDA. The FDA\u2019s final guidance on LDTs may require our molecular diagnostic tests to be regulated as medical devices. However, consistent with the FDA\u2019s policy of exercising enforcement discretion for LDTs, our molecular diagnostic tests are not currently listed as medical devices with the FDA. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was adopted, which included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The moratorium will end on December 31, 2017, and we cannot assure that the tax will not be extended to services such as ours in the future if our tests were to be regulated as devices.\nOther significant measures contained in PPACA include, for example, coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. PPACA also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. In addition, PPACA establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative effect on payment rates for services. The IPAB proposals may affect payments for clinical laboratory services beginning in 2016 and for hospital services beginning in 2020. We are monitoring the effect of PPACA to determine the trends and any potential changes that may be necessitated by the legislation, any of which may potentially affect our business.\nIn addition to PPACA, the effect of which cannot presently be fully quantified, various healthcare reform proposals have emerged from Federal and State governments. For example, in February 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which reduced the clinical laboratory payment rates on the Medicare CLFS by 2% in 2013. In addition, a further reduction of 2% was implemented under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which is to be in effect for dates of service on or after April 1, 2013 until fiscal year 2024. Reductions resulting from the Congressional sequester are applied to total claim payments made; however, they do not currently result in a rebasing of the negotiated or established Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nState legislation on reimbursement applies to Medicaid reimbursement and Managed Medicaid reimbursement rates within that State. Some States have passed or proposed legislation that would revise reimbursement methodology for clinical laboratory payment rates under those Medicaid programs. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the Federal or State level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business, or the effect any future legislation\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nor regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by Federal legislation, cost reduction measures and the expansion in the role of the U.S. government in the healthcare industry may result in decreased revenue, lower reimbursement by payors for our tests or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOngoing calls for deficit reduction at the Federal government level and reforms to programs such as the Medicare program to pay for such reductions may affect the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. In particular, recommendations by the Simpson-Bowles Commission called for the combination of Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (physician and ancillary service insurance) into a single co-insurance and co-payment structure. Currently, clinical laboratory services are excluded from the Medicare Part B co-insurance and co-payment as preventative services. Combining Parts A and B may require clinical laboratories to collect co-payments from patients which may increase our costs and reduce the amount ultimately collected.\nIn 2013, CMS announced plans to bundle payments for clinical laboratory tests together with other services performed during hospital outpatient visits under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. CMS exempted molecular diagnostic tests from this packaging provision at that time. It is possible that this exemption could be removed by CMS in future rule making, which might result in lower reimbursement for tests performed in this setting.\nIn April 2014, the President signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. PAMA removed CMS\u2019s authority to adjust the CLFS based and established a new method for setting CLFS rates. Implementation of this new method for setting CLFS rates begins in 2016. Under PAMA, laboratories that have more than $50,000 in Medicare revenues from laboratory services and that receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from laboratory services would report private payor data from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, to CMS by March 31, 2016. CMS will post the new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payor rates) in November 2016 and the new rates will be effective beginning on January 1, 2017. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2020 through 2022. CMS has issued draft regulations regarding these changes. Further rule-making from CMS will define the time period and data elements evaluated on an annual basis to set reimbursement rates for tests like ours.\nComplying with numerous statutes and regulations pertaining to our molecular diagnostics business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to regulation by both the Federal government and the States in which we conduct our molecular diagnostics business, including:\n\u2022\nThe Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as supplemented by various other statutes;\n\u2022\nThe Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, the amendments thereto, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and contained in 21 C.F.R. Parts 203 and 205, or the PDMA;\n\u2022\nCLIA and State licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nManufacturing and promotion laws;\n\u2022\nMedicare billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u2022\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a Federal healthcare program;\n\u2022\nThe Federal Stark physician self-referral law (and state equivalents), which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition;\n\u2022\nThe Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which established comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments made in 2013 to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general, and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u2022\nThe Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n\u2022\nThe Federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022\nOther Federal and State fraud and abuse laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, prohibitions on the provision of products at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022\nThe prohibition on reassignment of Medicare claims, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the reassignment of Medicare claims to any other party;\n\u2022\nThe rules regarding billing for diagnostic tests reimbursable by the Medicare program, which prohibit a physician or other supplier from marking up the price of the technical component or professional component of a diagnostic test ordered by the physician or other supplier and supervised or performed by a physician who does not \u201cshare a practice\u201d with the billing physician or supplier; and\n\u2022\nState laws that prohibit other specified practices related to billing such as billing physicians for testing that they order, waiving coinsurance, co-payments, deductibles, and other amounts owed by patients, and billing a State Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to other payors.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations. We periodically conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to governmental review. The growth of our business may increase the potential of violating these laws, regulations or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Violations of Federal or State regulations may incur investigation or enforcement action by the FDA, Department of Justice, State agencies, or other legal authorities, and may result in substantial civil, criminal, or other sanctions. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, we could face possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal or State healthcare programs and we could even be required to cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to comply with Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties.\nWe retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of our business. These arrangements, like any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider, may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. All arrangements are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark Laws, respectively. However, there are no guarantees that the Federal or State governments will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability under Federal and State laws. Under existing laws, all arrangements must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law, and there is no guarantee that the government will agree with our payment practices with respect to the relationships between our laboratories and the healthcare providers. A failure to comply with Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to our payment practices could result in substantial penalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nWe are subject to Federal, State and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling and disposal of biological material, chemicals and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs and any related penalties or fines, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to us or our third-party service providers could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nOur business requires that we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information about patients, credit card information, and our proprietary business and financial information. We face a number of risks relative to our protection of, and our service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, including loss of access, inappropriate disclosure and inappropriate access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other activities. While we have not experienced any such attack or breach, if such event would occur and cause interruptions in our operations, our networks would be compromised and the information we store on those networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could disrupt our operations, including our ability to process tests, provide test results, bill payors or patients, process claims, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our solution and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf we are sued for product liability or errors and omissions liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our molecular diagnostic tests could lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that the molecular diagnostic test failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to physicians or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. A product liability or errors and omissions liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of such claims. Any product liability or errors and omissions liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our products and solutions. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nFollowing the Asset Sale, we are a small company with 65 full-time employees, excluding transition employees, as of March 28, 2016. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, attract, retain, motivate and integrate highly skilled personnel. We may increase the number of employees in the future depending on the progress of our development of molecular diagnostic tests. Our future financial performance and our ability to sell our existing molecular diagnostic tests and develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic tests and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022\nmanage our clinical studies effectively;\n\u2022\nintegrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and regulatory personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u2022\nhire and train additional qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results. We may need to reduce the size of our organization in order to become profitable and we may experience difficulties in managing these reductions.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nBilling for our diagnostic solutions is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our molecular diagnostic tests.\nBilling for clinical laboratory testing services is complex, time consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payors, including Medicare, insurance companies and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. To the extent laws or contracts require us to bill patient co-payments or co-insurance, we must also comply with these requirements. We may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including write-offs of doubtful accounts and long collection cycles, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Among others, the following factors make the billing process complex:\n\u2022\ndifferences between the list price for our molecular diagnostic tests and the reimbursement rates of payors;\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex Federal and State regulations related to billing Medicare;\n\u2022\ndisputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022\ndifferences in coverage among payors and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u2022\ndifferences in information and billing requirements among payors;\n\u2022\nincorrect or missing billing information; and\n\u2022\nthe resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nAs we introduce new molecular diagnostic tests, we will need to add new codes to our billing process as well as our financial reporting systems. Failure or delays in effecting these changes in external billing and internal systems and processes could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow. Additionally, our billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees, challenge coverage and payment denials, assist patients in appealing claims, and undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. Payors also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further complexity to the billing process. These billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our diagnostic solution, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.\nWe rely on a third-party to process and transmit claims to payors, and any delay in either could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nWe rely on a third-party provider to provide overall processing of claims and to transmit the actual claims to payors based on the specific payor billing format. If claims for our molecular diagnostic tests are not submitted to payors on a timely basis, or if we are required to switch to a different provider to handle claim submissions, we may experience delays in our ability to process these claims and receipt of payments from payors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnacted healthcare reform legislation may increase our costs, impair our ability to adjust our pricing to match any such increased costs, and therefore could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPPACA entails sweeping healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018, although certain of these effective dates have been delayed by action of the current administration. While some guidance has been issued under PPACA over the past several years, many provisions in PPACA require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and State governments. This reform includes, but is not limited to: the implementation of a small business tax credit; required changes in the design of our healthcare policy including providing insurance coverage to part-time workers working on average thirty (30) or more hours per week; \u201cgrandfathering\u201d provisions for existing policies; \u201cpay or play\u201d requirements; a \u201cCadillac plan\u201d excise tax; and specifically required \u201cessential benefits,\u201d that must be included in \u201cqualified plans,\u201d which benefits include coverage for laboratory tests.\nEffective January 1, 2014, each State was required to participate in the PPACA marketplace and make health insurance coverage available for purchase by eligible individuals through a website. While these websites were subject to significant administrative issues leading up to their inception dates (and, in some cases, thereafter), it is currently estimated that in excess of 11 million individuals nationwide had enrolled in health insurance coverage through these exchanges as of the end of 2015. It is unclear, however, how many of these individuals are becoming insured after previously not having health insurance coverage, versus maintaining their plans purchased on the exchanges in 2014 or switching from other health insurance plans.\nPPACA also requires \u201cApplicable Manufacturers\u201d to disclose to the Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services drug sample distributions and certain payments or transfers of value to covered recipients (physicians and teaching hospitals) on an annual basis. \u201cApplicable Manufacturers\u201d and \u201cApplicable Group Purchasing Organizations\u201d must also disclose certain\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nphysician ownership or investment interests. The data submitted will ultimately be made available on a public website. Based upon the structure of our relationship with our clients, we may be included in the definition of \"Applicable Manufacturer\" for purposes of the disclosure requirements or may provide services that include the transfer of drug samples and/or other items of value to covered recipients. As such, we may be required to disclose or provide information that is subject to disclosure. There may be certain risks and penalties associated with the failure to properly make such disclosures, including but not limited to the specific civil liabilities set forth in PPACA, which allows for a maximum civil monetary penalty per \u201cApplicable Manufacturer\u201d of $1,150,000 per year. There may be additional risks and claims made by third parties derived from an improper disclosure that are difficult to ascertain at this time.\nIn June 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of key provisions of PPACA. PPACA contains numerous other initiatives that impact the pharmaceutical industry. These include, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing existing price rebates in Federally funded healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nexpanding rebates, or other pharmaceutical company discounts, into new programs;\n\u2022\nimposing a new non-deductible excise tax on sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products by prescription drug manufacturers and importers;\n\u2022\nincreasing requirements on employer-sponsored health insurance plans, generally, and imposing taxes on certain high-cost employer-sponsored plans;\n\u2022\ncreating an independent commission to propose changes to Medicare with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in Medicare Part D; and\n\u2022\nincreasing oversight by the FDA of pharmaceutical research and development processes and commercialization activities.\nWhile PPACA may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage, its cost containment measures could also adversely affect reimbursement for any of our molecular diagnostic tests. Cost control initiatives also could decrease the price that we receive for any molecular diagnostic tests we may develop in the future. If our molecular diagnostic tests are not considered cost-effective or if we are unable to generate adequate third-party reimbursement for the users of our molecular diagnostic tests, then we may be unable to maintain revenue streams sufficient to realize our targeted return on investment for our molecular diagnostic tests.\nWe are currently unable to determine the long-term, direct or indirect impact of such legislation on our business. Since the effect of many of the provisions of PPACA may not be determinable for a number of years, we do not expect PPACA to have a material adverse impact on our near term results of operations. However, healthcare reform as mandated and implemented under PPACA and any future Federal or State mandated healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations by increasing our operating costs, including our costs of providing health insurance to our employees, decreasing our revenue, impeding our ability to attract and retain customers, requiring changes to our business model, or causing us to lose certain current competitive advantages.\nChanges in governmental regulation could negatively impact our business operations and increase our costs.\nThe pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare industries are subject to a high degree of governmental regulation. Significant changes in these regulations affecting our business could result in the imposition of additional restrictions on our business, additional costs to us in providing our molecular diagnostic tests to our customers or otherwise negatively impact our business operations. Changes in governmental regulations mandating price controls and limitations on patient access to our products could also reduce, eliminate or otherwise negatively impact our sales.\nIf we do not increase our revenues and successfully manage the size of our operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe majority of our operating expenses are personnel-related costs such as employee compensation and benefits, reagents and disposable supplies as well as the cost of infrastructure to support our operations, including facility space and equipment. We continuously review our personnel to determine whether we are fully utilizing their services. For example, on November 19, 2015, we implemented a work force reduction of 18 employees from our molecular diagnostics business. If we believe we are not in a position to fully utilize our personnel, we may make further reductions to our workforce. If we are unable to achieve revenue growth in the future or fail to adjust our cost infrastructure to the appropriate level to support our revenues, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may not have enough cash available to service our debt.\nOn October 31, 2014, we issued an $11.0 million interest-free note to the representative of the equityholders of RedPath, or the Note, at the closing of our acquisition of RedPath. Our ability to make scheduled payments on the Note, as amended, or to refinance our debt, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors beyond our control. If in the future we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we, among other things, may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell material assets. If we are not able to refinance our debt as necessary, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt. Despite being leveraged, we may be able to incur more debt in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks of our leverage. We may need to incur additional debt in the future to complete acquisitions or capital projects or for working capital. In certain circumstances, we may need to incur substantial additional debt. Moreover, if we breach any of our obligations under the Note, as amended, including our payment obligations, we may be in default under the terms of our debt. A significant portion or all of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, the equityholders of RedPath also have a secured lien interest on virtually all of our assets. Accordingly, any failure to comply with the obligations of the Note, as amended, may result in an event of default, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and the equityholders of RedPath.\nIn connection with our acquisition of RedPath and certain assets of Asuragen in 2014, we are obligated to make certain royalty and milestone payments. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we owe a $500,000 milestone payment, which was payable in February 2016, but which we are currently in the process of negotiating a restructuring of the payment, and are obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae pancreas platform for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale. With respect to our acquisition of RedPath, the equityholders of RedPath are entitled to an additional $5 million cash payment upon the achievement by us of $14.0 million or more in annual net sales of PathFinder TG for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and a further $5 million cash payment upon the achievement by us of $37.0 million or more in annual net sales of a basket of assays of Interpace Diagnostics, LLC and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation. In addition, we are obligated to pay revenue based payments through 2025 of 6.5% on annual net sales above $12.0 million of PancraGen\u00ae and 10% on annual net sales up to $30 million of PathFinder TG- Barrett's esophagus for the management of Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\nEven if we are able to successfully launch the above referenced diagnostic tests, our profitability will be impaired by our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to Asuragen and the equityholders of RedPath. Although we believe, under such circumstances, that the increase in revenue will exceed the corresponding royalty and milestone payments, our obligations to Asuragen and the equityholders of RedPath could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to manage our operating costs and expenses at profitable levels.\nThe resignation of our President and Chief Executive Officer, the appointment of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and any potential search for, and appointment of, a permanent Chief Executive Officer could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, the departure of our Chief Financial Officer in March 2016 could result in disruption in our business.\nOn December 21, 2015, our Board of Directors, or our Board, accepted the resignation of Nancy Lurker as our president and chief executive officer. Our Board appointed Jack E. Stover, previously Chairman of our Audit Committee, as interim president and chief executive officer. As a result of this change, we may experience disruption or have difficulty in maintaining or developing our business during this transition. Further, any potential search for, and hiring of, a permanent chief executive officer may also cause disruption or result in difficulty in maintaining or developing our business.\nAs a result of the resignation of Ms. Lurker and the appointment of an interim president and chief executive officer, our senior management team has limited experience working together as a group. This lack of shared experience could negatively impact our senior management team\u2019s ability to quickly and efficiently respond to problems and effectively manage our business. If our management team is not able to work together as a group, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nEffective March 1, 2016, Graham G. Miao no longer serves as the Executive Vice President (\u201cEVP\u201d), Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d), Secretary and Treasurer of Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d). In connection with Mr. Miao\u2019s departure,\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nthe Company entered into an Agreement and General Release (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Mr. Miao. In light of Mr. Miao\u2019s departure, on February 26, 2016, the Company appointed Nat Krishnamurti as Interim CFO, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company effective as of March 1, 2016. Mr. Krishnamurti will also serve as the Company\u2019s principal accounting officer. We may experience a disruption in our business during this transition.\nAs a result of certain terminations of employment and change of control features in employment contracts of certain key employees due to the sale of the CSO business in 2015 and our transition to a standalone molecular diagnostics business, substantial payments are scheduled during 2016 that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow as well as threaten the continuity of our business.\nIn late 2015, in connection with the sale of our CSO business and our transition to a standalone molecular diagnostics business, we implemented work force reductions and made leadership changes. As a result we are currently due to make payments during 2016 to former employees amounting to approximately $3.0 million ($1.9 million of which was recorded in continuing operations) . During the first quarter of 2016, we implemented additional workforce reductions, which will create additional obligations when finalized. If we are unable to make these payments, our business, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets or make investments in other companies or molecular diagnostic technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of synergistic businesses or molecular diagnostic assets. If we make any further acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisition by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Integration of an acquired company or business will also likely require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. To finance any acquisitions or investments, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for these activities through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If these funds are raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Consummating an acquisition poses a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to accurately estimate the financial impact of an acquisition on our overall business;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may require us to incur debt or other obligations, incur large and immediate write-offs, issue capital stock potentially dilutive to our stockholders or spend significant cash, or may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nif we spend significant funds or incur additional debt or other obligations, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline;\n\u2022\nworse than expected performance of an acquired business may result in the impairment of intangible assets;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining key personnel, partners, customers or other key relationships, and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to successfully manage relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nour customers may not accept new molecular diagnostic tests from our acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts of our acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to combine product offerings and product lines of our acquired businesses timely and efficiently;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may involve unexpected costs or liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to acquisitions or exercise by stockholders of their statutory appraisal rights, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from our expectations;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may involve significant contingent payments that may adversely affect our future liquidity or capital resources;\n\u2022\naccounting for contingent payments requires significant judgment and changes to the assumptions used in determining the fair value of our contingent payments could lead to significant volatility in earnings;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and subsequent integration of these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of an unsuccessful acquisition may adversely affect our financial performance.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nAdditional risks of integration of an acquired business include:\n\u2022\ndiffering information technology, internal control, financial reporting and record-keeping systems;\n\u2022\ndifferences in accounting policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated additional transaction and integration-related costs;\n\u2022\nfacilities or operations of acquired businesses in remote locations and the inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments; and\n\u2022\nnew products, including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products may not have been adequately protected or that such products may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nIf our information technology and communications systems fail or we experience a significant interruption in their operation, our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology and communications systems. The failure of these systems to operate as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs. In addition, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our information technology and communications systems, including the information technology systems and services that are maintained by third party vendors, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fire, terrorist attacks, malicious attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power loss or failure of computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data networks. If these systems or services become unavailable or suffer a security breach, we may expend significant resources to address these problems, and our reputation, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have and may continue to experience goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.\nWe are required to evaluate goodwill at least annually, and between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant such a test.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $15.7 million for the remaining balance in the account. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe review the recoverability of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value of the asset to its fair value measured by future discounted cash flows. This analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and, where applicable, judgments associated with, among other factors, the appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary. During the fourth quarter of 2015, due to the decline in market capitalization and other factors, we reviewed the recoverability of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no finite-lived intangible assets were impaired. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may not be able to fund the remaining obligations of our previously sold CSO business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of the CSO sale, not all of our CSO obligations were assumed by the Buyer. These obligations consist of accounts payable, costs relating to the closeout of the ERT business and termination of various vendor contracts that had been associated with CSO. As such, we continue to pay some of these obligations, but may not be able to satisfy all of these remaining obligations. If we are unable to satisfy all our remaining CSO obligations, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE ASSET SALE\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement exposes us to contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have agreed to indemnify the Buyer for damages resulting from or arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of ours in the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2015, by and between us and the Buyer, or the Asset Purchase Agreement, any and all liabilities of ours not assumed by the Buyer in the Asset Sale and for certain other\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nmatters. Significant indemnification claims by the Buyer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We will not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer for any breach of certain of the representations and warranties by us under the Asset Purchase Agreement until the aggregate amount of claims for indemnification exceed $250,000. In the event that claims for indemnification exceed this threshold, we will be obligated to indemnify the Buyer for any damages or loss resulting from such breach up to 25% of the total purchase price paid or due and payable by the Buyer to us. Claims for indemnification for breaches of covenants made by us under the Asset Purchase Agreement and for breaches of representations and warranties classified as fundamental representations or any provision of the Asset Purchase Agreement relating to taxes will not be subject to the deductible or aggregate liability cap described above. The Asset Purchase Agreement also allows the Buyer to withhold monies due against an earn-out payment if indemnification claims are asserted. In addition, under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we will retain all of our debts and liabilities not assumed by the Buyer.\nA portion of the purchase price from the Asset Sale is contingent and we may not receive those payments.\nWe are entitled to receive an earn-out payment equal to one-third of the 2016 revenues generated by our former commercial services business under certain specified contracts and client relationships, less the aggregate cash purchase price at the closing of the Asset Sale of $28,374,182, subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment, and the assumption by the Buyer of certain specified liabilities. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer may offset any claim for indemnification made by it or certain related parties against the earn-out payment then or in the future payable by the Buyer to us. The Buyer has certain discretion in its operation of the business post-closing which may limit our ability to achieve the earn-out payment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we breach the Asuragen License Agreement or the CPRIT License Agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and commercialization efforts for miRInform\u2122 thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nWe currently license certain patents and know-how from Asuragen relating to (i) miRInform\u00ae thyroid and pancreas cancer diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, or the Asuragen License Agreement, and (ii) the sale of diagnostic devices and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer, or the CPRIT License Agreement. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we owe a $500,000 milestone payment, which was payable in February 2016, but which we are currently in the process of negotiating a restructuring of the payment, and are obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae pancreas platform for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, on the future net sales of the miRInform\u00ae thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale. Under the CPRIT License Agreement, we are obligated to pay 5% of net sales on sales of diagnostic devices and the performance of services relating to thyroid cancer, subject to a maximum deduction of 1.5% for royalties paid to third parties. Both of the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement continue until terminated by (i) mutual agreement of the parties or (ii) either party in the event of a material breach of the respective agreement by the other party. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under the CPRIT License Agreement, Asuragen will have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed patent rights relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights and other technology licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under these license agreements could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under these license agreements, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our molecular diagnostic tests currently on the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and commercialization efforts for miRInform\u00ae thyroid and pancreas cancer molecular diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, and the sale of molecular diagnostic tests and the performance of certain services relating to thyroid cancer.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. While we apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in relevant jurisdictions. Others could seek to design around our current or future patented technologies. We may not be successful in defending any challenges made against our patents or patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents and increased competition to our business. The outcome of patent litigation can be\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nuncertain and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nMonitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Further, competitors could willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that arguably fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or replicate any of our products and technologies. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect us against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our overall business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our molecular diagnostic tests.\nAs is the case with other molecular diagnostics companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents of molecular diagnostics tests, like our molecular diagnostic tests in our PancraGen\u00ae and miRInform\u00ae platforms, involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. From time-to-time the U.S. Supreme Court, other Federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, on October 30, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision that methods or processes cannot be patented unless they are tied to a machine or involve a physical transformation. The U.S. Supreme Court later reversed that decision in Bilski v. Kappos, finding that the \u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not the only test for determining patent eligibility. The Court, however, declined to specify how and when processes are patentable. On March 30, 2012, in the case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\u2019s application of Bilski and invalidated a patent focused on a process for identifying a proper dosage for an existing therapeutic because the patent claim embodied a law of nature. On July 30, 2012, the USPTO released a memorandum entitled \u201c2012 Interim Procedure for Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis of Process Claims Involving Laws of Nature,\u201d with guidelines for determining patentability of diagnostic or other processes in line with the Mayo decision. On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, the Supreme Court held that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated. The Supreme Court did not address the patentability of any innovative method claims involving the manipulation of isolated genes. On March 4, 2014, the USPTO released a memorandum entitled \u201c2014 Procedure For Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products.\u201d This memorandum provides guidelines for the USPTO\u2019s new examination procedure for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 for claims embracing natural products or natural principles. On June 12, 2015, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in Ariosa v. Sequenom holding that a method for detecting a paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin performed on a maternal serum or plasma sample from a pregnant female were unpatentable as directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon. On July 30, 2015, the USPTO released a Federal Register Notice entitled, \u201cJuly 2015 Update on Subject Matter Eligibility,\u201d This Notice updated the USPTO guidelines for the USPTO\u2019s procedure for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 for claims embracing natural products or natural principles phenomenon. Although the guidelines do not have the force of law, patent examiners have been instructed to follow them. What constitutes a law of nature and a sufficient inventive concept remains uncertain, and it is possible that certain aspects of molecular diagnostics tests would be considered natural laws and, therefore, ineligible for patent protection. Some aspects of our technology involve processes that may be subject to this evolving standard and we cannot guarantee that any of our pending or issued claims will be patentable or upheld as valid as a result of such evolving standards. In addition, patents we own or license that issued before these recent cases may be subject to challenge in court or before the USPTO in view of these current legal standards. Accordingly, the evolving interpretation and application of patent laws in the United States governing the eligibility of diagnostics for patent protection may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any owned and licensed patents. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations and application of patent laws may also diminish the value of our existing intellectual property or intellectual property that we continue to develop. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforceable in our patents or in third-party patents.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nWe may be involved in litigation related to intellectual property, which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may receive notices of claims of direct or indirect infringement or misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights from time to time and some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assume that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or other rights, or the validity of our patents, trademarks or other rights, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. No assurance can be given that other patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications. If third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could incur significant costs and experience management distraction. Litigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patents and proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us, and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity, scope and coverage of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and ongoing royalties, and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling our products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. We could incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe may not be able to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn January 7, 2016, we received written notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC notifying us that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the written notice, we no longer meet the minimum bid price requirement. The written notice provided an initial 180-day period to regain compliance. We have until July 5, 2016 to regain compliance by maintaining a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event that we do not regain compliance by that date, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC may commence delisting proceedings, which could adversely impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock; limiting our ability to issue additional securities in the future; and limiting our ability to fund our operations.\nOur largest stockholders continue to have significant influence, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nJohn P. Dugan, our former chairman, and Heartland Advisors, Inc. beneficially own approximately 27.6% and 17.7% of our outstanding common stock, respectively. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over the election of all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including a merger with or into another company, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and amendments to our certificate of incorporation. This ownership concentration by these stockholders could delay or prevent a change in corporate control that may otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders.\nWe have anti-takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions, such as providing for three classes of directors, which may make it more difficult to remove our directors and management and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which allows our Board to create one or\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nmore classes of preferred stock with rights and preferences greater than those afforded to the holders of our common stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a future takeover or a change in control, unless the takeover or change in control is approved by our Board. We are also subject to laws that may have a similar effect. For example, section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. As a result of the foregoing, it will be difficult for another company to acquire us and, therefore, could limit the price that possible investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, the rights of our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.\nOur quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may vary as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nuncertainty about when sales of our molecular diagnostic tests will be recognized;\n\u2022\nadoption of and coverage and reimbursement for our molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments; and\n\u2022\ntiming and integration of any acquisitions.\nWe believe that quarterly, and in certain instances annual, comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Fluctuations in quarterly and annual results could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long-term operating performance.\nOur stock price is volatile and could be further affected by events not within our control, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nDuring 2015, our common stock traded at a low of $0.42 and a high of $2.74. During 2014, our stock traded at a low of $1.34 and a high of $6.25. The trading price of our common stock has been and will continue to be subject to:\n\u2022\ngeneral volatility in the trading markets;\n\u2022\nsignificant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in our cash and cash equivalent reserves;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nindustry and/or regulatory developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue mix;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue and revenue growth rates for us and for the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022\nstatements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management's attention.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nThe indemnification rights provided to our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against its directors, officers, and employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions permitting us to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, and employees. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nInterpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 86083, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "IDXG"}
