RISK FACTORS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors identified elsewhere in this Report, the most significant risk factors affecting our business include those set forth below. The below description of risk factors is not exhaustive, and readers should not consider the description of such risk factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us.\nMarket, Interest Rate, Credit and Liquidity Risk\nEconomic and general market conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic, market, political and social conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, political risks and the sustainability of economic growth. Continued economic challenges include under-employment, declines in energy prices, the ongoing low interest rate environment, restrained growth in consumer demand, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus other currencies, and continued risk in the consumer and commercial real estate markets. Deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are also affected by domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy. For example, the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve impacts our cost of funds for investing and lending activities. Central bank actions can also affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"), and their policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the costs of running our business.\nFurther, any deterioration in the mortgage market may also reduce the number of new mortgages that we originate, increase the costs of servicing mortgages without a corresponding increase in servicing fees or adversely affect our ability to sell mortgage loans originated by us. Any such event could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could lead to lower mortgage origination volume, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2015, approximately 60 percent of our revenue was derived from the origination of residential mortgages. The residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to interest rates, and lower interest rates generally increase that business, while higher interest rates generally cause that business to decrease. Therefore, our performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates. Historically, mortgage origination volumes and sales for the Bank and for other financial institutions have widened and narrowed in response to these and other factors. During portions of 2015, the interest rate environment was quite favorable for mortgage loan originations, particularly refinancing activity. There is no guarantee that these conditions will persist, and a change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, increasing long-term interest rates may decrease our mortgage loan originations. Generally, the volume of mortgage loan originations is inversely related to the long-term interest rate curve. During periods of low long-term interest rates, a significant number of our customers may elect accelerated prepayments as they seek to refinance their mortgages (i.e., pay off their existing higher rate mortgage loans with new mortgage loans obtained at lower interest rates). Our profitability levels and those of others in the mortgage industry have generally been strongest during periods of low and/or declining interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our held-for-investment mortgage loan portfolio, our mortgage related assets, our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the average life of our mortgage loans and mortgage related securities. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in prepayments of our mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their own borrowing costs. As prepayment speeds on mortgage related securities increase, any premium\namortization would increase on a prospective basis. Any immediate adjustments required under the application of the interest method of income recognition may also result in lower net interest income. On the other hand, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate mortgage loans. Additionally, there were wider spreads between short- and long-term interest rates during portions of 2015, resulting in higher profit margins on loan sales than in prior periods.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including on our net interest margin and the value of our investment assets.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. While we have modeled rising interest rate scenarios using historic data and such scenarios result in an increase in our net interest income, our interest-bearing liabilities may reprice or mature more quickly than modeled, thus resulting in a decrease in our net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our variable rate loans held-for-sale, loans held-for-investment and investment securities. Generally, the value of our investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Decreases in the fair value of our investment securities, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity or our earnings if the decrease in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary.\nAt December 31, 2015 we had $296 million of MSRs which we manage using certain derivative strategies which may be ineffective.\nWe invest in MSRs to support mortgage strategies and to deploy capital at acceptable returns. Our MSRs are sensitive to interest rate volatility and are highly susceptible to prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among other factors. In addition, when interest rates fluctuate, repricing risks arise from the timing difference in the maturity and/or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions. While such repricing mismatches are fundamental to our business, they can expose us to fluctuations in income and economic value, in particular as interest rates vary. We utilize derivatives and other fair value assets as part of our overall hedging strategy to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the MSRs, but these risk management strategies do not completely eliminate repricing risk. Although we use models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage related revenues, the estimates of revenues produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand, prepayment speeds and other factors which may differ from actual subsequent experience. In addition, our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors, many of which are outside of our control. If one or more of these assumptions and projections proves to be incorrect or our hedging strategies may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, and as a result we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings.\nAt December 31, 2015, our MSR was $296 million or 20.6 percent of Tier 1 Capital. We may be unable to effectively manage our MSR concentration risk which could impact capital under Basel III, which when fully phased-in will require any MSR balance exceeding 10 percent of our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital deduction threshold.\nAs of January 1, 2015, we are subject to new rules relating to capital standards requirements, including requirements contemplated by Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III established a new qualifying criteria for regulatory capital, including new limitations on the inclusion of deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights. Basel III limits the inclusion of MSRs and deferred tax assets to 10 percent of Common Equity Tier 1 (as defined in the Basel III final framework, \"CET1\"), individually, and 15 percent of CET1, in the aggregate. We have established a plan to reduce these assets before the Basel III full implementation date of March 31, 2018 and are taking other actions to reduce our book balance by that date. However, no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so, or that we will be successful in selling these assets at their current fair value. If implemented today, we would experience another 263 basis points reduction in Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets) and 149 basis points reduction in the leverage ratio (Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average assets). The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. See Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, herein, for additional information regarding Basel III.\nAt December 31, 2015 our allowance for loan and lease losses was $187 million, covering 3.0 percent of total loans held-for-investment. Our estimate of the inherent losses are imperfect, the portfolio is relatively new and we are using underwriting standards which have not been in place for a long period of time.\nOur estimate of the allowance for loan and lease losses of $187 million at December 31, 2015, may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience as well as an evaluation of the risks incurred in the current portfolio. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently subjective process that requires significant management judgment including estimates of loss and the loss emergence period. We make various assumptions, estimates and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio including but not limited to the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of real estate or other collateral backing the repayment of loans. New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, failure of borrowers and guarantors to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Moreover, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Our regulators, who have access to broader industry data that we do not have, may recommend or require us to change our allowance for loan losses, based on their judgment, which may be different from that of our management or other regulators. Any increase in our loan losses could have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nConcentration of loans held-for-investment in certain geographic locations may increase risk.\nOur mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states, including California, Michigan, Florida, and Texas, which is approximately 60 percent of the portfolio. In addition, approximately 90 percent of our commercial real estate loans are in Michigan or are repayable by borrowers who have significant operations in Michigan. This concentration has made, and will continue to make, our loan portfolio particularly susceptible to downturns in the general economy and the real estate and mortgage markets. Michigan and California have had significant volatility in housing prices in the recent past. Adverse conditions beyond our control, including unemployment, inflation, recession, natural disasters, declining property values, municipal bankruptcies and other factors in these markets could increase default rates in our loan portfolio and could reduce our ability to generate new loans and otherwise negatively affect our financial results.\nIn 2015, we continued to grow our portfolio of commercial real estate and commercial industrial loans, which generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans due to the more complex nature of underwriting associated with commercial loans. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential real estate loan.\nLiquidity is essential to our business and our ability to borrow funds, maintain or increase deposits or raise capital at commercially reasonable terms or at all may adversely affect our liquidity and earnings.\nWe require substantial liquidity to meet our deposit and debt obligations as they come due, fund our operations and for potential unforeseen liabilities or losses, including without limitation those that could be incurred in connection with the settlement of litigation, regulatory proceedings or other matters. Our access to liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of deposits. Our access to external sources of financing, including deposits, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent on various factors including regulatory restrictions. A number of factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, including, but not limited to, declining financial results and losses, material changes to operating margins, financial leverage on an absolute or relative to peers, changes within the organization, specific events that impact our financial condition or reputation, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting assets, the corporate and regulatory structure, balance sheet and capital structure, geographic and business diversification, interest rate fluctuations, market share and competitive position, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing funding transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. The material deterioration in any one or a combination of these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer standing with counterparties or a decline in our reputation within the marketplace and could result in higher cash outflows requiring additional access to liquidity, having a limited ability to borrow funds, maintain or increase deposits (including custodial deposits for our agency servicing portfolio) or to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to make mortgage loans and fund our investments and operations depends largely on our ability to secure funds on terms acceptable to us. Our primary sources of funds to meet our financing needs include loan sales; deposits, which include custodial accounts from our servicing portfolio and brokered deposits and public funds; borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank or other federally backed entities; borrowings from investment and commercial banks through repurchase agreements; and capital-raising activities. If we are unable to maintain any of these financing arrangements, are restricted from accessing certain funding sources by our regulators, are unable to arrange for new financing on terms acceptable to us or at all or if we default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities, then we may have to reduce the number of mortgage loans we are able to originate for sale in the secondary market or for our own investment or take other actions that could have other negative effects on our operations. A prolonged significant reduction in loan originations that occurs as a result could adversely impact our earnings, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. There is no guarantee that we will be able to renew or maintain our financing arrangements or deposits or that we will be able to adequately access capital markets when or if a need for additional capital arises.\nIn addition, we previously provided notice to the U.S. Treasury exercising our contractual right to defer regularly scheduled quarterly payments of dividends, beginning with the February 2012 payment, on preferred stock issued and outstanding. Also, under the terms of our indenture agreements related to the trust preferred securities (\"TPS\"), we deferred interest payments since 2012 and may do so for up to 20 consecutive quarters without default or penalty. If we intend to resume interest or dividend payments on either or both the preferred stock and the trust preferred securities and do not have adequate financing at the Holding Company this would require a dividend from the Bank to the Holding Company, which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. Please see \"Regulatory Risk Factors,\" for additional risk factors on the risk of default of the TPS.\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, which assumptions and estimates may prove to be incorrect, resulting in significant declines or increases in valuation.\nA total of $4,301 million of assets and $110 million of liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value, including our MSRs, loans held-for-sale, certain loans held-for-investment, available-for-sale investment securities, derivatives, certain long-term debt and the future obligations arising from our settlement with the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices when available. In certain cases, observable market prices and data may not be readily available or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions. In such cases, we use internally developed financial models that utilize observable market data inputs as well as asset specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates to estimate the fair value of certain of these assets and liabilities. These valuation models rely to some degree on management's assumptions, estimates and judgment, which are inherently uncertain. We cannot be certain that the models or the underlying assumptions will prove to be predictive and remain so over time, and therefore, actual results may differ from our models and assumptions. Different assumptions could result in significant declines in valuation, which in turn could result in significant declines or increases in the dollar amount of assets or increases in the liabilities we report on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nRegulatory Risk\nWe and the Bank remain subject to the restrictions and conditions of the Consent Orders with the OCC and CFPB, and Supervisory Agreement with the Federal Reserve. Failure to comply with the Consent Orders or Supervisory Agreement could result in further enforcement action against us.\nThere is no guarantee that the Bank will be able to fully comply with the Consent Orders. In the event that we are in material non-compliance with the terms of the Consent Orders, the CFPB and OCC have the authority to subject the Bank to additional corrective actions. Moreover, they could initiate further enforcement actions against the Bank, seek an injunction requiring the Bank and its officers and directors to comply with the Consent Orders and seek civil money penalties against us and our officers and directors. Any failure by the Bank to comply with the terms of the Consent Orders or additional actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Bank\u2019s competitors may not be subject to similar actions, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. These corrective actions could negatively impact the Bank's operations and financial performance. See the Consent Order discussions in Item 1. Business, herein, for further details.\nWe also remain subject to the Supervisory Agreement, which requires that we take certain actions to address issues identified by the OTS. The Supervisory Agreement is enforced by the Federal Reserve as the successor regulator to the OTS with respect to savings and loan holding companies. The Supervisory Agreement requires that we submit a capital plan; receive written non-objection before declaring or paying any dividend or other capital distribution, incurring or renewing any debt and engaging in affiliate transactions (with limited exceptions); comply with applicable regulatory requirements before making certain severance and indemnification payments; and provide notice prior to changes in directors and certain executive officers or entering into, renewing, extending or revising compensation or benefits agreements of such directors or executive officers, with such changes being subject to Federal Reserve approval. While we believe that we have taken numerous steps to comply with, and intend to comply with in the future, the requirements of the Supervisory Agreement, failure to comply with the Supervisory Agreement in the time frames provided, or at all, could result in additional enforcement orders or penalties, which could include further restrictions on us, assessment of civil money penalties on us, as well as our directors, officers and other affiliated parties and removal of one or more officers and/or directors. Any failure by us to comply with the terms of the Supervisory Agreement or additional actions by the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our competitors may not be subject to similar actions, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. See the Supervisory Agreement discussion in Item 1. Business, herein, for further details.\nExpanded regulatory oversight over our business could significantly increase our risks and costs associated with complying with current and future regulations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs noted in \"Item 1 - Business - Regulation and Supervision,\" we are subject to a wide variety of banking, consumer protection and securities laws, regulations and supervisory expectations and numerous regulatory and enforcement authorities. As a result of and in addition to new legislation aimed at regulatory reform, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, and the increased capital requirements introduced by the Basel III final rules, the regulatory agencies generally are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities. We, the Bank and our products and services all remain subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations. We expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future.\nAs a result of increasing scrutiny and regulation of the banking industry and consumer practices, we may face a greater number or wider scope of examinations, investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing our costs associated with responding to or defending such actions, as well as potentially resulting in costs associated with fines, penalties, settlements or judgments. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our businesses, and any required changes to our operations resulting from these developments, could reduce our revenue, limit the products or services that we offer or increase the costs thereof, impose additional compliance costs, harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Some of these laws may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may seek to pursue to enforce these laws and regulations.\nFinancial services reform legislation has resulted in, among other things, numerous restrictions and requirements which could negatively impact our business and increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations have increased and may continue to increase our operating and compliance costs and our interest expense. In addition, compliance obligations have exposed us and will continue to expose us to additional noncompliance risk and could divert management\u2019s focus from our business operations. Furthermore, the combined effect of numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, present challenges and risks to our business and operations.\nThe CFPB has broad and unique rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers, including prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service including regulations related to the origination and servicing of residential mortgages. The concept of what may be considered to be an \"abusive\" practice is new under the law. The CFPB has also finalized a number of significant rules and guidance that impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage. The CFPB continues to revise these rules and propose new rules. Effective in 2016, the Bank is again subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations, due to reporting assets of more than $10 billion for four consecutive quarters. As a result, we could incur increased costs, potential litigation or be materially limited or restricted in our business, product offerings or services in the future.\nWe are highly dependent on the Agencies to sell mortgage loans and any changes in these entities or their current roles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell approximately 70 percent of our mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward is unclear. These roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements.\nThe elimination or modification of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these agencies, any significant adverse change in the level of activity of these agencies in the primary or secondary mortgage markets or in the underwriting criteria of these agencies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the servicing or origination guidelines required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to follow specific guidelines that impact the way that we service and originate agency loans, including guidelines with respect to credit standards for mortgage loans, our staffing levels and other servicing practices, the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge, our modification standards and procedures and the amount of non-reimbursable advances.\nWe cannot negotiate these terms with the Agencies and they are subject to change at any time. A significant change in these guidelines that has the effect of decreasing the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could also have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon having FDIC insurance to raise deposit funding at reasonable rates. Increases in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments will adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to substantially revise its regulations for determining the amount of an institution's deposit insurance premiums. The FDIC has defined the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average tangible equity. Our assessment rate is determined by use of a scorecard that combines a financial institution's Capital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity (\"CAMELS\") ratings with certain forward-looking financial information. The FDIC may determine that we present a higher risk to the DIF than other banks due to certain factors. These factors include significant risks relating to interest rates, loan portfolio and geographic concentration, concentration of high credit risk loans, increased loan losses, regulatory compliance (including under existing agreements with regulators such as the Consent Order and Supervisory Agreement), existing and future litigation and other factors. As a result, we could be subject to higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future that could adversely affect our earnings. The Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future also may be higher than competing banks may be required to pay.\nWe are a holding company and therefore dependent on the Bank for funding of obligations and dividends.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of the Bank, our ability to service our debt or preferred stock obligations, including interest payments on debentures underlying the trust preferred securities and dividend payments on the preferred shares, is dependent upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the Bank on such capital stock. The declaration and payment of dividends by the Bank on all classes of its capital stock is subject to the discretion of the Bank's board of directors and to applicable regulatory and legal limitations, including receiving approval from the OCC, compliance with the approved capital plan submitted pursuant to the Consent Order and receiving approval from the Federal Reserve. If the Bank does not make dividend payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt or preferred stock obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had accumulated deferrals for 16 consecutive quarters of interest payments due on our TPS totaling $27 million of deferred interest. We are only allowed up to 20 consecutive quarters of deferral after which we will be in default. If we default and are unable, or not allowed, to make the required payments, TPS holders could file to put the Holding Company into bankruptcy.\nWe exercised our contractual right in 2012 to defer interest payments with respect to our TPS. Under the terms of the related indentures, we may only defer interest payments for up to 20 consecutive quarters without default or penalty. As of December 31, 2015 we had deferred interest payments for 16 consecutive quarters, with the cumulative amount in arrears as of December 31, 2015 totaling $27 million. If we do not pay all deferred amounts then due by the end of the 20th quarter, i.e., by December 31, 2016, and resume current interest payments, we will be in default. There can be no assurances that we will be able, or allowed, to pay off these deferred amounts and resume making current interest payments by that time. If we default and do not cure the default through such payments, TPS holders could file to put the Holding Company into bankruptcy.\nOperational Risk\nA failure of our information technology systems, or those of our key third party vendors or service providers, could cause operational losses and damage our reputation.\nOur businesses are increasingly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions and data. If our internal financial, accounting, or other information technology systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business for a period of time, which may impact our financial results if that interruption is sustained. In addition, our reputation with our customers or counterparties may suffer, which could have a further, long-term impact on our financial results.\nAlso, because we conduct part of our business over the Internet and outsource a significant number of our critical functions to third parties, our operations depend on our third-party service providers to maintain and operate their own technology systems. To the extent these third parties\u2019 systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business or provide certain services, and we may face financial and reputational losses as a result.\nWe collect, store and transfer our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, and any compromise to the security of that information may have meaningful consequences for us.\nData breaches are of a particular concern as in the processing of consumer transactions, our businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. There are a myriad of federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data.\nWe have policies and processes in place that are intended to meet the requirements of those laws, including security systems in place to prevent unauthorized access to that information. Nevertheless, those processes and systems may be inadequate. Also, to the extent we rely upon third parties to handle personally identifiable data on our behalf, we may be responsible if such data is compromised while in the custody and control of those third parties.\nPrivacy laws are still evolving, and many local jurisdictions have laws that differ from federal law. At times, we may also be governed by privacy laws outside the U.S., with which we are less familiar. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data, those events could damage the reputation of our business, and discourage potential users from utilizing our products and services. In addition, we may have to bear the cost of mitigating identity theft concerns, and may additionally be subject to fines or legal proceedings by governmental agencies or consumers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nWe act as servicer and subservicer for mortgage loans owned by third parties, which is approximately 10 percent of our revenue and $1.2 billion of our average deposits. In such capacities for those loans, we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims for which we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or increase to noninterest expense. We may incur significant costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold by us, we make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the Agencies, about the mortgage loans, and the manner in which they were originated. We have made, and will continue to make, such representations and warranties in connection with the sale of loans. Whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan or we may be required to pay fees. We also are subject to litigation relating to these representations and warranties and the costs of such litigation may be significant. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies we have available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. In addition, we also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims, the liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected.\nOur representation and warranty reserve for losses at December 31, 2015 is $40 million. This may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized into the secondary market which we may be subsequently required to repurchase, pay fines or fees, or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties. In addition, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our representation and warranty reserve for losses. Our regulators may recommend or require us to increase our reserve, based on their judgment, which may be different from that of our management. Any increase in our loan losses could have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nWe utilize third party mortgage originators over whom we have less control which may expose us to risk.\nWe rely on third party mortgage originators to make and document the mortgage loans we purchase. While we perform investigations on the mortgage companies with whom we do business and review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance, we have less control over these originators than employees of the Bank. Our ability to control the third party mortgage originators could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, these arrangements with third party mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions in the future.\nOur mortgage volume may be impacted by our use of third party mortgage originators.\nApproximately 95 percent of our residential first mortgage volume depends upon the use of third party mortgage originators, who are not our employees. These third parties originate mortgages and provide services to many different banks and other entities. Accordingly, they may have relationships with or loyalties to such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us. Failure to maintain good relations with such third party mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our net income.\nDue to increasing regulatory scrutiny, our third party mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether. This could lead to a decrease in our mortgage volume.\nOur financial results fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of our business and seasonality, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur mortgage origination business is subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market. Cyclicality in our industry could lead to periods of strong growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of sharp declines and losses in such markets. One of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans in our market areas, which is affected by prevailing interest rates. If we are unable to respond to the cyclicality of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations, headcount and overhead, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. Although in recent periods the broader cyclical trends in the mortgage and real estate markets have disrupted the customary historical seasonal trends, such seasonal trends could resume in the future, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and make it difficult to predict our future operating performance. Furthermore, Basel III also provides for a countercyclical capital buffer to induce banking organizations to hold capital in excess of regulatory minimums.\nWhile we recently reversed the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, we may not be able to realize these assets or may have to establish a valuation allowance in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nManagement assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets at each reporting period and currently has no valuation allowance related to federal deferred tax assets and a valuation of allowance of $22 million related to state taxes. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred taxes represents our best estimate as described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, herein. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nMP Thrift, an entity managed and controlled by MatlinPatterson, owns 63.1 percent of our common stock and has significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, whether or not such decisions are in the best interests of other stockholders.\nMP Thrift owns a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock and as a result, has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and also the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or the stockholders regardless of whether or not other members of our board of directors or stockholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. So long as MP Thrift continues to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and other matters being voted on, and continue to exert significant influence over us. Furthermore, MP Thrift may have interests that could diverge from the interests of other stockholders, and may use its control to make decisions that adversely affect the interest of other common stockholders and other holders of our debt or other equity instruments.\nAdditionally, our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation\u2019s net operating losses, certain recognized built-in losses, and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs. As we have a controlling stockholder, any stock offering in isolation or when combined with other ownership changes, could cause us to experience an ownership change. If an ownership change were to occur, we believe it could cause us to permanently lose the ability to realize a portion of our net operating losses (\"NOL\") related deferred tax asset, resulting in reduction to total stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe are subject to a number of legal or regulatory proceedings, therefore making them difficult to predict.\nAt any given time, we are defending ourselves against a number of legal and regulatory investigating and proceedings. Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on our business activities or other results adverse to\nus, which could materially and negatively affect our businesses. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. In addition, some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We also have been, and may continue to be in the future, subject to stockholder derivative actions, which could seek significant damages or other relief. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations relating to our business and operations. The results of these legal and regulatory proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.\nFor a further discussion of the unpredictability of legal proceedings and description of certain of our pending legal proceedings, see Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, herein.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe above description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described in any such report or document. Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 84734, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "FBC"}
