{"cik": "1497504", "company": "Dipexium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Dipexium\nWe have never generated revenues and do not expect to in the near future. We have a history of operating losses, expects continuing losses and may never become profitable.\nIn order to generate revenue, we must develop and commercialize successfully our own product or enter into strategic partnering agreements with others who can develop and commercialize them successfully, or acquire additional new products that generate or have the potential to generate revenues. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development program and our ability to acquire new products, we are unable to predict when we will be able to generate significant revenue or become profitable, if at all. We incurred a net loss of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $62.4 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial and continuing losses for the foreseeable future. These losses will increase if we decide to pursue clinical trials of Locilex\u00ae in yet to be identified, new clinical indications or if we were to in-license new products that require further development. Even if our Locilex\u00ae or any new products we may acquire or in-license are introduced commercially, we may never achieve market acceptance and may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain future profitability.\nBecause we have no source of revenue, we must depend on financing or partnering to sustain our operations. We likely will need to raise substantial additional capital or enter into strategic partnering agreements to fund our operations and we are very likely unable to raise such funds or enter into strategic partnering agreements when needed and on acceptable terms because our lead and only product candidate recently failed in Phase 3 clinical trials.\nDeveloping products requires substantial amounts of capital. We have not yet identified a potential new clinical and regulatory pathway forward for Locilex\u00ae and therefore cannot estimate the cost of any such pathway to market. If we are not able to identify a promising clinical and regulatory pathway forward, it is likely that we will need to raise substantial additional capital or enter into strategic partnering agreements to fund our operations and it may be unable to raise such funds or enter into strategic partnering agreements when needed and on acceptable terms, particularly given that Locilex\u00ae has recently failed in two Phase 3 clinical trials.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7 the ability to identify a clinical and regulatory pathway forward for Locilex\u00ae given the recent failure in Phase 3 clinical trials in infected diabetic foot ulcers;\n\u00b7 the progress, timing, cost and results of our yet-to-be identified clinical development program if we decide to pursue them;\n\u00b7 the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory actions with respect to our product;\n\u00b7 the success, progress, timing and costs of our business development efforts to implement business collaborations, licenses and other business combinations or transactions, and our efforts to evaluate various strategic alternatives available with respect to our product.\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire or in-license additional new products and technologies and the costs and expenses of such acquisitions or licenses;\n\u00b7 the timing and amount of any royalties, milestone or other payments we may receive from or be obligated to pay to potential licensors, licensees and other third parties;\n\u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 the emergence of competing products and technologies, and other adverse market developments;\n\u00b7 the perceived, potential and actual commercial success of our product;\n\u00b7 our operating expenses; and\n\u00b7 the resolution of our pending litigation and any amount it may be required to pay in excess of our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nOur future capital requirements and projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties, and actual requirements and expenditures may differ significantly from our projections. To date, we have relied entirely upon proceeds from sales of our equity securities to finance our business and operations. We likely will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. As of December 31, 2016, Dipexium had $16.7 million of cash. We do not have any existing credit facilities under which we may borrow funds. Absent the receipt of any licensing income or financing, we expect our cash balance to decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations. Assuming the Proposed Merger is completed during the first half of 2017, we expect our cash as of December 31, 2016 to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the anticipated close of the Proposed Merger, including the closing condition under the Merger Agreement to have at least $12.0 million of \u201ccash,\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement, available upon the closing of the Proposed Merger. If the Proposed Merger is not completed, we will need to reevaluate our strategic alternatives, which may include continuing to operate our business as an independent, stand-alone company, a sale of the company, liquidation of the company or other strategic transaction. Our liquidity position will be dependent upon the strategic alternative selected; however, assuming we do not enter into another strategic transaction, we expect our cash as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. Additional financing would be required should we decide to commence a new clinical program for Locilex\u00ae in a new, yet-to-be-identified clinical indication. Cash needs to pursue a new clinical indication cannot even be estimated until a promising new indication for Locilex\u00ae to target is identified, if ever.\nThe October 2016 announcement of the disappointing results of our prior completed OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 Phase 3 clinical trials has significantly depressed the trading price of our common stock and harmed our ability to raise additional capital. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe and our management are parties to a lawsuit which, if adversely decided against, could impact our rights to Locilex\u00ae.\nIn April 2010, we acquired the worldwide rights to develop pexiganan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Locilex\u00ae, from Genaera Liquidating Trust, which was put in place to liquidate the assets of Genaera Corporation. In June 2012, we, along with our two senior executives and several other unrelated defendants, were sued in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by a former shareholder of Genaera Corporation and purported to be on behalf of other Genaera Corporation shareholders, alleging, in pertinent part, that our company\u2019s acquisition of the rights to pexiganan (the active ingredient in Locilex\u00ae, and which rights included the rights to the prior formulation of Locilex\u00ae) was for what was alleged to be inadequate consideration, and as a result, it was alleged that we and our senior executives aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty by Genaera Corporation and the Genaera Liquidating Trust to the former shareholders of Genaera Corporation. It was also alleged that we and our senior executives aided and abetted a breach of the duty of the trustee at common law and under a certain trust agreement which was alleged to exist and which was executed by Argyce LLC (or Argyce), as trustee. The agreement called for Argyce to create the Genaera Liquidating Trust pursuant to which Argyce apparently was appointed to liquidate the assets formerly held by Genaera Corporation. One of these assets was pexiganan, which we acquired via public auction conducted by Argyce on behalf of the Genaera Liquidating Trust.\nThe case against our company and our senior executives was dismissed with prejudice by the Federal District Court, without leave to refile, on August 12, 2013 based on the argument that Plaintiff\u2019s claims were time barred, and a subsequent motion to reconsider such dismissal was denied by the Federal District Court. Prior to the dismissal there was no request or action to seek class certification by the plaintiff though it was purportedly filed on behalf of other former Genaera Corporation shareholders. Plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the suit as well as the denial of the motion to reconsider to the Third Circuit Appellate Court, which granted Plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\nOn October 17, 2014, the Third Circuit Appellate Court, in a 2-1 decision with a strong dissenting opinion, reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiff\u2019s claims based on the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation and remanded the case to the Federal District Court. In a 2-1 decision, the Third Circuit held that more information was necessary to determine when Plaintiff should have been on notice of his claims to determine the applicability of the discovery rule, which could serve to extend the time frame in which Plaintiff could bring his claims. Due to the strong dissent, all Defendants filed the necessary documents requesting a petition for rehearing en banc, by the majority of the Third Circuit justices who are in active service. The Third Circuit denied the request for en banc hearing and remanded this case to District Court.\nUpon remand to the Federal District Court, all Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for reasons other than being time barred. The Company and the executives moved for dismissal based on Plaintiff\u2019s inability to make a case for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty because there was no underlying breach and such an aiding and abetting claim requires an element of knowing participation in the fiduciary breach which cannot be established by Plaintiff.\nThe District Court held a hearing on this in September 2015 and the District Court delivered an Order on November 10, 2015 pursuant to which the District Court granted the Motion to Dismiss filed by each and every defendant including the Company and its executives. In December 2015, Plaintiff appealed the Federal District Court\u2019s decision to the Third Circuit Appellate Court and we anticipate a decision on whether to grant Plaintiff\u2019s appeal by the Third Circuit Appellate Court in the first quarter of 2017. The Company will continue to vigorously defend Plaintiff\u2019s claims on the factual record, which it believes will prove that the Company is not liable to the Plaintiff in any regard.\nIf we were to lose such case, our rights to the prior formulation of Locilex\u00ae could be lost, which may impair the commercial viability of our product or the timeline to potential regulatory approval. If we were required to settle the case, we may lose certain rights to Locilex\u00ae or be required to pay damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our company, our business plans and results of operations.\nOur two pivotal OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 clinical trials did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints, which could continue to harm our business and further disappoint our stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to continue to decrease.\nOur lead and only product in development is Locilex\u00ae for the treatment of mildly infected diabetic foot ulcers, for which there is currently no FDA-approved product. In October 2016, we announced disappointing top-line data from our OneStep-1 and OneStep-2 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials and both trials failed to meet any of the primary or secondary endpoints. Currently, management in conjunction with its clinical and regulatory advisors have not been able to identify a new clinical and regulatory pathway forward although this is subject to ongoing review and evaluation. No assurance can be given that a promising clinical and regulatory pathway will be identified or that, if identified, any such pathway could be achieved, without significantly more capital invested in the Company. No assurance can be given that additional capital would be available or that such capital would be available at acceptable terms.\nWe have not yet identified a clinical or regulatory pathway forward for Locilex\u00ae, our only product, and the likelihood is that Locilex\u00ae will not be approved by regulatory authorities or introduced commercially for at least several years, if at all.\nIn October 2016, we released top-line data on our only ongoing clinical trials, OneStep-1 and OneStep-2, which were two identical Phase 3 clincial trials testing Locilex\u00ae in patients with mildly infected diabetic foot ulcers. Both trials failed to meet all primary and secondary endpoints. We currently are evaluating whether or not there is any clinical and regulatory pathway forward based on the data from the OneStep trials. Going forward, Locilex\u00ae will require further development, preclinical and clinical testing and investment prior to obtaining required regulatory approvals, if ever, and commercialization in the United States and abroad, even if a viable regulatory pathway forward is identified. We currently have no other product candidates. We cannot provide assurance that a new clinical and regulatory pathway will be identified or that Locilex\u00ae will be developed successfully. Even if a viable clinical and regulatory pathway forward is identified, we cannot provide assurance that Locilex\u00ae will:\n\u00b7 prove to be safe and effective in clinical studies;\n\u00b7 meet applicable regulatory standards or obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 demonstrate substantial protective or therapeutic benefits in the prevention or treatment of any disease;\n\u00b7 be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs;\n\u00b7 obtain coverage and favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and other third-party payors; or\n\u00b7 be marketed successfully or achieve market acceptance by physicians and patients.\nIf we reallocate our resources to acquire one or more new product candidates, we may not be successful in developing such newly acquired product candidates and we will once again be subject to all the risks and uncertainties associated with research and development of products and technologies.\nWe have explored the possibility of reallocating our resources toward acquiring, by acquisition or in-license, new product candidates. If we decide to acquire one or more new product candidates, we cannot guarantee that any such acquisition would result in the identification and successful development of one or more approved and commercially viable products. The development of products and technologies is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 the time, costs and uncertainty associated with the clinical testing required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the ability to raise sufficient funds to fund the research and development of any one or more new product candidates;\n\u00b7 the ability to find third party strategic partners to assist or share in the costs of product development, and potential dependence on such strategic partners, to the extent Dipexium may rely on strategic partners for future sales, marketing or distribution;\n\u00b7 the ability to protect the intellectual property rights associated with any one or more new product candidates;\n\u00b7 litigation;\n\u00b7 competition;\n\u00b7 ability to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 government restrictions on the pricing and profitability of products in the United States and elsewhere; and\n\u00b7 the extent to which third-party payers, including government agencies, private health care insurers and other health care payers, such as health maintenance organizations, and self-insured employee plans, will cover and pay for newly approved therapies.\nWe have very limited staffing and we are dependent upon key employees and the limited use of independent contractors, the loss of some of which could affect adversely our operations.\nOur success is dependent upon the efforts of a relatively small management team and staff. We also have engaged independent contractors from time-to-time on an as needed, project by project, basis. During November 2016, in order to reduce our operating expenses, we terminated all of our major independent contractor arrangements and reduced the total employee headcount. Such reductions in force, combined with our future business prospects and financial condition, put us at risk of losing key personnel who we will need going forward to implement our business strategies. We have no redundancy of personnel in key development areas, including clinical, regulatory, strategic planning and finance. We have employment arrangements in place with our executive and other officers, but none of these executive and other officers is bound legally to remain employed with us for any specific term. We do not have key man life insurance policies covering our executive and other officers or any of our other employees. If key individuals leave our company, our business could be affected adversely if suitable replacement personnel are not recruited quickly. There is competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry in the New York, New York area in all functional areas, which makes it difficult to retain and attract the qualified personnel necessary for any potential turn around or restart of our business. Our financial condition and recent reductions in force and expense reductions may make it difficult for us to retain current personnel and attract qualified employees and independent contractors in the future.\nOur business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that could affect adversely our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state governments as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, continue to issue new requirements and regulations in response to laws enacted by Congress. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from our other business activities.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nThe price of our common stock has dropped dramatically since the failure of our OneStep Phase 3 clinical trials, OneStep-1 and OneStep-2, in October 2016 and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, the sale price of our common stock ranged from $12.38 per share to $1.60 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7 general stock market and general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, not directly related to our company or our business;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated governmental agency actions, including in particular decisions or actions by the FDA or FDA advisory committee panels with respect to other antibiotic candidates in development;\n\u00b7 termination of the previously announced Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma;\n\u00b7 entering into new strategic partnering arrangements;\n\u00b7 developments concerning our efforts to identify and implement strategic opportunities and the terms and timing of any resulting transactions;\n\u00b7 public concern as to the safety or efficacy of or market acceptance of products developed by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 our cash and our need and ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u00b7 equity sales by us to fund our operations;\n\u00b7 the resolution of our pending litigation matter;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results, including our cash, operating expenses, cash burn rate or revenues;\n\u00b7 loss of key management;\n\u00b7 common stock sales and purchases in the public market by one or more of our larger stockholders, officers or directors;\n\u00b7 reports issued by securities analysts regarding our common stock and articles published regarding our business and/or products;\n\u00b7 changes in the market valuations of other life science or biotechnology companies; and\n\u00b7 other financial announcements, including delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Capital Market, review of any of our filings by the SEC, changes in accounting treatment or restatement of previously reported financial results, delays in our filings with the SEC or our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.\nIn addition, the occurrence of any of the risks described in this report or in subsequent reports we file with or submit to the SEC from time to time could have a material and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation is sometimes brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of our securities or for other reasons. Securities litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future; and, therefore, any return on an investment in our common stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future; and, therefore, any return on an investment in our common stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger between us and PLx Pharma\nOur stockholders and the stockholders of PLx Pharma may not approve the Proposed Merger of the two companies.\nWe have signed a Merger Agreement with PLx Pharma, pursuant to which we have agreed to merge with PLx Pharma subject to among other closing conditions, the approval of the stockholders of both companies. Although we believe the Proposed Merger is in the best interests of our and PLx Pharma\u2019s stockholders, one or both companies may not be able to obtain the stockholder vote required to approve the Proposed Merger. If our stockholders or the stockholders of PLx Pharma do not approve the Proposed Merger, we will pursue other strategic alternatives or potentially pursue a dissolution our company.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock to PLx Pharma stockholders in connection with the Proposed Merger will dilute substantially the voting power of our current stockholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, it is anticipated that we will issue shares of our common stock to PLx Pharma stockholders representing approximately 76% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company as of immediately following completion of the Proposed Merger, assuming our cash is $12.5 million as of the determination date. After such issuance, the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to completion of the Proposed Merger will represent 23.25% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company as of immediately following completion of the Proposed Merger. These ownership percentages may change depending upon the amount of our cash as of a determination date prior to completion of the Proposed Merger. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of our common stock to PLx Pharma stockholders in connection with the Proposed Merger will reduce significantly the relative voting power of each share of our common stock held by our current stockholders. Consequently, our stockholders as a group will have significantly less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the completion of the Proposed Merger than prior to completion of the Proposed Merger.\nThe exchange ratio in the Merger Agreement is subject to adjustment based on our cash as of a determination date prior to completion of the Proposed Merger, which could dilute further the ownership of our stockholders in the combined company.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of and as a result of the Proposed Merger, each share of PLx Pharma capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Proposed Merger will be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of our common stock, if any, as determined pursuant to the exchange ratio described in the Merger Agreement. The exchange ratio is subject to potential adjustment as described in the Merger Agreement depending upon the amount of our \u201ccash,\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement and generally consisting of our cash including certain credits for deal-related expenses and security deposits, as of a determination date prior to the closing date of the Proposed Merger. If we have more than $12.5 million of cash as of the determination date, then the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be 23.25% in the combined company. If we have less than $12.5 million of cash as of the determination date but more than $12.0 million, then the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be 22.5% of the combined company, which would constitute further dilution for our stockholders in the combined company. In addition, one of the conditions to PLx Pharma\u2019s obligations to complete the Proposed Merger is our cash as of the closing date being no less than $12.0 million as calculated and as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement. The items that will constitute our cash at the determination date set forth in the Merger Agreement are subject to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control and many of which are outside the control of PLx Pharma.\nThe exchange ratio is not adjustable based on issuances by us of additional shares of our common stock either upon the exercise of options or warrants or otherwise, which issuances would result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 1,445,013 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 10,500 shares of our common stock. We are not prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement from issuing additional equity securities under certain circumstances, including securities issued pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or to certain vendors or suppliers. It is possible that prior to completion of the Proposed Merger, we may issue additional equity securities, which would result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock following the Proposed Merger may decline as a result of the Proposed Merger.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Proposed Merger for a number of reasons, including if:\n\u00b7 investors react negatively to the prospects of the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects from the Proposed Merger;\n\u00b7 third parties may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Proposed Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise;\n\u00b7 the effect of the Proposed Merger on the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u00b7 the combined organization does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Proposed Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nFailure to complete the Proposed Merger could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nThe completion of the Proposed Merger is subject to a number of conditions and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Proposed Merger will be satisfied. If the Proposed Merger is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including:\n\u00b7 the current trading price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the Proposed Merger will occur, meaning that a failure to complete the Proposed Merger could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock;\n\u00b7 certain of our executive officers and/or directors may seek other employment opportunities, and the departure of any of our executive officers and the possibility that the Company would be unable to recruit and hire an executive could impact negatively our business and operating result;\n\u00b7 our board of directors will need to reevaluate our strategic alternatives, which alternatives may include a sale of the Company, liquidation of the Company or other strategic transaction;\n\u00b7 we may be required to pay a termination fee of $700,000 to PLx Pharma if the Merger Agreement is terminated by PLx Pharma or by us under certain circumstances;\n\u00b7 we have incurred and are expected to continue to incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the Proposed Merger whether or not the Proposed Merger is completed;\n\u00b7 we would not realize any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the Proposed Merger; and\n\u00b7 pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Proposed Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and affect materially and adversely our business, financial condition, results of operations, or the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Proposed Merger, some of which will be required to be paid even if the Proposed Merger is not completed.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Proposed Merger. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of our attorneys, accountants and financial advisors. We will be required to pay most of these costs even if the Proposed Merger is not completed. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to certain triggering events specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay PLx Pharma a termination fee of $700,000. The Merger Agreement also provides that under specified circumstances, if the Proposed Merger is completed, the combined company will bear our transaction costs as well as those of PLx Pharma in connection with the Proposed Merger, including financial advisor, legal and accounting fees and expenses.\nThird party lawsuits may be filed against us in connection with the Proposed Merger which may be frivolous but costly to defend.\nThird parties may assert claims against us alleging that the terms of the Proposed Merger are somehow unfair or inappropriate. Although our board of directors and management team may disagree, any claims against us, with or without merit, as well as claims initiated by us against third parties, can be time-consuming and expensive to defend or prosecute and resolve. We cannot assure you that litigation asserting claims against the Company will not be initiated or that we would prevail in any litigation. We cannot assure you that the Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma would close if and to the extent a claim or claims were filed against the Company in this regard.\nBecause the Proposed Merger will be completed after the date of our annual meeting of stockholders, it is possible under certain limited circumstances described below that at the time of the annual meeting, our stockholders will not know the exact number of shares of our common stock that the PLx Pharma stockholders will receive upon completion of the Proposed Merger.\nSubject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Proposed Merger, each share of PLx Pharma common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Proposed Merger will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive that number of shares of our common stock as determined pursuant to the exchange ratio described in the Merger Agreement. The exchange ratio depends on our cash as of a determination date prior to completion of the Proposed Merger. The determination date is defined as the date that is three days prior to the closing date. Under the Merger Agreement, our \u201ccash\u201d is defined as generally consisting of our cash plus certain credits for transaction-related costs and security deposits, as of a determination date prior to the closing date of the Proposed Merger.\nSome of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Proposed Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.\nWhen considering the recommendation by our board of directors that our stockholders vote \u201cfor\u201d each of the proposals being submitted to our stockholders at the annual meeting of our stockholders, our stockholders should be aware that certain of our directors and executive officers have arrangements that provide them with interests in the Proposed Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders. For instance, in connection with the Proposed Merger, David P. Luci, Esq., Dipexium\u2019s President & CEO and a current member of our board of directors, will continue to serve as a director of the combined company following completion of the Proposed Merger and will receive cash and equity compensation in consideration for such service. The employment of our three executive officers will terminate immediately following completion of the Proposed Merger and they will be entitled to receive severance cash payments ranging from $213,000 to $1,238,000, and other severance benefits such as continuing health insurance, in connection with such termination. Our directors and executive officers also have certain rights to indemnification and to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that will be provided by the combined company following completion of the Proposed Merger. Our board of directors was aware of these potential interests and considered them in making its recommendations to approve the proposals being submitted to our stockholders at the special meeting of our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of us and PLx Pharma from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when our board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior takeover proposal and is reasonably capable of being consummated and that failure to cooperate with the proponent of the proposal could reasonably be considered a breach of our board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties. The PLx Pharma board of directors is not permitted under any circumstances to solicit alternative takeover proposals or cooperate with any person making unsolicited takeover proposals. In addition, if we or PLx Pharma terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, we or PLx Pharma would be required to pay a termination fee of $700,000 or $500,000, respectively, to the other party. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals to us or PLx Pharma or their stockholders, and may cause the respective boards of directors to be less inclined to recommend an alternative proposal.\nBecause the lack of a public market for shares of PLx Pharma capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Proposed Merger, PLx Pharma stockholders may receive consideration in the Proposed Merger that is greater than the fair value of the shares of capital stock of PLx Pharma.\nPLx Pharma is privately held and its outstanding capital stock is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair value of PLx Pharma or its shares of capital stock. Since the percentage of PLx Pharma\u2019s equity to be issued to the PLx Pharma stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Proposed Merger will be greater than the fair value of PLx Pharma.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Proposed Merger without resoliciting stockholder approval for the Proposed Merger.\nCertain conditions to our obligations to complete the Proposed Merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement between us and PLx Pharma. In the event of a waiver of a condition, our board of directors will evaluate the materiality of any such waiver to determine whether amendment of the proxy statement/prospectus and resolicitation of proxies is necessary. In the event that our board of directors determines any such waiver is not significant enough to require resolicitation of stockholders, it will have the discretion to complete the Proposed Merger without seeking further stockholder approval. The conditions requiring the approval of each company\u2019s stockholders cannot, however, be waived.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company if the Proposed Merger is Completed\nThe success of the Proposed Merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company following completion of the Proposed Merger to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our business with the business of PLx Pharma.\nThe Proposed Merger involves the integration of two companies that previously have operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations. Due to legal restrictions, we and PLx Pharma are able to conduct only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies prior to completion of the Proposed Merger. Significant management attention and resources will be required to integrate the two companies after completion of the Proposed Merger. The failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7 using the combined company\u2019s cash and other assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company;\n\u00b7 appropriately managing the liabilities of the combined company;\n\u00b7 potential unknown or currently unquantifiable liabilities associated with the Proposed Merger and the operations of the combined company;\n\u00b7 potential unknown and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Proposed Merger; and\n\u00b7 performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the Proposed Merger and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nDelays in the integration process could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial results, financial condition and stock price following the Proposed Merger. Even if the combined company were able to integrate the business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration and that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time.\nThe Proposed Merger will result in changes to the combined company\u2019s board of directors and the combined company may pursue different strategies than we may have pursued independently.\nIf we and PLx Pharma complete the Proposed Merger, the composition of the combined company\u2019s board of directors will change in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Following completion of the Proposed Merger, the combined company\u2019s board of directors will consist of seven members, including David P. Luci, Esq., our President & CEO, from our current board of directors. Currently, it is anticipated that the combined company will continue to advance the product development efforts and business strategies of PLx Pharma. However, because the composition of the board of directors of the combined company will consist of directors from both our company and PLx Pharma, the combined company may determine to pursue certain business strategies that we would not have pursued independently.\nOwnership of the combined company\u2019s common stock may be highly concentrated, and it may prevent our stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause the combined company\u2019s stock price to decline.\nUpon completion of the Proposed Merger, PLx Pharma\u2019s directors, executive officers continuing with the combined company and stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, are expected to beneficially own or control a majority of the combined company. Accordingly, these directors, executive officers and their affiliates and stockholders, acting individually or as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action of the combined company requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the combined company\u2019s assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders also may exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of the combined company, even if such change in control would benefit the other stockholders of the combined company. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may affect adversely the market value of the combined company\u2019s common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nThe combined company\u2019s ability to utilize our or PLx Pharma\u2019s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future is subject to substantial limitations and may be further limited as a result of the Proposed Merger.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Further, if our historic business is not treated as being continued by the combined entity for the two-year period beginning on the date of the Proposed Merger (referred to as the \u201ccontinuity of business requirement\u201d), the pre-transaction net operating loss carryforward deductions become substantially reduced or unavailable for use by the surviving corporation in the transaction. It is expected that the Proposed Merger with PLx Pharma will result in an \u201cownership change\u201d of our company. Accordingly, the combined company\u2019s ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be substantially limited. These limitations, in turn, could result in increased future tax payments for the combined company, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the combined company.\nUnder Section 384 of the Code, available net operating loss carryovers of ours or PLx Pharma may not be available to offset certain gains arising after the Proposed Merger from assets held by the other corporation at the effective time of the Proposed Merger. This limitation will apply to the extent that the gain is attributable to an unrealized built-in-gain in our assets or the assets of PLx Pharma existing at the effective time of the Proposed Merger. To the extent that any such gains are recognized in the five year period after the Proposed Merger upon the disposition of any such assets, the net operating loss carryovers of the other corporation will not be available to offset such gains (but the net operating loss carryovers of the corporation that owned such assets will not be limited by Section 384 although they may be subject to other limitations under Section 382 as described above).\nThe price of our common stock after the Proposed Merger is completed may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the price of our common stock.\nOur business differs significantly from the business of PLx Pharma and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the trading price of the combined company\u2019s common stock following completion of the Proposed Merger may be affected significantly by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of our ongoing operations.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market considers the anticipated Proposed Merger of Dipexium and PLx Pharma to be a business combination with a non-NASDAQ entity, resulting in a change in control of our company; and, therefore, has required that we submit a new initial listing application, which requires certain actions on the part of the combined company which may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, could make it more difficult for holders of shares of the combined company to sell their shares.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market considers the Proposed Merger to be a business combination with a non-NASDAQ entity, resulting in a change in control of our company and has required that we submit a new initial listing application. The NASDAQ Capital Market may not approve our new initial listing application for The NASDAQ Capital Market on a timely basis, or at all. If this occurs and the Proposed Merger is still completed, stockholders may have difficulty converting their investments into cash effectively. Additionally, as part of the new initial listing application, we may be required to submit, among other things, a plan for the combined company to effect a reverse stock split. A reverse stock split likely would increase the per share trading price by an as yet undetermined multiple. The change in share price may affect the volatility and liquidity of the combined company\u2019s stock, as well as the marketplace\u2019s perception of the stock. As a result, the relative price of the combined company\u2019s stock may decline and/or fluctuate more than in the past, and stockholders may have trouble converting their investments in the combined company into cash effectively.\nThe combined company\u2019s management will be required to devote substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, the combined company will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that PLx Pharma did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Capital Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. The combined company\u2019s management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Certain members of PLx Pharma\u2019s management, which will continue as the management of the combined company, do not have significant experience in addressing these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase the combined company\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs relative to those of PLx Pharma and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nAfter completion of the Proposed Merger, the combined company will possess not only all of the assets but also all of the liabilities of ours and of PLx Pharma. Discovery of previously undisclosed or unknown liabilities could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAcquisitions involve risks, including inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems. After completion of the Proposed Merger, the combined company will possess not only all of the assets, but also all of the liabilities of both companies. Although we conducted a due diligence investigation of PLx Pharma and its known and potential liabilities and obligations, and PLx Pharma conducted a due diligence investigation of our company and its known and potential liabilities and obligations, it is possible that undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems may arise after completion of the Proposed Merger, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe and PLx Pharma do not anticipate that the combined company will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that the combined company will retain its future earnings to fund the development and growth of the combined organization\u2019s business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of the common stock of the combined organization will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the combined company charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the combined company more difficult and may prevent attempts by the combined company stockholders to replace or remove the combined company management.\nProvisions in the combined company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. In addition, because the combined company will be incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding combined company voting stock from merging or combining with the combined company. Although we and PLx Pharma believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with the combined company\u2019s board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the combined company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nFuture sales of common stock by our existing or PLx Pharma\u2019s existing stockholders may cause the price of common stock to fall.\nFor the six-month period ended December 31, 2016, the average daily trading volume of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market has been approximately 500,000 shares. Subject to the lock-up agreements entered into between each of us and PLx Pharma and certain of each other\u2019s stockholders, if our existing stockholders or PLx Pharma\u2019s stockholders receiving shares of our common stock in the Proposed Merger sell substantial amounts of the combined company\u2019s common stock in the public market, or investors perceive that these sales could occur, the market price of such common stock could decrease significantly.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to achieve commercial success depends to a material extent on our ability to maintain adequate intellectual property protection for our products and technology. If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property rights for Locilex\u00ae, it may materially and adversely affect our ability to market and generate sales of the product.\nDue to the exclusivity that intellectual property protection can afford, our commercial success depends to a material extent on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection for Locilex\u00ae (and any other products we may develop in the future) in the U.S. and other countries.\nAs of January 8, 2017, our patent estate included a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409), corresponding granted patents in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Israel, Europe and Japan, as well as corresponding applications pending in Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Indonesia, Mexico, Singapore and South Africa. We also have an exclusive sublicense from Scripps Research Institute (or Scripps) , the inventor of the pexiganan technology, to a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231), directed to pexiganan, the API used in Locilex\u00ae. We consider our U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409, which relates to our new, proprietary formulation of Locilex\u00ae and methods of using it to treat skin or wound infection, to be particularly important to our company primarily due to its substantially longer patent term coverage, its novel attributes as a topical formulation, its potentially broader scope of coverage and its opportunity for foreign patent protection. While we currently have pending applications in foreign jurisdictions corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409, no assurance can be given that any foreign patents will issue, or that even if any such patents were to issue, such patents would provide meaningful protection for Locilex\u00ae.\nOur patent estate related to Locilex\u00ae is critical to our commercial viability. There is a risk that our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and that any of our issued patents will not include claims that are sufficiently broad to provide adequate protection for Locilex\u00ae, including meaningful protection from our competitors. Additionally, the success of an application for the patent term extension of our licensed patent will require the cooperation of the licensor, which cooperation cannot be guaranteed. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that Locilex\u00ae (and any other products we may develop in the future) is covered by valid and enforceable patents that are of sufficient scope to effectively prevent competitive products or are effectively maintained as trade secrets within our organization. If third parties disclose or misappropriate or design around our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.\nWe apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or improvements in our technologies in a timely fashion, or at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. Moreover, the patent positions of numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, no assurances can be given that:\n\u2022 we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies by inventing around our claims;\n\u2022 a third party will not challenge our proprietary rights, and if challenged that a court will hold that our patents are valid and enforceable;\n\u2022 any patents issued to us or our collaboration partners will cover our product as ultimately developed, or provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022 we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u2022 the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, on September 16, 2011, President Obama signed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act which codifies several significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including, among other things, changing from a \u201cfirst to invent\u2019 to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system, limiting where a patentee may file a patent suit, eventually eliminating interference proceedings while maintaining derivation actions, and creating a set of procedures to challenge patents in the USPTO after they have issued. The effects of these changes are currently uncertain as the USPTO has just implemented regulations related to these changes and the courts have yet to address many of these provisions in the context of a dispute. Furthermore, we have not assessed the applicability of the act and new regulations on the specific patents discussed herein. The U.S. Supreme Court has also issued decisions, the full impact of which is not yet known. For example, on March 20, 2012 in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. The decision appears to impact diagnostics patents that merely apply a law of nature via a series of routine steps and it has created uncertainty around the ability to patent certain biomarker-related method claims. Additionally, on June 13, 2013 in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Court held that claims to isolated genomic DNA are not patentable, but claims to complementary DNA (or cDNA) molecules were held to be valid. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain.\nWe are dependent on a third party to maintain the patent exclusivity for the API in Locilex\u00ae\nWe hold an exclusive, worldwide sublicense to the composition-of-matter patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231, which could have expired in June 2016 without the interim patent term restoration which we received from the USPTO in June 2016. Our rights to practice the pexiganan technology are derived through a license agreement between Scripps and Multiple Peptide Systems Inc. (or MPS). MPS subsequently sublicensed the pexiganan technology to the prior sponsor of the pexiganan clinical and regulatory program. On October 1, 1996, both the license agreement and sublicense agreement were amended by the parties to confirm that the license and sublicense were fully-paid and royalty-free with no further economic obligations for the practice of the pexiganan technology.\nIn June 2016, we received the cooperation of Scripps and filed an interim patent extension of U.S Patent No. 5,912,231 under the Hatch Waxman Act which was approved by the USPTO in June 2016. In the future, should we decide to file for a formal five-year patent term extension of U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231 under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we would need further cooperation from Scripps to complete the submission and such cooperation is not guaranteed. Although U.S. Patent 5,912,231 supplements our existing intellectual property portfolio, we are chiefly reliant on our U.S. Patent 8,530,409, which covers the novel formulation and method of use for Locilex\u00ae and provides for substantially longer patent coverage (until June 2032) than U.S. Patent 5,912,231. Because a patent term extension is filed only after regulatory approval, we would need to consider the possibility for a patent term extension at a later date even if we are able to identify a promising new clinical indication to target for further clinical development. An inability to extend the patent past June 2017 may impair our competitive position if other companies use pexiganan as an API to develop a product that, once approved by the FDA, competes with Locilex\u00ae.\nWe may become subject to third parties\u2019 claims alleging infringement of their patents and proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate our patents or proprietary rights, or we may need to become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be costly, time consuming, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\nLitigation relating to infringement or misappropriation of patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is common. We may become subject to third-party claims in the future relating to our technologies, processes, formulations, methods, or products that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and which, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and attorney\u2019s fees, if we are found to be infringing a third party\u2019s patent rights. We may also become subject to claims that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. These risk are exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in pharmaceutical patents is, in most instances, uncertain and highly complex. We would be particularly at risk if any such claims relate to our key U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 covering our particular formulation of and method of use for Locilex\u00ae.\nFurthermore, if a patent infringement suit is brought against us relating to Locilex\u00ae (or any other products we may develop or acquire in the future), our research, development, manufacturing or sales activities relating to Locilex\u00ae or the product candidate that is the subject of the suit may be delayed or terminated. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential infringement claims, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party, which would be likely to include a requirement to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights. If we are unable to enter into a license on acceptable terms, we or our collaborators could be prevented from commercializing Locilex\u00ae (or any other products we may develop or acquire in the future), or forced to modify such product candidates, or to cease some aspect of our business operations, which could harm our business significantly.\nIn addition, competitors may infringe our patents, or misappropriate or violate our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may find it necessary to file infringement or other claims to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, in any infringement proceeding brought by us against a third party to enforce our rights, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the basis that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any such litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could open us up to additional competition and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings, and such litigation could impair our ability to raise funding for our company. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, there could be a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also require significant time and attention of management and technical staff, which may materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with any intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nAs a result of any such litigation, we may also be required to: (i) cease selling, making, importing, incorporating or using one or more or all of our products that incorporate intellectual property of others, which would adversely affect our revenue; or (ii) redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming.\nRestrictions on our patent rights relating to Locilex\u00ae may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nAssuming FDA approval, our ability to market and sell Locilex\u00ae will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for Locilex\u00ae (or any products we may develop in the future), preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The U.S. patent that we sublicense from Scripps (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231), which is directed to the composition of matter of pexiganan, expires in June 2017 without any term extension. The foreign patents corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231 expired in 2009. As a result, we have no foreign patent protection for the pexiganan API. We have recently been issued a U.S. patent, U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409, covering our new formulation of Locilex\u00ae as well as a method of using this new formulation to treat skin or wound infections. The U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 claims are directed to very specific formulations of the pexiganan API, and their methods of use to treat skin or wound infections. As a result, U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 would not prevent third party competitors from creating, making and marketing alternative formulations of pexiganan, including topical formulations, that fall outside the scope of the U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 claims. There can be no assurance that any such alternative formulations will not be equally effective as Locilex\u00ae. Introduction of any such competitive product could have a material adverse effect on sales of Locilex\u00ae. Moreover, even if these competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indication, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on Locilex\u00ae or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and furthermore, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nIf our Locilex\u00ae trademark is not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered trademark, Locilex\u00ae, may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to this trademark, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademark, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for Locilex\u00ae, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S., including in foreign jurisdictions, are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.", "PERMNO": 14538, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PLXP"}
