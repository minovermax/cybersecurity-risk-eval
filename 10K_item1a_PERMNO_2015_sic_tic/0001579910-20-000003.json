You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may require additional capital to continue operations in the future, which capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit totaled $122.5 million. During 2019 our net loss totaled $29.9 million and we used $21.9 million of cash and investments for operating activities, the purchase of property and equipment and expenditures for patents. To date we have not generated significant revenues to enable profitability. We expect to continue to incur significant losses. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.7 million. In February 2020 we completed a common stock equity offering that netted $26.3 million. In the absence of a significant revenue increase these cash resources will provide sufficient funding into early 2021. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a new business. Our continuance as a going concern is dependent on future profitability. We are actively pursuing expanding our technology portfolio, increasing our revenue opportunities by completing deliverables under current contracts and entering into new prepaid and paid up royalty arrangements, and efficiently managing operations and exploring cost saving opportunities. We may not be successful in these efforts. We may need to seek to raise additional capital from the sale of equity securities or incurrence of indebtedness. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all in which case we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe have a history of operating losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability or positive cash flows.\nWe have a limited operating history and utilize planned milestones for investors to evaluate our progress. We have generated minimal revenues and we have a history of losses from operations with an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2019 of $122.5 million. Our operations have been funded with initial capital contributions, proceeds from the sale of equity securities and debt. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to refine existing technology, develop new technology, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability and, ultimately, positive cash flows, may depend on whether we can obtain additional capital when we need it and will depend on whether we continue to refine our technology and find additional customers who will license our designs. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate meaningful revenues, or that the revenues we do generate will be sufficient to achieve profitability and positive cash flows.\nInitial shipments by our customers of filters produced from our designs may not result in high-volume sales and meaningful revenues.\nWe have had limited success in producing designs that our customers have had fabricated into filters shipped for use in mobile devices. While we believe initial shipments by customers of our designed filters represent a next step in validating our business model, initial shipments are not necessarily indicative of meaningful unit volumes or royalty revenues. Often our customers\u2019 initial filter shipments are to distributors as design kits or early stocking inventory, and high-volume sales and resulting royalty revenues may not materialize from these filters.\nOur business model is based on licensing filter designs, which is unproven. Historically, our target customers have relied on their own filter designs or purchased finished filters from a manufacturer, and have not licensed third-party designs. Consequently, we may not succeed in our licensing strategy, which would require us to adopt a new business model and would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and potentially threaten our viability.\nOur business model is based on licensing our proprietary filter designs. We do not intend to manufacture or sell any physical products or operate as a contract design company developing designs for a fee. We believe licensing our designs is the most direct and effective means of delivering our solutions to the market. We intend to retain ownership of our designs and charge royalties based on sales of filters and RFFE modules that incorporate our designs.\nOur target customers either make part or all of the RFFE. These customers have historically used their own filter designs or purchased finished filters from a manufacturer. Our business model is new to the filter industry and remains unproven, as we have yet to receive meaningful royalty payments from our licensed designs. The failure to scale our business model would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues and potentially threaten our viability.\nWe may not be able to complete some of our designs because they do not meet our customers' expectations. Even if we succeed in developing a design that meets all of a customer's requirements, the customer could decline to use our design in their products. Further, our customer's product could fail in the marketplace. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business and potentially threaten our viability.\nWe develop filter designs to meet our customers' stringent performance specifications. Our customers often ship pre-production samples of our designed filters to their customers for further evaluation. For some designs, mass production may commence. However, the filter qualification process is demanding and some designs will not result in volume production. If successfully developed and selected by our customer, our designs will compete against other technologies for inclusion in our customers\u2019 products. Our customers\u2019 final products will then compete against other products and technologies for inclusion in mobile devices in the marketplace. There can be no assurance that we can complete our designs, that our final designs will have acceptable performance and meet our customers\u2019 specifications, or if our pre-production sample filter shipments will be selected for production. Even if our filter designs have acceptable performance, there are a number of other considerations influencing the customer\u2019s decision whether to use our design, such as packaging type and manufacturing cost, many of which are beyond our control. The decision to use our designs is solely within our customers\u2019 discretion. Further, if our filter design is selected by a customer for inclusion in its design or product, there is no guarantee that the customer\u2019s design or product will be selected for inclusion in mobile devices. The failure of a significant number of our designs to be selected at the design stage or the device stage would have a material adverse effect on our business and potentially threaten our viability.\nWe are not a filter manufacturer, and thus we are reliant on filter fabricators or manufacturers to manufacture filters from our designs. For some of our customers that will not themselves manufacture filters from our designs, we may be required to have our customer approve the filter manufacturer, and the customer will not license our design unless the manufacturer can demonstrate the ability to economically produce the filter in large volumes.\nEven though some of our designs have reached commercialization on a small scale, and we believe our future completed designs can be manufactured using existing technology, we remain dependent on the manufacturer\u2019s filter fabrication processes and capabilities for our filter designs. Even with a fully compliant filter design, the customer may not license our design unless the manufacturer can demonstrate the ability to economically produce the design in large volumes. We do not have any control over the manufacturer and cannot provide assurances that the manufacturer will have the necessary technology, skills and resources to successfully manufacture filters from our designs in commercial quantities.\nOur designs are complex and may prove difficult to manufacture in commercial quantities. We will be relying on our customers and filter fabricators or manufacturers to build filters from our designs. Our business could fail if they encounter difficulties manufacturing filters in commercial quantities.\nWe develop complex filter designs, which is inherently challenging. Only a small number of our designed filters are currently in production. We rely on our customers and filter fabricators or manufacturers to manufacture our designed filters. They will need to manufacture filters in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, and we have little or no control over the manufacturing process. They must also operate and maintain sophisticated manufacturing equipment, and equipment failures can have adverse consequences on production volumes, yields and schedules. They may encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems with quality control, raw material and component supply shortages, low manufacturing yields, increased costs, shortages of qualified personnel and/or difficulties associated with compliance with regulatory requirements. Any of these problems may adversely affect the timing and amount of our future revenues. Additionally, if our customers and their suppliers encounter difficulties manufacturing filters from our designs in commercial quantities, our business could fail.\nOur business success relies on manufacturers to fabricate our designs, and market acceptance of our designs could be adversely affected if the manufacturers decline to manufacture our designs.\nWe are a filter design company and will not commercially manufacture any products. Our business model is to license our designs to customers, who will manufacture our designs themselves or rely on third party manufacturers, commonly\nreferred to as foundries, to fabricate our designs for integration into the customer\u2019s overall product. Many foundries offer potentially competitive filter technology as part of their standard product line or offer the services of in-house design teams which may consider us competition. In this case, our customers may face resistance by their foundries to manufacture our designs. We believe the economics can be structured to make it attractive to the foundries to manufacture our designs for our potential customers but we cannot be assured of the success in convincing them of the value of manufacturing our designs. The reluctance of foundries to manufacture our designs could adversely affect the market acceptance of our designs.\nWe develop and test our designs under laboratory conditions using low volume production samples. Once in production, our designs may not perform as well, or prove unreliable, due to manufacturing variations and operating conditions. This could adversely affect our business.\nWe develop and test our designs under laboratory conditions using low volume production samples. The transition from product development to commercial production requires high volume manufacturing which introduces product variations. These variations can adversely affect performance and reliability. Similarly, our designs may not perform as well or prove sufficiently reliable under actual operating conditions. This could adversely affect our business.\nWe perform failure analysis and reliability testing of our customers\u2019 parts that use our designs. If our analysis and testing prove to be faulty and our customers rely upon such information, our reputation could be damaged and our future business and revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe perform failure analysis and reliability testing of our customers\u2019 parts. In the event our analysis and testing prove to be faulty or insufficient, including due to failure of our laboratory equipment or human error, and our customers rely upon the results we provide, our reputation may be damaged, and customers may be reluctant to utilize our services or license our designs. This could harm our ability to attract customers and negatively impact our financial results, and may result in claims against us by our customers or others.\nWe have completed and continue to actively work on filter designs with, and expect to derive all of our revenues from, a small number of customers. Our failure to retain or expand customer relationships will have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nWe expect to derive our revenues from, a small number of customers. Our failure to retain or expand customer relationships, or any problems we experience in collecting receivables from them, would harm our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our industry is experiencing consolidation among suppliers and manufacturers of RF front-end components and modules, including activities of module suppliers who vertically integrate by acquiring component suppliers and fabs. This may lead to fewer customers, reduced demand for our designs and replacement of our designed products by the consolidated company. Any of these possibilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a solutions company, providing designs based on our ISN\u00ae software platform, intellectual property and design team. We license our designs to manufacturers of RFFEs, RFFE sub-systems and components for mobile devices. If our designs do not achieve widespread market acceptance among RFFE manufacturers, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nAchieving additional acceptance among RFFE manufacturers of our designs will be crucial to our continued success. We have a limited history of marketing designs and we may fail to generate significant interest in our designs. These and other factors may affect the rate and level of market acceptance, including:\n\u2022\nour royalty fees and the cost of our designed filters relative to other competing designs and technologies;\n\u2022\nperception by RF front-end manufacturers and mobile device manufacturers;\n\u2022\npress and blog coverage, social media coverage, and other publicity and public relations factors which are not within our control; and\n\u2022\nregulatory developments related to manufacturing, marketing and selling our designs.\nIf we are unable to achieve or maintain market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nOur future revenue is inherently unpredictable. As a result, as our revenues increase our operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period, and we may fail to meet the expectations of our analysts and investors, which may cause volatility in our stock price and may cause our stock price to decline.\nAs we generate revenue, we expect our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\na downturn in the markets for our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in the manufacture of our designed filters, our customers\u2019 products, or the products into which our customers\u2019 products are incorporated, or in the supply of raw materials or product components used to produce such filters or products;\n\u2022\na failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our designs;\n\u2022\ncancellations or postponements of previously placed orders for our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nincreased financing costs or any inability to obtain necessary financing;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our business of any cost reduction measures;\n\u2022\na loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business;\n\u2022\nthe impact of political uncertainties, such as government sequestration and uncertainties surrounding the federal budget, customer spending and demand for products incorporating our designs;\n\u2022\nother conditions affecting the timing of orders of our customers\u2019 products incorporating our designs;\n\u2022\nreductions in the royalty rates for our designs occasioned by a reduction in the prices for our customers\u2019 products, increases in the costs of raw materials used to produce our customers\u2019 products, or other factors;\n\u2022\neffects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of RF filters that compete with our filter designs, resulting in reduced royalty revenue;\n\u2022\nobsolescence of our designs;\n\u2022\nresearch and development expenses incurred with respect to new filter design introductions;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of new industry standards;\n\u2022\nthe loss or gain of significant customers;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new designs and manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nchanges in technology;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes;\n\u2022\ncustoms (including tariffs imposed on products, or components thereof, into which our filter designs are incorporated, or the equipment used in the production of such products), import/export, and other regulations of the countries in which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of M&A activities; and\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism or violence and international conflicts or crises, including pandemic events and the spread of disease.\nOur limited visibility into future demand for products incorporating our finished filter designs makes it difficult to forecast royalty revenue.\nOur customers have had difficulty accurately forecasting their product sales volumes and the timing of new product introductions, which ultimately affects the royalties we expect to receive for sales of products incorporating our finished filter designs. Our limited visibility into the demand for our customers\u2019 products makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast royalty revenues, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future.\nThe markets in which we compete are cyclical and any future downturn may delay or reduce the demand for our designs and resulting royalty revenue.\nHistorically, the markets in which we compete have experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, declines in consumer demand for end-user products, the maturation of product cycles and declining general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Any future downturn in the markets in which we compete, or changes in demand for our designs from our customers, could result in a significant delay in our realization of or reduction in our revenue and may also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nThe complexity of our designs could result in unforeseen delays or expenses from latent defects that could reduce the market acceptance for our designs, damage our reputation and adversely affect our future revenues and operating costs.\nWe are developing highly complex filters designs using a new approach. We have produced only a limited number of designs that have gone into commercial production and therefore cannot be certain our methods and testing procedures are adequate to detect latent design defects. If any of our designs contain latent defects, we may be unable to correct these problems. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our designs, which could harm our ability to attract customers and negatively impact our financial results. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others.\nFailures in the products or services of our customers, including those resulting from defects or errors, could result in decreased sales and harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part on the demand for mobile wireless devices and other products that incorporate our proprietary filter designs. Our customers\u2019 products are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors unrelated to our designs that are detected only when the products are in use. Any defects or errors in the products of our customers could result in product recalls or the discontinuation of those products, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results due to a delay or decrease in demand for our designs. Further, security failures, defects or errors in mobile wireless devices, such as the issues with the Galaxy Note 7 in 2016 that caused Samsung to discontinue that product, have led to increased scrutiny of component suppliers. If our customers do not perceive our designs, or if mobile device manufacturers do not perceive the products of our customers, to be of high quality, or if we or our customers are unable or unwilling to comply with heightened quality assurance requirements of mobile device manufacturers, we may be unsuccessful in having our designed filters incorporated into finished products.\nOur designs may not gain widespread acceptance unless they offer greater benefits to our customers than offered by competing RF filter designs.\nRF front-end manufacturers are primarily concerned with the cost, size and performance of RF filters. Our designs may not gain widespread acceptance unless, as compared to competing RF filter designs, they are smaller in size, can be fabricated at reduced cost or designed in less time, or improve performance. There can be no assurance that our SAW or TC-SAW filter designs will cost sufficiently less to manufacture than existing BAW filters, or can be designed in less time, to prove economically attractive to RF front-end manufacturers or that our filter designs will be smaller in size or perform better.\nOur technologies have only limited verification in practice or on a commercial scale.\nOur technologies have been subject to only limited testing on a commercial scale. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully develop designs that will transition into production or license our proposed designs on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur development cycles are long and our final designs may no longer remain competitive upon completion.\nWe operate in an industry which is subject to rapidly evolving technologies. Because our designs are expected to have long development cycles, we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands. To compete successfully, we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our designs and technologies.\nOur industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in designs, products or new solutions that are superior to our designs under development. If we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, our designs may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nWe operate in an industry which is subject to intense and increasing competition. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Rapid technological development may render our designs and technologies obsolete. Many of our competitors have or may have greater engineering, sales, marketing, operational, corporate and financial resources, and more experience in research and development than we have. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our designs or that would render our technologies and designs obsolete. We may not have or be able to raise or develop the financial resources, technical expertise, or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies.\nIf our principal end markets fail to grow or experience declines, our net revenue may not meet our business plan expectations.\nOur initial designs are being incorporated into mobile wireless devices. Accordingly, demand for our designs is dependent on the ability of mobile wireless device manufacturers to successfully sell wireless devices that incorporate our designs. We cannot be certain whether these manufacturers will be able to create or sustain demand for their wireless devices that contain our designs or how long they will remain competitive in their business, if at all. The success of these mobile wireless device manufacturers and the demand for their wireless devices can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of their mobile wireless devices that contain our designs;\n\u2022\nthe impact of slowdowns or declines in sales of mobile wireless devices in general;\n\u2022\ntheir ability to design products with features that meet the evolving tastes and preferences of consumers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency;\n\u2022\nrelationships with wireless carriers in particular markets;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of, or changes to, mobile wireless device certification standards and programs;\n\u2022\ntechnological advancements in the functionality and capabilities of mobile wireless devices;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions, tariffs, duties, or regulations by foreign governments on mobile wireless device manufacturers;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with governmental restrictions or regulations;\n\u2022\ncost and availability of components for their products; and\n\u2022\ninventory levels in the sales channels into which mobile wireless device manufacturers sell their products.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in products incorporating our technologies. We currently hold patents related to various elements of our technology and we also have patent applications currently pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other patent offices around the world. No assurances can be given that any patent will be issued on our pending patent applications or any other application that we may file in the future or that, if such patents are issued, they will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect our technology. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patents that may be issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.\nAdditionally, as we continue to expand our business in China, the application and interpretation of China\u2019s intellectual\nproperty right laws and the procedures and standards for granting trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other\nintellectual property rights in China will become more important to our business. Historically, China\u2019s protection of intellectual\nproperty rights has been less stringent and robust compared to other countries such as the United States, and consequently\nintellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other\ncountries. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use is also difficult and the measures we take to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights may not be adequate. Accordingly, infringement of our intellectual property rights poses a serious risk of doing\nbusiness in China.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology, products and services could be harmed significantly.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technologies, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors, independent contractors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Additionally, we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our technologies and trade secrets by maintaining physical and electronic security of our premises and information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Furthermore, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they bring against us, to determine ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the procedures that we have followed to prevent such disclosure are or will be adequate. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of the technology or information that we protect as trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nOur proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our intellectual property without compensating us, thereby eroding our competitive advantages and harming our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the intellectual property laws of the United States, so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be adversely affected. We rely on trademark, copyright, mask works, trade secret and patent laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary methods and technologies. We currently hold patents and have pending patent applications related to our technology solutions. Valid patents may not be issued from our pending applications, and the claims allowed on any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or offerings and services. Any patents we currently hold or that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide us with adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States, including the America Invents Act, and other countries and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of our proprietary rights in such countries may be inadequate. From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of limited resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our technology platform) we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who have not incurred the same level of expense, time and effort to create and protect their intellectual property.\nFurthermore, we acquired some of the patents we currently hold from Superconductor Technologies, Inc., or STI. Although we believe we have obtained valid assignments of patent rights from STI and STI has obtained valid assignments of patent rights from all inventors, if an inventor did not adequately assign his or her patent right to STI or STI did not adequately assign its patent rights to us, a third party could obtain a license to the patent from such inventor or STI. This could preclude us from enforcing the patent against such third party. In addition, because we acquired our patents from STI, some of the inventors of our patents are not our employees and they are not obligated to assist us in prosecuting, maintaining, defending\nand enforcing such patents. Without the cooperation of the inventors of our patents, it may be difficult for us to prevail in any legal action involving the intellectual property rights under our patents. Additionally, the inventors may have information, trade secrets and know-how learned while at STI that is not our property and if disclosed could provide competitors with insights that allow them to invent around our patented technology.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain adequate patent protection, or to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or inventing around our intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nThird parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights in proprietary technology against us for which we may be liable or have an indemnification obligation. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.\nAlthough third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, results of operations or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from licensing certain designs or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed the claimant\u2019s patents or copyrights, royalties or other fees. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unsuccessful in monetizing our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe have dedicated substantial resources to the development and protection of technology innovations essential to our business, and we expect these activities to continue for the foreseeable future. We also intend to aggressively pursue monetization avenues for our intellectual property portfolio, potentially including licensing, royalty or other revenue-producing arrangements. However, our revenues are currently generated in part by licensing our technology and we may never be successful in generating a revenue stream from our intellectual property, in which case our investments of time, capital and other resources into our intellectual property portfolio may not provide adequate, or any, returns.\nOur customer agreements include indemnity provisions and may expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur customer agreements include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify third parties for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our designs, services, or other contractual obligations. The term of these indemnity provisions generally survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe use highly specialized proprietary software as well as commercially available software pursuant to annual licenses, and the failure of this software or inability to renew any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to design new RF filters and thus our potential for generating revenues.\nWe have developed and use highly specialized proprietary computer software in our design process. The failure of any of this software to perform as expected could adversely affect our ability to produce new RF filter designs and thus our potential for generating revenues. In addition to our proprietary software, we also use highly specialized but commercially available computer software in our design process. We do not own this software and use it under the terms of licenses. These licenses are made available to us at prices and on terms generally available to any customer. If we were unable to renew any of these software licenses, we would have to locate or develop alternative software. We cannot assure you that suitable alternative software would be available on commercially reasonable terms or could be developed by us at reasonable cost. The loss of any one of these software licenses could adversely affect our ability to produce new RF filter designs and thus our potential for generating revenues.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.\nWe have only a limited operating history upon which our business and future prospects may be evaluated. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges related to recruiting, integrating and retaining qualified employees; making effective use of our limited resources; achieving market acceptance of our existing and future solutions; competing against companies with greater financial and technical resources; and developing new solutions. Our current operational infrastructure may require changes for us to scale our business efficiently with additional technical personnel and effectively to keep pace with demand for our solutions, and achieve long-term profitability. If we fail to implement these changes on a timely basis or are unable to implement them effectively, our business may suffer. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we may face in the future. As a company in a rapidly evolving industry, our business prospects depend in large part on our ability to:\n\u2022\nbuild a reputation for a superior solution and create trust and long-term relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\ndistinguish ourselves from competitors in our industry;\n\u2022\ndevelop and offer competitive technologies that meet our customers\u2019 needs as they change;\n\u2022\nrespond to evolving industry standards and government regulations that impact our business;\n\u2022\nexpand our business internationally; and\n\u2022\nattract, hire, integrate and retain qualified and motivated employees.\nIf we are unable to meet one or more of these objectives or otherwise adequately address the risks and difficulties that we face, our business may suffer, our revenue may decline and we may not be able to achieve growth or long-term profitability.\nOur management team and financial reporting group is limited in size and experience which may impact the implementation and administration of financial and reporting controls and procedures.\nAlthough our management team makes certain representations about the financial and reporting controls and procedures in our SEC filings, our management team has limited experience in implementing and maintaining our operations and our financial processes. Financial and reporting controls and procedures implemented and maintained by our management team, now or in the future, may not be adequate, with the result that there may be substantial deficiencies that will need remediation in the future. If there are inadequate controls and procedures, our financial statements and our reporting may be inaccurate or untimely.\nThe loss of the services of our key management and personnel or the failure to attract additional key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nA loss of one or more of our current officers or key employees could severely and negatively impact our operations. We have no present intention of obtaining key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers or management. Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical, managerial and other personnel is intense. As our business develops, we might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled managers and employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business may not grow, may suffer and might fail.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities, there will be additional demands on these resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including issues relating to our research and development activities and retention of experienced scientists, managers and engineers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan.\nOur worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism and epidemics that could disrupt the business of our customers or harm our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur customers are located around the world, including in the United States and Asia, and we expect that international sales will comprise a significant portion of total sales in the future. In addition, products utilizing our designs will be produced, assembled and tested at third-party manufacturing facilities located primarily in Asia. Consequently, we are subject to political, legal and economic risks associated with operations in foreign countries, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nexpropriation;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in freight and interest rates;\n\u2022\ndisruption in air transportation between the United States and overseas facilities;\n\u2022\nloss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nIn addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions, war, acts of terrorism, pandemic events and the spread of disease (including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus commonly referred to as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d), all of which are outside of our control and could disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Goleta and Burlingame operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues, safety issues, natural disasters, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health epidemics that are beyond our control.\nPublic health epidemics or widespread outbreaks of contagious diseases could adversely impact our business. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, such as the recent novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), initially limited to a region in China and now affecting the global community, could impact our operations depending on future developments, which are highly uncertain, largely beyond our control and cannot be predicted with certainty. These uncertain factors include the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease and the actions to contain or treat its impact, could adversely impact our operations, including among others, production of filters incorporating our designs in Asia, employee mobility and productiveness, temporary closure of third party facilities, and other services provided by third party service providers, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nWe have significant NOLs and R&D tax credits available to offset our future United States federal and state taxable income. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. If we experience ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, California and certain states have suspended use of NOLs for certain taxable years and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future.\nDepending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use NOLs in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws and regulations, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, operating results, and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations by federal or state authorities, may have a material adverse effect our business, cash flows, operating results or financial condition. The federal government recently enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which contains many significant changes to federal income tax laws, including a reduction to the U.S. Corporate income tax rate. The reduction in the tax rate, for 2018 and forward, impacted our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 by $6.8 million, which would have been recognized as tax expense if we did not have a full valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. Changes in corporate tax rates and the deductibility of expenses contained in the 2017 Tax Act or other tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the future value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time costs or expenses in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. In addition, foreign governments or U.S. states may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to taxation applicable to us and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our proprietary information, or other hacking attacks on our systems, could adversely affect our business.\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks, with third parties seeking unauthorized access to our proprietary information and technology. Computer malware, viruses, and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems in the future. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and in some instances we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, we may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our proprietary information and to prevent other cybersecurity breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security.\nAny failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our proprietary information could result in the loss or misuse of such proprietary information, which could harm our business and diminish our competitive position. Such attacks may also create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers and reduce demand for our products and services.\nAffected private parties or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, and operating results.\nIf we choose to acquire new businesses, products or technologies, we may experience difficulty in the identification or integration of any such acquisition, and our business may suffer.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and technologies. Accordingly, we may in the future pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves. We do not know if we will be able to identify or complete any future acquisitions, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology or retain key employees. Integrating any business, product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management. Moreover, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. If we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business will suffer. In addition, any amortization or charges resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks Relating to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could decline\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe progress, completion or failure of efforts to design our commercial products;\n\u2022\na customer decision regarding incorporation of our designs into a commercial product;\n\u2022\nthe loss of any customer relationship;\n\u2022\nthe addition of a new customer relationship;\n\u2022\nmergers and acquisitions involving us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwhether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nlockup releases, sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key employees; or\n\u2022\nan adverse impact on the company from any of the other risks cited herein.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general, experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Two putative class action lawsuits were filed in March 2015 against the Company and certain members of the Board of Directors and executives and subsequently settled. We may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future. Such litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, result in substantial costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of February 5, 2020. As a result, these stockholders will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a manner that is adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to\ncomply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees or retain professional service providers in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, we expect that these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nWe are required to evaluate and have audited our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation and audit could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting and have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. Management\u2019s report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our accounting firm issues an adverse report on how our controls are documented, designed or operating, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Item 7 - -Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to the fair values of equity instruments, other financial instruments and income taxes.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the\ntrading value of our securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise\nattempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. While we strive to maintain\nconstructive, ongoing communications with all of our stockholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of\nenhancing value for all stockholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in\nthe composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy\ncontest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and\nassociated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention\nfrom the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to\nexecute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a\nproxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may be exploited by\nour competitors, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic\ninitiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and\noperating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to\neffectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may\nbecome subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a\nfurther distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In\naddition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or\nspeculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our\nbusiness.\nA securities class action lawsuit and a shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed against us in 2015 and subsequently settled.\nLegal proceedings of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn 2015, a putative class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed against us and certain of our\ndirectors and officers, which lawsuits were settled in November 2017 and August 2018, respectively. Lawsuits of this nature\nmay divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we denied the\nmaterial allegations in the lawsuits and defended ourselves vigorously, defending the lawsuits resulted in substantial costs. In\naddition, we may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future. Such litigation could divert our management\u2019s\nattention and resources, result in substantial costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We maintain director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate to protect us from potential claims; however, we cannot assure you that it will. Further, if we are subject to future litigation, the costs of insurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, which might make it more difficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors of the Company.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur failure to comply with U.S. laws and regulations relating to the export and import of goods, technology, and software could subject us to penalties and other sanctions and restrict our ability to license and develop our filter designs.\nWe are obligated by law to comply with all U.S. laws and regulations governing the export and import of goods, technology, and services, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, regulations administered by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and regulations administered by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives governing the importation of items on the U.S. Munitions Import List. Pursuant to these regulations, we are responsible for determining the proper licensing jurisdiction and export classification of our filter designs, and obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports and imports of technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance or other defense services to or on behalf of foreign persons. We are also required to obtain export licenses, if required, before employing or otherwise utilizing foreign persons in the performance of our contracts if the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software. The violation of any of the applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.\nThese regulations could restrict our ability to license existing filter designs and develop new designs. For example, as a result of ITAR requirements, we are unable to supply certain products to China satellite companies or end users, which comprise a significant part of the overall satellite market. Changes in our designs or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our designs in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying products incorporating our designs throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of product including our designs to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our designs by, or our ability to export or license our designs to, existing or potential customers with international operations and decreased revenue. Additionally, failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the U.S. government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges, and debarment from government contracts.\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies, including rising tensions between China and the United States, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly affected by the political, economic and social climate in China, including without limitation the rising tensions in the relationships between China, surrounding Asian countries, and the United States. As a result, our customers may incur increases in costs due to changes in tariffs, import or export restrictions (or other trade barriers), or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, which could harm our business. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China, there could be additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future. Such actions in the future, as well as other changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including actions in furtherance of China\u2019s stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers, could increase the cost of doing business in China, foster the emergence of Chinese-based competitors, decrease the demand for our customers\u2019 products in China, or reduce the supply of critical materials for our customers\u2019 products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nAs a result of our international operations, we may be subject to anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. If we fail to comply with these laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, or other U.S. or foreign governmental authorities could seek civil and/or criminal sanctions, including monetary fines and penalties against us or our employees, as well as additional changes to our business practices and compliance programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nDevelopments stemming from changes in Government administrations, both foreign and domestic, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions and other changes in government trade policies, could limit our ability to license our designs, which could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in Government administration could result in changes to political, regulatory and economic laws, policies and conditions that could severely and negatively impact our business. For example, the Trump administration negotiated a new North American trade pact to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and has imposed tariffs on goods imported into the United States, including from China, which has imposed retaliatory tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in the United States. Our customers are located around the world, and we expect that international sales will comprise a substantial portion of total sales in the future. In addition, we expect that products utilizing our designs will be produced, assembled and tested at third-party manufacturing facilities located primarily in Asia. Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business. For example, imposition of tariffs on our customers\u2019 products that are imported from China to the United States could harm sales of such products, which would harm our business. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation\nChanges in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations could impede the license of our designs or otherwise harm our business.\nWireless networks can only operate in the frequency bands, or spectrum, allowed by regulators and in accordance with rules governing how the spectrum can be used. The Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, in the United States, as well as regulators in foreign countries, have broad jurisdiction over the allocation of frequency bands for wireless networks. We therefore will rely on the FCC and international regulators to provide sufficient spectrum and usage rules. For example, countries such as China, Japan or Korea heavily regulate all aspects of their wireless communication industries, and may restrict spectrum allocation or usage. If this were to occur, it would make it difficult for us to license our designs for use in mobile devices in that region.", "PERMNO": 14667, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "RESN"}
