Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following material risks facing us. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially affected.\nWe Are Challenged by Uncertainties in Obtaining and Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights\nOur main competitive strength is our technology. We are dependent on patent rights, and if the patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business would be adversely affected. Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance in the design, development, and marketing of our products.\nVanishPoint\u00ae syringes comprised 84.0% of sales in 2020. When the patents of the VanishPoint\u00ae syringes and other products expire, we may experience a significant and rapid loss of sales, and our competitive position in the marketplace may weaken if other competitors use our technology. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on profitability.\nWe do not maintain patent or trademark protection in all foreign countries, but, where possible, have taken steps to protect our patents and trademarks in those countries where we market our products or where we believe other manufacturers are most likely to attempt to replicate our technology. Our lack of patent and trademark protection in certain foreign countries heightens the risk that our designs may be copied by a competitor in those countries.\nWe Are Vulnerable to New Technologies\nBecause we have a narrow focus on particular product lines and technology (currently, predominantly retractable needle products), we are vulnerable to the development of superior competing products and to changes in technology which could eliminate or reduce the need for our products. If a superior technology is created, the demand for our products could greatly diminish.\nOur Competitors Have Greater Resources\nOur competitors have greater financial resources, larger and more established sales and marketing and distribution organizations, and greater market influence, including long-term contracts. These competitors may be able to use these resources to improve their products through research and acquisitions or develop new products, which may compete more effectively with our products. If our competitors choose to use their resources to create products superior to ours, we may be unable to sell our products and our ability to continue operations would be weakened.\nOperations May Be Affected by Foreign Trade Policy\nWe are subject to risks associated with foreign trade policy. In 2020, we used Chinese manufacturers to produce 85.2% of our products. We are currently working to expand our U.S. manufacturing facility, however.\nIn the event that we become unable to purchase such product from our Chinese manufacturers, we would need to find an alternate manufacturer for the blood collection set, IV catheter, Patient Safe\u00ae syringe, 0.5mL insulin syringe, 0.5mL autodisable syringe, and 2mL, 5mL, and 10mL syringes and we would increase domestic production for the 1mL and 3mL syringes. Even with increased domestic production, we may not be able to avoid a disruption in supply.\nTrade protection measures, including tariffs, and/or changes to import or export requirements could materially adversely impact our operations. We cannot predict the impact of potential changes to U.S. foreign trade policy. Additionally, we derive 9.8% of our revenues from international sales. International sales, particularly in emerging market countries, are further subject to a variety of regulatory, economic, and political risks as well.\nWe Are Controlled by One Shareholder\nThomas J. Shaw, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has investment or voting power over a total of 46.1% of the outstanding Common Stock as of March 12, 2021. Mr. Shaw therefore has the ability to direct our operations and financial affairs and significant influence to elect members of our Board of Directors. His interests may not always coincide with the Company\u2019s interests or the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership, for example, may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could materially adversely affect\nthe market price of our Common Stock. Mr. Shaw\u2019s rights under the Technology License Agreement, as the owner of the technology we produce, present similar conflicts of interest.\nOur Stock Has Recently Experienced Significant Price Fluctuation\nOur stock price experienced significant fluctuation during 2020 and may continue to be unpredictable. Our stock price fluctuated in 2020 from a low price in January of $1.36 per share to a high in December of $15.79 per share. As of March 12, 2021, the stock price was $13.65 per share. We expect that the overall increase is connected with our recent orders from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Technology Investment Agreement, a contract with the U.S. government described in Item 2 of this report (\u201cTIA\u201d). We do not have assurance that the TIA will translate into increased sales of our products. Additionally, the products sold to the Department of Health and Human Services will be used in connection with administering a vaccine for COVID-19. We cannot predict our sales volumes if the country slows its immunization efforts.\nChallenges from the Significant Orders\nIn 2020, the U.S. government was a significant customer representing 39.0% ($31.6 million) of our net sales. With additional 2021 deliveries under the HHS Order plus the new February 2021 contract from the U.S. government, the U.S. government will likely continue to be a materially significant customer in 2021. This presents unusual challenges to our business. Our 2021 performance under these orders will be somewhat dependent upon our timely completion of expansions to our facility and machinery, which we cannot guarantee will occur according to schedule. Moreover, in light of the government\u2019s significant volume requirements, we may not be able to maintain our usual service levels to our existing customers. However, during 2020, we not only fulfilled obligations under the government\u2019s order, but we also increased delivery volumes to existing customers.\nWe Face Inherent Product Liability Risks\nAs a manufacturer and provider of safety needle products, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims. Additionally, our success depends on the quality, reliability, and safety of our products and defects in our products could damage our reputation. If a product liability claim is made and damages are in excess of our product liability coverage, our competitive position could be weakened by the amount of money we could be required to pay to compensate those injured by our products. In the event of a recall, we have recall insurance.\nOur Business May Be Affected by Changes in the Health Care Regulatory Environment\nIn the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, reform existing reimbursement programs, and/or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely affect the demand for our products and/or put downward pressure on our prices. Future healthcare rulemaking could affect our business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nWe May Experience Losses in Our Investment Account\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market risk. As a result, the value and liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could fluctuate substantially. Likewise, our other income and expenses could vary materially depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of investments and other factors. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty could increase the risk that actual amounts realized on our investments may differ from the fair values currently assigned to them. Because 31.5% of our liquid assets are invested in the market, fluctuations in market values could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nHealth Crises Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business\nParticularly during 2020, several states and local jurisdictions imposed, and others in the future may impose, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Although our manufacturing facility has continued to operate during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic due to its status as an essential business, we continue to monitor the evolving\nsituation and cannot guarantee that the situation would be the same for any future pandemic. In the future, we may elect or be required to close temporarily which would result in a disruption in our activities and operations. Our supply chain, including transportation channels, may be impacted by any such restrictions as well. Any such disruption could impact our sales and operating results.\nWidespread health crises also negatively affect economies which could affect demand for our products. With a new contract in place for 2021 sales directly to the U.S. government, our risk is somewhat mitigated for the 2021 year. However, in the event of a resurgence of this disease or in the case of any future pandemic, there is no guarantee that revenues from syringes needed for vaccines would offset the effects to our business of a global economic decline.\nHealth systems and other healthcare providers in our markets that provide procedures that use our products have suffered financially and operationally and may not be able to return to pre-pandemic levels of operations. Travel and import restrictions may also disrupt our ability to manufacture or distribute our devices. Any import or export or other cargo restrictions related to our products or the raw materials used to manufacture our products could restrict our ability to manufacture and ship products and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur key personnel and other employees could still be affected by COVID-19 or any future pandemic, which could affect our ability to operate efficiently. In addition, the conduct of clinical trials and/or regulatory reviews of our new products may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and would be affected in any future pandemic. Our sales and marketing personnel often rely on in-person and onsite access to healthcare providers which is currently restricted as hospitals are still not operating at pre-pandemic levels.\nDisruption of Critical Information Systems or Material Breaches in the Security of Our Systems Could Harm Our Business, Customer Relations, and Financial Condition\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers and suppliers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. In addition, unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our systems to obtain our confidential or proprietary information or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties. If the unauthorized persons successfully hack into or interfere with our system, we may experience a negative impact to our business and reputation. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents, and we make ongoing improvements to our systems in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. However, we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when and if they occur. We also rely on external vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. The systems of these external vendors may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security of our own systems, and we are dependent on these third parties to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, including several years or longer. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs, and security vulnerabilities could be significant. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and harm to our business operations. Depending on the type of breach, we could also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIllegal Distribution and Sale by Third Parties of Counterfeit Versions of Our Products Could Have A Negative Impact\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result. In addition, diversion of products into other channels may result in reduced revenues.\nWe Are Subject to Various Risks Related To The PPP Loan.\nUnder our promissory note in favor of Independent Bank pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d), we will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. There can be no assurance that we will be eligible or able to take advantage of certain of the changes under the PPP Flexibility Act. The PPP Loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. While we made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the PPP of the CARES Act, the certification described above does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. In addition, the SBA has stated that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good faith belief that we satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, we are found to have been ineligible to receive the PPP Loan or in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, including the False Claims Act, we may be subject to administrative penalties and could be required to repay the PPP Loan. Our request for loan forgiveness remains subject to audit and review by governmental entities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe face risk factors common to other U.S. businesses. We could be subject to complex and costly regulation. Our business could suffer if we or our suppliers encounter manufacturing problems or disruptions to transportation channels. We could be subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S, including risks associated with global economic, regulatory, or political changes, or health crises. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 88994, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "RVP"}
