{"cik": "1528610", "company": "Polonia Bancorp Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCompliance with the formal written agreement entered into with the OCC will increase our noninterest expense and failure to comply with the agreement could result in monetary penalties and/or additional regulatory actions.\nPolonia Bank entered into a formal written agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on October 21, 2014, which was subsequently amended on November 10, 2015. See \u201cBusiness - Agreements with Regulators\u201d for further information. The requirements of the Agreement will remain in effect until the OCC suspends or terminates the Agreement. We expect that additional compliance efforts related to the Agreement will result in an elevated level of noninterest expense while we revise and/or implement the various policies, procedures and reports required by the Agreement.\nThe IMCRs imposed by the OCC require the Bank to maintain a leverage ratio (equal to Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of at least 10.00% and a total capital ratio (equal to total capital to total risk-weighted assets) of at least 15.00%. While the Bank currently exceeds these capital requirements, higher minimum capital ratios may limit the Bank\u2019s ability to grow.\nIf we fail to comply with the formal written agreement or the IMCRs, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may pursue the assessment of civil money penalties against the Bank and its officers and directors and may seek to enforce the terms of the formal written agreement through a more restrictive enforcement order such as a cease and desist order or through court proceedings.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain high. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our profits and asset value.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our borrowings. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our interest rate spread to expand or contract. Our liabilities are shorter in duration than our assets, so they will re-price faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs will rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our interest rate spread to contract - and our net interest income to decline - until the yield catches up. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. We have benefited in recent periods from a favorable interest rate environment, but we believe that this environment cannot be sustained indefinitely and interest rates would be expected to rise as the economy improves.\n- 13 -\nOur policy is to originate for retention in our portfolio fixed-rate mortgage loans with maturities of up to 30 years. At December 31, 2015, $154.8 million, or 90.6% of our total loan portfolio maturing in more than one year, consisted of fixed-rate mortgage loans. This investment in fixed-rate mortgage loans exposes us to increased levels of interest rate risk.\nOur cost of operations is high relative to our assets and our income.\nOur operating expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, professional fees, federal deposit insurance premiums and other noninterest expenses totaled $11.2 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our ratio of noninterest expense to average total assets was 3.80% and 4.16% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our efficiency ratio was 99.96% for 2015 compared to 97.81% for 2014.\nIf we conclude that the decline in value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings.\nWe review our investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary. If we conclude that the decline is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio included securities with an amortized cost of $54.3 million and an estimated fair value of $54.9 million. Changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and/or prolonged price declines may result in our concluding in future periods that the impairment of these securities is other than temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down these securities to their fair value. Any charges for other than temporary impairment would not impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity.\nA significant percentage of our assets are invested in securities which typically have a lower yield than our loan portfolio.\nOur results of operations are substantially dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. At December 31, 2015, 18.8% of our assets were invested in investment and mortgage-backed securities. These investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio. While we have recently restructured our investment portfolio to increase our investment in higher yielding securities and, depending on market conditions, intend to invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans with the goal of increasing our net interest income, we may be unable to increase the origination or purchase of loans acceptable to us.\nWe are dependent upon the services of key executives.\nThe loss of our senior executive officers could have a material adverse impact on our operations because, as a small company, we have fewer management-level personnel that have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nStrong competition within our market areas could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and at times has forced us to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. As of June 30, 2015, we held less than 1.0% of the deposits in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Competition also makes it more difficult to hire and retain experienced employees. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market areas.\n- 14 -\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.\nTo remain competitive, we must keep pace with technological change.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, our primary federal regulators, and by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of Polonia Bank rather than for holders of Polonia Bancorp common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\n- 15 -\nIn addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal regulatory agencies recently have begun to take stronger supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses as a result of the current economic crisis. The actions include the entering into of written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. Federal bank regulators recently have also been using with more frequency their ability to impose individual minimal capital requirements on banks, which requirements may be higher than those imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act or which would otherwise qualify the bank as being \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the OCC\u2019s prompt corrective action regulations. If we were to become subject to a supervisory agreement or higher individual capital requirements, such action may have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business plans, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends or engage in mergers and acquisitions and may result in restrictions in our operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nWe have implemented a risk management framework to manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies which involve management assumptions and judgment. There is no assurance that our risk management framework will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.", "PERMNO": 13699, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "3PBCP"}
