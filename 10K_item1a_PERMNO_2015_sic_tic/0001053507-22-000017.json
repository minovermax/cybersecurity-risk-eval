{"cik": "1053507", "company": "AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nA significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand.\nA significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include:\n\u2022increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or communications service providers;\n\u2022the financial condition of communications service providers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof;\n\u2022governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our customers\u2019 spectrum licenses;\n\u2022a decrease in demand for wireless or colocation services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social, political or health crises, such as the material adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and markets;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure;\n\u2022delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and\n\u2022technological changes.\nIf our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant consolidation among our customers could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other customers could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases or related payments with us. In the event a customer terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of carrier consolidation-driven churn in our Asia-Pacific property segment and churn as a result of the T-Mobile MLA in our U.S. & Canada property segment in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview.\u201d\nIn addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers, including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5G, as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the customers\u2019 networks may become redundant.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.\nA substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers. If any of these customers are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOne or more of our customers, or their parent companies, may experience financial difficulties, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn, economic difficulties (including those from the imposition of taxes, fees, regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations, and any associated penalties or interest, which may be substantial) or otherwise. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our customers through disruptions of, among other things, their ability to procure their equipment through their supply chains and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital, with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks. Such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant customers, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nDue to the long-term nature of our customer leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our customers. Many communications service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. In our international operations, many of our customers are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities.\nIn addition, many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets, such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. If our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications infrastructure and our services business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our customers. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those customers, a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those customers that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue.\nOur industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives in leasing communications infrastructure assets. Competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate.\nOur expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk.\nAs we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets, including data center facilities and related assets, in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention. Achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Additionally, temporary business closures, social distancing measures and the potential unavailability of key personnel or a significant number of our employees as a result of COVID-19 are difficult to predict, and may have a negative impact on the timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Significant acquisition-related integration\ncosts, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, integrating information technology systems, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites or other communications infrastructure assets, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, beyond additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such portfolios will exist until such time as those portfolios are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks, such as those described above, as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar local laws.\nMoreover, we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. If we are not able to meet these integration challenges, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nFor example, failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired assets from the Telxius Acquisition (the \u201cTelxius Assets\u201d) into our operations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Integrating acquired portfolios of the Telxius Assets may require significant resources, including increased attention from our management team. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid. The integration of the Telxius Assets, which includes approximately 31,000 international communications sites, into our operations continues to be a significant undertaking, and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result. Additional integration challenges include:\n\u2022transitioning all data related to the Telxius Assets, tenants and landlords to a common information technology system;\n\u2022successfully transitioning the lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes; and\n\u2022maintaining our standards, controls, procedures and policies with respect to the Telxius Assets.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge in the period the determination is made.\nOur platform expansion initiatives may not be successful, or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives.\nIn addition, as we continue to invest in partnership opportunities to support our expansion initiatives, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could present governance challenges with multiple partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that partnership or to execute buyouts of their interests.\nFailure to successfully and efficiently integrate and operate acquired data center facilities and related assets, including those acquired through the CoreSite Acquisition (the \u201cCoreSite Assets\u201d), into our operations may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nIntegrating acquired data center facilities and related assets may require significant resources, including increased attention from our management team. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid. The integration of the CoreSite Assets, which includes over 20 data centers across eight United States metro areas, into our operations will be a significant undertaking, and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result. Additional integration challenges include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022retaining existing customers at the CoreSite Assets;\n\u2022unexpected costs associated with successfully developing and expanding the CoreSite Assets;\n\u2022failure to recruit or retain key personnel;\n\u2022maintaining our standards, controls, procedures and policies with respect to the CoreSite Assets; and\n\u2022successfully marketing space on the CoreSite Assets, which will depend on a variety of factors, including (i) the demand for data center space, (ii) Internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate, (iii) the presence of\nmultiple network carriers and cloud operators in our facilities, (iv) the mix of products and services offered by us, (v) the overall mix of customers, (vi) the presence of key customers attracting business through vertical market ecosystems, (vii) each data center\u2019s operating reliability and security and (viii) our ability to effectively market and sell our services.\nAdditionally, we may fail to successfully operate the data centers we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. We must safeguard our customers\u2019 infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers and ensure our data centers remain operational at all times. Problems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage. These could result from numerous factors, including human error, equipment failure, physical, electronic and cyber security breaches, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, extreme temperatures, water damage, fiber cuts, power loss, terrorist acts, sabotage and vandalism, global pandemics or health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and failure of business partners.\nWe have service level commitment obligations to certain customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our data centers are critical to many of our customers\u2019 businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and utility providers, some of which have experienced significant system failures and outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nNew technologies or changes in our or a customer\u2019s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.\nThe development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a customer\u2019s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then customers may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our customers\u2019 network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our customers\u2019 network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a customer may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Similarly, our data center site infrastructure may become antiquated due to the development of new systems that deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, the servers and other customer equipment that we house or the development of new technology that requires levels of power and cooling density that our facilities are not designed to provide. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a customer\u2019s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nCompetition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria.\nWe may experience increased competition for the acquisition of communications infrastructure assets or contracts to build new communications infrastructure assets for customers, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our data center competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, lower operating costs, lower levels of leverage, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, greater financial, marketing and other resources, access to better networks and access to less expensive power. These advantages could allow our data center competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities and as a\nresult, we may lose existing or potential data center customers, incur costs to improve our properties or be forced to reduce our rental rates. These risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent CoreSite Acquisition and Telxius Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions;\n\u2022impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\nWe may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners\u2019 interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nFurther, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as COVID-19, inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation.\nRising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The impact of COVID-19 may increase uncertainty in the global financial markets, as well as the possibility of high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nThe agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the\nservicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets.\nThe agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower or other communications infrastructure development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\u201d and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nWe also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced plans to phase out certain LIBOR rates by June 2023. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after June 2023, and LIBOR will cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate; however, no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before June 2023 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA\u2019s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nOur business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.\nOur business, and that of our customers, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations, laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands. Existing or new regulatory policies, regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we and certain of our customers are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. Additionally, we have government customers for several of our communications sites and data centers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\nIn addition, federal, state and local governments in many of our markets have recently taken actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns, among others, and may take\nadditional actions in the future. In response to governmental actions, we have taken a variety of measures, including providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. These governmental actions could remain effective for a prolonged period of time with potential material adverse impacts on our, and our customers\u2019, business operations. Moreover, while the restrictions and limitations noted above may be relaxed or rolled back if and when COVID-19 abates or vaccinations become more prevalent, such government actions may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve and in response to actual or potential resurgences, including due to emerging variants. The scope and timing of any such reinstatement is difficult to predict and may materially and adversely affect our operations in the future.\nFurthermore, the tax laws, regulations, applicable license terms and conditions, and interpretations governing our business, and that of our customers, in jurisdictions where we operate, may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. This includes changes in tax laws, spectrum use terms, administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. For example, the definition and application of AGR in India and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Changes in laws, regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications infrastructure or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay;\n\u2022failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied;\n\u2022expropriation resulting in government takeover of customer operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture;\n\u2022laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation;\n\u2022changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications infrastructure;\n\u2022actions restricting or revoking our customers\u2019 spectrum licenses, or alterations or interpretations thereof, or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses;\n\u2022failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements;\n\u2022failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information;\n\u2022material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids;\n\u2022significant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue;\n\u2022loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and\n\u2022price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure.\nWe also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which has increased in the last few years as a result of uncertainties caused by COVID-19, can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income.\nIf we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow.\nCommencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:\n\u2022we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and\n\u2022we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT\u2019s deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nFurthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\nOur use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy.\nFurther, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments.\nIn addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.\nWe could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater\ncontaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. Further, our data center properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and ADA federal requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements.\nThe requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions, these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers\u2019 compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nOur towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage or result in increased insurance premiums.\nOur towers, fiber networks, data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as hurricanes, ice and windstorms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 or other pandemics and acts of terrorism. During the past several years, we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our customers under our contractual obligations, typically through diesel-powered generators, in emerging markets. Additional environmental liabilities, such as contamination, asbestos-containing building materials and mold or other air quality issues at some of our data centers, could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.\nIn addition, governmental initiatives to address climate change and future initiatives could, if adopted, require us and our customers to make capital expenditures to be compliant with these initiatives and increase our and our customers\u2019 costs. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could also lead to fines and/or lost revenue. We could also face a negative impact on our reputation with the public and our customers if we violate climate change laws or regulations. In October 2021, we adopted science-based targets, which were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are in line with the goals set forth in the 2015 Paris Agreement. These goals may require us to expend significant resources to meet them, which could increase our operational costs. Failing to meet these goals could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation with our key stakeholders, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations.\nFurther, any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems, as a result of measures implemented in response to COVID-19 or otherwise, may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our customers and lead to customer loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and also, our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage for certain natural disasters and business interruption, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new customers that could have been added to our towers, fiber networks or data centers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event, such was wildfire damage caused by our towers. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nIf we, or third parties on which we rely, experience technology failures, including cybersecurity incidents or the loss of personally identifiable information, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include reputational damage.\nAs part of our normal business activities, including in our data centers, we rely on energy systems, communication networks, information technology and other computing resources. We may be vulnerable to physical or cybersecurity breaches that could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We face risks\nassociated with unauthorized access to our or our vendors\u2019 computer systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our or our vendors\u2019 networks or the security of our communications infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers\u2019 operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security.\nGlobally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. As techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication, and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we, or our vendors, may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or implement security measures in a timely manner. If and when implemented, we, or our vendors, may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We offer managed services in certain of our data centers where we provide \u201csmart hands\u201d services for our customers. The access to our customers\u2019 networks and data, which is gained from these services, creates some risk that our customers\u2019 networks or data will be improperly accessed. If we were held responsible for any such breach, it could result in a significant loss to us, including damage to our customer relationships, harm to our brand and reputation and legal liability. Additionally, while we maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs in the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, and we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks.\nAlthough we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our customers\u2019 network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our customers or landlords, or customer information on our fiber, data center or managed networks businesses), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, damage to our customer and vendor relationships, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. In addition, our recent acquisitions, including our acquisitions of data centers, may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business.\nOur costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated.\nPublic perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks, including claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects, could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our customers and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.\nIf we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to\nrenew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all, though we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases expire. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, would adversely impact our operating income. We could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases. Additionally, we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers. If such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers, which could be disruptive to our business.\nIf we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated.\nOur communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers.", "PERMNO": 86111, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "AMT"}
