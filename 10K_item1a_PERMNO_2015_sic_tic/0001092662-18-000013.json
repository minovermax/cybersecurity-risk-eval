{"cik": "1092662", "company": "CHEMBIO DIAGNOSTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information provided in this Form 10-K in considering whether to make or continue to hold an investment in our Common Stock. The risks described below are those we currently believe may materially affect us. An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk, and should be considered only by persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Although we believe that these risks are the most important for you to consider, you should read this section in conjunction with our financial statements, the notes to those financial statements and our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our periodic reports and incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere are competing products that could significantly reduce our U.S. sales of rapid HIV tests.\nIn 2006 Alere, Inc. acquired a division from Abbott Diagnostic located in Japan that manufactured and marketed a rapid HIV test product line called Determine\u00ae. The Determine\u00ae format was developed for the developing world and remote settings and, central to the needs of that market. The format is essentially a test strip that is integrated into a thin foil wrapper. When opened, the underside of the wrapper serves as the test surface for applying the blood sample and performing the test. This design reduces costs and shipping weights and volumes and provides an advantage for the developing world markets it serves. Some of the disadvantages of the platform are the amount of blood sample that is needed (50 microliters versus 2.5, 5 and 10 for our lateral flow barrel, lateral flow cassette, and DPP\u00ae products respectively), the open nature of the test surface, and the absence of a true control that differentiates biological from other kinds of samples.\nThe so-called \"3rd generation\" version of this product has been marketed for many years and is the leading rapid HIV test that is used in a large majority of the national algorithms of countries funded by PEPFAR and the Global Fund, as well as many other countries in the world. That product is not FDA-approved though it is CE marked. The newest Determine\u00ae HIV version, which was developed and manufactured by Alere's subsidiary in Israel, Orgenics, is the so-called \"4th Generation\" version Determine\u00ae test. According to its claims, this product detects HIV antibodies and P24 HIV antigens. Because the P24 antigen is known to occur in HIV-positive individuals' blood samples before antibodies do, the 4th generation Determine\u00ae test is designed to detect HIV infection earlier than tests that solely rely on antibody detection. Chembio's tests, as well as all of the other currently FDA-approved rapid HIV tests, only detect antibodies. There are however laboratory tests that are FDA-approved that are \"4th generation\" tests, but they are neither rapid nor point-of-care.\nThe initial \"4th generation\" Alere Determine\u00ae rapid test product that was also CE marked and that Alere launched internationally some years ago has not been successfully commercialized to the best of our knowledge and at least certain published studies were not favorable for this product. The 4th generation product that is now FDA-approved was apparently modified as compared to the initial international version, and it may perform more satisfactorily. Alere received FDA approval of this modified product in August 2013 and CLIA waiver for it in December 2014. Alere is also aggressively pursuing development of the market for this product. Moreover there is support by a number of key opinion leaders for the public health value of such 4th generation tests, and this product represents a significant competitive threat to Chembio as well as to each of the other rapid HIV test manufacturers (OraSure and Trinity primarily).\nDuring 2011, Biolytical, Inc. of Vancouver, Canada received FDA approval and in 2012 received CLIA waiver of a flow-through rapid HIV test called \"INSTI\". The flow-through technology used in the INSTI test is older than lateral flow, and requires handling of multiple components (3 vials of solution) to perform the test in multiple steps. However, these steps can be accomplished in less than ten minutes, and the actual test results occur in only one minute after those steps are completed. Therefore sample-to-result time is shorter than any of the competitive products. The product also has good performance claims. There are settings where that reduced total test time, despite the multiple steps required, may be a distinct advantage, and we believe Biolytical has made some progress in penetrating certain public health markets.\nTherefore, even though our lateral flow products currently enjoy a substantial market share in the U.S. rapid HIV test market, and we have an additional rapid HIV test, the DPP\u00ae HIV 1/2 Assay, there a number of risks and uncertainties concerning current and anticipated developments in this market. Although we have no specific knowledge of any other new product that is a significant competitive threat to our products, or that will render our products obsolete, if we fail to maintain and enhance our competitive position or fail to introduce new products and product features, our customers may decide to use products developed by our competitors, which could result in a loss of revenues and cash flow.\nMore generally, the point-of-care diagnostics industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. As new technologies become introduced into the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, we may be required to commit considerable additional efforts, time and resources to enhance our current product portfolio or develop new products. We may not have the available time and resources to accomplish this, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which would materially harm our operating results.\nAlthough we own our DPP\u00ae patent, lateral flow technology is still a competitive platform to DPP\u00ae, and lateral flow technology has a lower cost of manufacture than DPP\u00ae products. Although the DPP\u00ae platform has shown improved sensitivity as compared with conventional lateral flow platforms in a number of studies, several factors go into the development and performance attributes of products. Therefore the ability of our products to successfully compete will depend on several other factors, including but not limited to our having a patented rapid test platform technology that differentiates DPP\u00ae from lateral flow as well as from other diagnostic platform technologies.\nWe believe that our DPP\u00ae is outside of the scope of currently issued patents in the field of lateral flow technology, thereby offering the possibility of greater freedom to operate. However there can be no assurance that our patents or our products incorporating the patent claims will not be challenged at some time in the future.\nOur Competitors May Develop and Commercialize More Effective or Successful Products, and Our Research, Development and Commercialization Efforts May Not Succeed.\nWe must regularly commit substantial resources to research and development and the commercialization of our new or enhanced products. The research and development process usually takes a long time from inception to commercial launch. During each stage of this process there is a substantial risk that we will not achieve our goals in a timely fashion, or at all, and we may have to abandon a new or enhanced product in which we have invested substantial time and money. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to our research and development activities.\nOur products require significant development and investment prior to commercialization, including testing to demonstrate the products performance capabilities, cost-effectiveness or other benefits. We must obtain regulatory approval before most products may be sold and additional development efforts on these products may be required before the products will be reviewed. However, regulatory authorities may not approve these products for commercial sale or may substantially delay or condition such approval. There may be little or no market for the product and entry into or development of new markets for our products may require an investment of substantial resources even if all applicable regulatory approvals are obtained. Furthermore, we may spend a significant amount of money on advertising or other activities and still fail to develop a market for the product. The success of our efforts may be affected by our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, whether we can obtain necessary intellectual property rights and protection and our ability to obtain reimbursement authorizations in the markets where the product will be sold. Therefore, if we fail to develop and gain commercial acceptance for our products, or if competitors develop more effective products or a greater number of successful new products, customers may decide not to purchase our products.\nOur Products May Not be Able to Compete With New Diagnostic Products or Existing Products Developed by Well-Established Competitors, Which Would Negatively Affect Our Business.\nThe diagnostic industry is focused on the testing of biological specimens in a laboratory or at the point-of-care and is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Some of our principal competitors may have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several companies produce diagnostic tests that compete directly with our testing product line, including but not limited to, OraSure Technologies, Alere and Trinity Biotech. Furthermore these and/or other companies have or may have products incorporating molecular and/or other advanced technologies that over time could directly compete with our testing product line. As new products incorporating new technologies enter the market, our products may become obsolete or a competitor's products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold.\nOur Business Prospects May be Negatively Affected if We Fail to Achieve Our Financial and Strategic Objectives.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our financial and strategic objectives, including our efforts to increase sales of our products. For example, the funds for research, clinical development and other projects have in the past come primarily from our business operations. If the sale of our products slows and we have less money available to fund research and development and clinical programs, we will have to cut certain programs. If adequate financial, personnel, equipment or other resources are not available, we may be required to delay or scale back our business. If our total revenue and gross profits do not correspondingly increase or if our technology, product, clinical and market development efforts are unsuccessful or delayed, our operations will be negatively affected. Furthermore, our failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products and develop new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur Future Revenues and Operating Results May be Negatively Affected by the Ongoing Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry.\nThere has been a significant amount of consolidation in the healthcare industry. This consolidation has increased the competition to provide goods and services to customers. In addition, group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. Due to ongoing consolidation, there could be additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nOur Continued Growth Depends on Retaining Our Current Key Employees and Attracting Additional Qualified Personnel, and We May Not Be Able to Do So.\nOur success will depend to a large extent upon the skills and experience of our executive officers, management and sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among medical products businesses, geographic considerations, our ability to offer competitive compensation, relocation packages, benefits, and/or other reasons.\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to effectively manufacture, sell and market our products to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion, or to support internal research and development programs. Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, competition for experienced scientists and other personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe have entered into employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer, John Sperzel; our Chief Financial Officer, Neil Goldman; our President of the Americas, Sharon Klugewicz; and our Chief Scientist & Technology Officer , Javan Esfandiari. Due to the specific knowledge and experience of these executives regarding the industry, technology and market, the loss of the services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The contract with Mr. Sperzel expires March 2020. The contract with Mr. Esfandiari has a term of three years ending March 2019. The contract with Ms. Klugewicz expires May 2019. The contract with Mr. Goldman expires December 2018. The Company has obtained a key man insurance policy on Mr. Esfandiari.\nWe May Not Generate the Expected Benefits of Our Acquisitions or Investments and They Could Disrupt Our Ongoing Business, Distract Our Management, Increase Our Expenses and Negatively Affect Our Business.\nAs a way for us to grow our business, we may pursue strategic acquisitions or investments. These activities, and their impact on our business, are subject to many risks, including the following: (i) the benefits expected to be derived from an acquisition or investment may not materialize and could be affected by numerous factors, such as regulatory developments, insurance reimbursement, our inexperience with new businesses or markets, general economic conditions and increased competition; (ii) we may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s personnel, assets, management, information technology systems, accounting policies and practices, products and/or technology into our business; (iii) we may not be able to accurately forecast the performance or ultimate impact of an acquired business; and (iv) an acquisition may result in the incurrence of unexpected expenses, stockholder lawsuits, the dilution of our earnings or our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership, or potential losses from undiscovered liabilities not covered by an indemnification from the seller(s) of the acquired business.\nIf these factors occur, we may be unable to achieve all or a significant part of the benefits expected from an acquisition or investment. This may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow our business or otherwise achieve our financial and strategic objectives.\nThird-Party Reimbursement Policies and Potential Cost Constraints Could Negatively Affect Our Business.\nThe list of our product end-users includes hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. If these end-users do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products from their patients\u2019 healthcare insurers or payors, the use of our products could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the net sales of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors.\nHospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers who purchase diagnostic products in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product. Due to the overall escalating cost of medical products and services, there is increased pressures on the healthcare industry, both foreign and domestic, to reduce the cost of products and services. Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the United States, available levels of reimbursement may change for our existing products or products under development. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation, and regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors, may reduce the demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nTo the Extent That We Are Unable to Collect Our Outstanding Accounts Receivable, Our Operating Results Could be Materially Harmed.\nThere may be circumstances and timing that require us to accept payment terms, including delayed payment terms, from distributors or customers, which, if not satisfied, could cause financial losses.\nWe generally accept payment terms which require us to ship product before the contract price has been paid fully, and there also are circumstances pursuant to which we may accept further delayed payment terms pursuant to which we may continue to deliver product. To the extent that these circumstances result in significant accounts receivables and those accounts receivables are not paid on a timely basis, or are not paid at all, especially if concentrated in one or two customers, we could suffer financial losses.\nThe Ongoing Changes in Healthcare Regulation Could Negatively Affect Our Revenues, Business and Financial Condition.\nThere have been several proposed changes in the United States at the federal and state level for comprehensive reforms regarding the payment for, the availability of and reimbursement for healthcare services. These proposals have ranged from fundamentally changing federal and state healthcare reimbursement programs, including providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the public under government-funded programs, to minor modifications to existing programs. One example is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Federal healthcare reform law enacted in 2010 (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d).\nHealthcare reform initiatives will continue to be proposed, and may reduce healthcare related funding in an effort. It is impossible to predict the ultimate content and timing of any healthcare reform legislation and its resulting impact on us. If significant reforms are made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, those reforms may increase our costs or otherwise negatively effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe Believe Our Success Depends In Part on the Continued Funding of and Our Ability to Participate in Large Testing Programs in the U.S. and Worldwide. Funding of These and or Similar Programs May be Reduced, Discontinued and/or We May Not be Able to Participate for Other Reasons.\nWe believe it to be in our best interests to meaningfully participate in large testing programs. Moreover many of these programs are funded by governments and other donors, and there can be no assurance that funding will not be reduced or completely discontinued. Participation in these programs also requires alignment and engagement with the many other participants in these programs, including WHO, CDC, U.S. Agency for International Development, foreign governments and their agencies, non-governmental organizations, and HIV service organizations. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to participate in these programs, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nIn December 2013 President Obama signed into law the PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act, which is the most recent reauthorization of PEPFAR. However, unlike the 2008 PEPFAR authorization, which authorized approximately $45 billion in funding, the new law does not authorize a specific dollar amount for funding.\nDeveloping Testing Guidelines Could Negatively Affect The Sales of Our Products.\nGovernment agencies may issue diagnostic testing guidelines or recommendations, which can alter the usage of our HIV testing products. New laws or guidelines, or changes to existing laws or guidelines, and the manner in which these new or changed laws and guidelines are interpreted and applied, could impact the degree to which our testing products are used. These developments could affect the frequency of testing, the number of people tested and whether the testing products are used broadly for screening large populations or in a more limited capacity. These factors could in turn affect the level of sales of our products and our results of operations.\nLegislative and Other Regulatory Changes Could Have An Effect On Our Business.\nThe current U.S. Presidential Administration has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, expressed concerns with respect to existing trade agreements, and has indicated a desire to make other regulatory changes during his administration. Changes in regulatory or economic conditions or in the laws and policies governing foreign trade, taxes, manufacturing, and development in the United States could impact our business. Economic and regulatory changes could also affect foreign currency exchange rates which, in turn, could affect our reported financial results and our competitiveness on a worldwide basis.\nDevelopments Related To The U.K.\u2019s Referendum On Membership in The E.U. Could Adversely Affect Us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or E.U. Following this \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum there has been increased political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and E.U. and this uncertainty may last for the foreseeable future. Until the terms and timing of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. are finalized, it will be difficult to predict the impact of Brexit. Our business in the U.K., the E.U. and world-wide could be negatively affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer. The decision of voters in the U.K. to exit the E.U. could cause volatility in global financial markets, such as global currency exchanges, resulting in a slow-down in economic activity in the U.K., Europe or globally, and result in significant regulatory changes and uncertainty. These events could make it more difficult or costly to sell our products, particularly in the U.K. and Europe, and negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. The Brexit referendum may also influence other countries and result in additional countries deciding to leave the E.U. This in turn could result in additional changes and uncertainty, any or all of which could negatively impact our business.\nWe Could be Exposed To Liability if We Experience Security Breaches or Other Disruptions and it Could Harm Our Reputation and Business.\nWe may be subject to cyber-attacks whereby computer hackers may attempt to access our computer systems or our third party IT service provider\u2019s systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential information. In addition, a contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures or obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving sensitive information. We will continue to evaluate and implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk and detect cyber incidents, but cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. Even though we take cyber-security measures that are continuously reviewed and updated, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable due to sophisticated attacks by hackers or breaches.\nEven the most well protected IT networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in security breaches are continually evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and, in fact, may not be detected. Any such compromise of our or our third party\u2019s IT service providers\u2019 data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information, could result in legal claims proceedings, liability under laws to protect, privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, damage our reputation and customers willingness to transact business with us, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur Ability to Efficiently Operate Our Business is Reliant on Information Technology and Any Material Failure, Inadequacy, Interruption or Security Breach of that Technology Could Harm Our Business.\nWe rely heavily on complex information technology systems across our operations and on the internet, including for management of inventory, invoices, purchase orders, shipping, interactions with our third-party logistics provider, revenue and expense accounting, consumer call support, online business, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products, respond to customer inquiries, and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and the internet.\nIf any of the foregoing systems fails to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or disruptions in the operation of the internet, could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations. Significant expenditures could be required to fix any such problem.\nIf There is an Increase in Demand for Our Products, it Could Require Us to Expend Considerable Resources or Harm Our Customer Relationships if We are Unable to Meet That Demand.\nIf there are significant or unexpected increases in the demand for our products, we may not be able to meet that demand without expending additional capital resources. This would increase our capital costs, which could negatively affect our earnings. In addition, new manufacturing equipment or facilities may require FDA approval before they can be used to manufacture our products. To the extent we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining such approvals, our ability to meet the demand for our products could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to expend the necessary capital resources or otherwise expand their capacity, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we or our suppliers are unable to develop necessary manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner. If we fail to increase production volumes in a cost effective manner or if we experience lower than anticipated yields or production problems as a result of changes that we or our suppliers make in our manufacturing processes to meet increased demand, we could experience shipment delays or interruptions and increased manufacturing costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nIf there are unexpected increases in demand for our products, we may be required to obtain additional raw materials in order to manufacture products to meet the increase in demand. However, some raw materials require significant ordering lead time and some are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. It is also possible that one or more of our suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver materials to us. Any shortfall in our supply of raw materials and components, or our inability to quickly and cost-effectively obtain alternative sources for this supply, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet increased demand for our products. This could negatively affect our total revenues or cost of sales and related profits.\nIf we are unable to meet customer demand for our products, it could also harm our relationships with our customers and impair our reputation within the industry. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nFor Our Business to Succeed in the Future, Our Current and Future Products Must Receive Market Acceptance.\nThe market acceptance and the timing of such acceptance, of our new products or technologies is necessary for our future success. To achieve market acceptance, we and/or our distributors will likely be required to undertake substantial efforts and spend significant funds to inform every one of the existence and perceived benefits of our products. We also may require government funding for the purchase of our products may be needed to help create market acceptance and expand the use of our products.\nIt may be difficult evaluate the market reaction to our products and our marketing efforts for new products may not be successful. The government funding we receive may be limited for new products. As such, there can be no assurance that any products will obtain significant market acceptance and fill the market need that is perceived to exist on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe May Not Have Sufficient Resources to Effectively Introduce and Market Our Products, Which Could Materially Harm Our Operating Results.\nIntroducing and achieving market acceptance for our rapid HIV tests and other new products will require substantial marketing efforts and will require us and/or our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors to make significant expenditures of time and money. In some instances we will be significantly or totally reliant on the marketing efforts and expenditures of our contract partners, sales agents, and/or distributors. If they do not have or commit the expertise and resources to effectively market the products that we manufacture, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nOther Providers of Diagnostic Tests and Sample Collection Products Will Likely Provide Us with Substantial Competition.\nOur competitors make similar products to ours. A number of our competitors are making investments in technologies and products, and may have a competitive advantage because of their greater financial, technical, research and other resources. Some competitors offer broader product lines and may have greater name recognition than we have. We also face competition from certain of our distributors or former customers that have created or may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. If our competitors\u2019 products take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing, our revenues, margins and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted if some of our customers internally develop or acquire their own sample collection devices and use those devices in place of our products in order to reduce costs.\nNew Developments in Health Treatments and Non-Diagnostic Products May Reduce or Eliminate the Demand For Our Products.\nThe development and commercialization of products outside of the diagnostics industry could adversely affect sales of our products. For example, the development of a safe and effective vaccine to HIV or treatments for other diseases or conditions that our products are designed to detect, could reduce or eventually eliminate the demand for our HIV or other diagnostic products and result in a loss of revenues.\nThe Sales Cycles for Our Products Can Be Lengthy, Which Can Cause Variability and Unpredictability in Our Business.\nSome of our products may require lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles, which makes it more difficult to accurately forecast revenues in a given period and may cause revenues and operating results to vary from period to period. Our products may involve sales to large public and private institutions which may require many levels of approval and may be dependent on economic or political conditions and the availability of grants or funding from government or public health agencies which can vary from period to period. There can be no assurance that purchases or funding from these agencies will occur or continue, especially if current negative economic conditions continue or intensify. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions at all or on a schedule and in an amount consistent with our objectives.\nOur Insurance May be Inadequate to Cover Our Potential Business Risks.\nWe believe that our present product liability and other insurance coverage is sufficient to cover our current estimated exposures, but we cannot be sure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of our policy limits. Although we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage in the future, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nDue to the Use of Our Products, We May Face Product Liability Claims for Injuries.\nIf any of our products, or any product which is made with the use or incorporation of any of our technologies, causes injury of any type or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or usage, we may subject to liability. We may not be successful in defending any product liability lawsuits brought against us. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in (i) decreased demand for our products; (ii) damage to our image or reputation; (iii) lost revenues; and (iv) incurrence of damages payable to plaintiffs\nLegal Proceedings May Cause Us to Suffer Monetary Damages or Incur Substantial Costs.\nIn the future we may become involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our businesses. These may include negligence claims, commercial disputes or other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. These lawsuits may result in damages, sometimes in substantial amounts, for commercial or personal injuries allegedly suffered. An adverse ruling or rulings in one or more such lawsuits could result in the termination or modification of a material contract or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Customers May Not Adopt Rapid Point-of-Care Diagnostic Testing.\nRapid point-of-care tests are beneficial because, among other things, they can be administered by healthcare providers in their own facilities or used by consumers at home without sending samples to central laboratories. But currently the majority of diagnostic tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the U.S. are provided by clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories. In some international markets, such as Europe, diagnostic testing is performed primarily by centralized laboratories. Future sales of our products will depend, in part, on our ability to expand market acceptance of rapid point-of-care testing and successfully compete against laboratory testing methods and products. However, we expect that clinical reference and other hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our rapid point-of-care products. Even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost effective, save time, or have better performance or other benefits, physicians, other healthcare providers and consumers may resist changing to rapid point-of-care tests and instead may choose to obtain diagnostic results through laboratory tests. If we fail to achieve and expand market acceptance of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests with customers, it would have a negative effect on our future sales growth.\nIf Our Products Do Not Perform Properly, It May Affect Our Revenues, Stock Price and Reputation.\nOur products may not perform as expected. For example, a defect in one of our diagnostic products or a failure by a customer to follow proper testing procedures may cause the product to report inaccurate information. Identifying the root cause of a product performance or quality issue can be difficult and time consuming.\nIf our products do not to perform in accordance with the applicable label claims or otherwise in accordance with the expectations or needs of our customers, customers may switch to a competing product or otherwise stop using our products, and our revenues could be negatively affected. If this occurs, we may be required to implement holds or product recalls and incur warranty obligations. Furthermore, the poor performance by one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our continuing ability to sell products and the price of our Common Stock.\nIf We Expand Our International Presence, It May Increase Our Risks and Expose Our Business to Regulatory, Cultural or Other Challenges.\nWe will continue to try to increase revenue derived from international sales of our products. There are several of factors that could adversely affect the performance of our business and/or cause us to incur substantially increased costs because of our international presence and sales, including: (i) uncertainty in the application of foreign laws and the interpretation of contracts with foreign parties; (ii) cultural and political differences that favor local competitors or make it difficult to effectively market, sell and gain acceptance of our products; (iii) exchange rates, currency fluctuations, tariffs and other barriers, extended payment terms and dependence on international distributors or representatives; (iv) trade protection measures, trade sanctions and import/export licensing requirements; (v) our inability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or registrations for our products; (vi) Economic conditions, political instability, the absence of available funding sources, terrorism, civil unrest, war and natural disasters in foreign countries; (vii) Reduced protection for, or enforcement of, our patents and other intellectual property rights in foreign countries; (viii) our inability to identify international distributors and negotiate acceptable terms for distribution agreements; and (ix) restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations.\nEconomic, cultural and political conditions and foreign regulatory requirements may slow or prevent the manufacture of our products in countries other than the United States. Interruption of the supply of our products could reduce revenues or cause us to incur significant additional expenses in finding an alternative source of supply. Foreign currency fluctuations and economic conditions in foreign countries could also increase the costs of manufacturing our products in foreign countries.\nFinancial Results, Economic, and Financing Risks\nThe Success of Our Business Depends On, in Addition to the Market Success of Our Products, Our Ability to Raise Additional Capital Through the Sale of Debt or Equity or Through Borrowing, and We May Not be Able to Raise Capital or Borrow Funds on Attractive Terms and/or in Amounts Necessary to Continue Our Business, or At All.\nWe were profitable for five consecutive years through 2013. Nevertheless, prior to 2009 we sustained significant operating losses since 2004, and we incurred an operating loss each year for 2014 through 2017. We estimate that our resources are sufficient to fund our needs through the end of 2018 and beyond. We have already made, and may continue to make, significant financial commitments to invest in our sales and marketing organization, regulatory approvals, research and development including new technologies, and production capacity, including expanded facilities.\nOur liquidity and cash requirements will depend on several factors. These factors include, among others, (1) the level of revenues; (2) the extent to which, if any, that revenue level improves operating cash flows; (3) our investments in research and development, facilities, marketing, regulatory approvals, and other investments we may determine to make; and (4) our investment in capital equipment and the extent to which it improves cash flow through operating efficiencies. There are no assurances that we will generate positive cash flow for 2018 or, in the alternative, be successful in raising sufficient capital to fund our needs after 2018.\nOur U.S. market sales are difficult to predict in 2018 given (i) our early June 2014 termination of the agreement with a third party for exclusive distribution of our cassette product in the U.S; and (ii) the May 31, 2016 termination of the agreement with a third party for exclusive distribution of our barrel product in the U.S. As a result of these terminations, we expect to continue to experience higher average revenue per unit, and a lower volume of U.S. sales, of the cassette and barrel products. Higher revenue per unit is anticipated because we previously sold these products to the exclusive U.S. distributor at a significantly lower price than the price at which the distributor resold these products to customers (including re-sellers and distributors) in the United States. However at this point with respect to the barrel product, this can occur only after any inventory that the exclusive U.S. distributor has accumulated is consumed, which may take several months. In addition, in marketing these products directly, we are incurring substantial costs associated with developing our sales and marketing organization and channel distribution partners.\nWe believe that underlying demand for HIV rapid testing in the United States remains strong, and that the restoration of some of the funding cutbacks from sequestration and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and of the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations will have a positive impact on the development of the market. On the other hand, it is possible that changes to healthcare law in 2017 and thereafter could change this and/or have a negative impact on the market for our products. Further, our products are well established and relied upon by a large installed base of customers over many years of use in the U.S. global market, and we believe this is a strong advantage. We also believe that our DPP\u00ae HIV 1/2 Assay, for which CLIA waiver was obtained in October 2014, for use with oral fluid or bloods samples will be able to serve new customers that were previously unavailable to us with our lateral flow blood tests. However, development of new customers with this product is costly and time-consuming.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase our revenues from domestic and/or international customers, our operating results will be materially harmed.\nAlthough We Were Profitable From 2009 Through 2013, We Incurred a Net Loss For Each Year From 2014 Through 2017 and Cannot be Certain that We Will be able to Sustain Profitability in the Future.\nFrom the inception of Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc. in 1985 through the period ended December 31, 2008, we incurred net losses. We were then profitable each year from 2009 through 2013. In 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, we made substantial expenditures for sales and marketing, regulatory submissions, product development, production and warehouse capacity, and other purposes, and we incurred a net operating loss. Our ability to re-achieve profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to increase sales of our products based on having made the aforementioned expenditures to reduce production and other costs, and to successfully introduce new products and enhanced versions of our existing products into the marketplace. If we are unable to increase our revenues at a rate that is sufficient to achieve profitability, or adequately control and reduce our operating costs, our operating results would be materially harmed.\nWe Base Our Estimates or Judgments Relating to Critical Accounting Policies on Assumptions That Can Change or Prove to be Incorrect.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on such statements. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to (i) revenue recognition; (ii) stock-based compensation; (iii) allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable; (iv) customer sales returns and allowances; (v) contingencies; and (vi) income taxes.\nOur estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, as set forth in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions. If our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the price of our Common Stock may decline.\nWe May Fail to Meet Our Financial Projections and There May be Fluctuations in Our Financial Results.\nFrom quarter to quarter and year to year, our operating results can fluctuate, which could cause our growth or financial performance to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Our financial projections are based on a number of assumptions, including the estimated demand for our products. However, sales to our distributors and other customers may not meet expectations because of lower than expected customer demand or other factors, including continued economic volatility and disruption, reduced governmental funding, and other circumstances described elsewhere in this Form 10-K. A variety of factors could also contribute to the variability of our financial results, including infrequent, unusual or unexpected changes in revenues or costs.\nDifferent products provide dissimilar contributions to our gross product margin. Accordingly, our operating results could also fluctuate and be negatively affected by the mix of products sold and the relative prices and gross product margin contribution of those products. Failure to achieve operating results consistent with the expectations of investors and securities analysts could adversely affect our reputation and the price of our Common Stock.\nOur Operating Results May be Negatively Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.\nIn the past our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material. Nevertheless, sales of our products are subject to currency risks, since changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive. The fluctuations in the exchange rate could negatively impact international sales of our products, as could changes in the general economic conditions.\nThe revenues and expenses of Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia, one of our subsidiaries, are recorded in Malaysian Ringgit. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. Our expectation is that the Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia business will continue to grow and, consequently, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates may grow as well.\nChembio Diagnostics Malaysia\u2019s revenues and expenses and the translation of Chembio Diagnostics Malaysia\u2019s financial results into U.S. Dollars may be negatively affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate. Favorable movement in exchange rates have benefited us in prior periods. However, where there are unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, our consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected. Furthermore, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect year-to-year comparability of operating results. In the past, we have not generally entered into hedging instruments to manage our currency exchange rate risk, but we may need to do so in the future. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully hedge against unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted.\nEconomic Volatility Around the World Could Adversely Affect Our Results.\nVolatility in the economy may continue or exist in the future. This could negatively impact our financial performance or those of our customers and suppliers. These circumstances could inhibit our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business. Many of our customers rely on public funding provided by federal, state and local governments, and this funding has been and may continue to be reduced or deferred as a result of economic conditions. These circumstances may adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment, raw materials or components. Even with the improvement of economic conditions, it may take time for our customers and suppliers to establish new budgets and return to normal purchasing and shipping patterns. We cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of an economic recovery.\nThe New U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and Any Subsequent Tax Law Changes Could Adversely Affect Us.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA includes, among other matters, changes to U.S. federal tax rates, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. We do not expect tax reform to have a material impact to our projection of minimal cash taxes or to our net operating losses. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate of 21 percent, and the impact will be recognized in our tax expense in the year of enactment. We continue to evaluate the TCJA may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is uncertain and could be adverse. In addition, subsequent unforeseen changes in U.S. or other countries\u2019 tax laws could adversely affect us. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to the TCJA and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nWe May Require Additional Capital in the Future.\nOur liquidity and ability to meet capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities; (ii) the extent to which we gain or expand market acceptance for existing, new or enhanced products; (iii) the timing and success of the commercial launch of new products; (iv) the success of our research and product development efforts; (v) changes in existing and potential relationships with distributors and other business partners; (vi) the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, proprietary rights and necessary licenses; and (vii) Competing technological and market developments.\nIf we require new financing, we may seek to raise funds by selling equity or other securities or through bank borrowings. There can be no assurance that financing through the sale of securities, bank borrowings or otherwise will be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur Business May be Negatively Affected by Terrorist Attacks or Natural Disasters.\nTerrorist attacks or natural disasters could cause economic instability. These events could negatively affect economic conditions both within and outside the United States and harm demand for our products. The operations of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted and eliminate, reduce or delay our customers\u2019 ability to purchase and use our products and our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide raw materials and finished products.\nOur facilities, including some pieces of manufacturing equipment and our computer systems, may be difficult to replace. Various types of disasters, including fires, earthquakes, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our facilities and computer systems. In the event our existing facilities or computer systems are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may have difficulty operating our business and may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or shut down entirely, it would seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur Success Depends on Our Ability to Protect Our Proprietary Technology. We Rely on Trade Secret Laws and Agreements With Our Key Employees and Other Third Parties to Protect Our Proprietary Rights, and We Cannot be Sure That These Laws or Agreements Adequately Protect Our Rights.\nOur industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection, as well as other intellectual property rights, for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio or obtain licenses to patents and technologies, both in the United States and in other countries. If we cannot continue to develop, obtain and protect intellectual property rights, our revenues and gross profits could be adversely affected. Moreover, our current and future licenses or other rights to patents and other technologies may not be adequate for the operation of our business.\nAs appropriate, we intend to file patent applications and obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology. These patent applications and patents will cover, as applicable, compositions of matter for our products, methods of making those products, methods of using those products and apparatuses relating to the use or manufacture of those products. However, there have been changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may impact our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in 2011, the U.S. enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAIA\u201d), including changes that would transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nWe believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, strategic relationships, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and name recognition are essential to our success. All our management personnel are bound by non-disclosure agreements. If personnel leave our employment, in some cases we would be required to protect our intellectual property rights pursuant to common law theories which may be less protective than provisions of employment, non-competition or non-disclosure agreements.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary products under trade secret and copyright laws, enter into license agreements for various materials and methods employed in our products, and enter into strategic relationships for distribution of the products. These strategies afford only limited protection. We currently have some foreign patents issued, and we are seeking additional patent protection in several other foreign jurisdictions for our DPP\u00ae technology. We have licenses to reagents (antigens and peptides) used in several of our products and products under development. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary assets, and respect the intellectual property rights of others, we participate in several markets where intellectual property rights protections are of little or no value. This can place our products and our company at a competitive disadvantage.\nMoreover, issued patents remain in effect for a fixed period and after expiration will not provide protection of the inventions they cover. Once our patents expire, we may be faced with increased competition, which could reduce our revenues. We may also not be able to successfully protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know-how.\nTo facilitate development and commercialization of a proprietary technology base, we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties. Obtaining and maintaining these licenses, which may not be available, may require the payment of up-front fees and royalties. In addition, if we are unable to obtain these types of licenses, our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed or precluded.\nIf We Become Involved in Intellectual Property Disputes, Such Disputes Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Eliminate Our Ability to Sell Products or Use Certain Technologies.\nWe may be required to expend substantial resources in asserting or protecting our intellectual property rights, or in defending suits related to intellectual property rights. We may seek to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights through litigation. Such litigation is prevalent and is expected to continue. In our business, there are a large number of patents and patent applications similar to our products, and additional patents may be issued to third parties relating to our product areas. We, our customers or our suppliers may be sued for infringement of patents or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights with respect to one or more of our products. We may also have disputes with parties that license patents to us if we believe the license is no longer needed for our products or the licensed patents are no longer valid or enforceable.\nThere are a large number of patents in our industry, and the claims of these patents appear to overlap in many cases. Therefore there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing that cover technologies we incorporate in our products. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. In addition, governmental agencies could commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees or us relating to claims of misuse or misappropriation of another party\u2019s proprietary rights.\nIf we are involved in litigation or other legal proceedings with respect to patents or other intellectual property and proprietary technology, it could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, market share and business because (i) it could consume a substantial portion of managerial and financial resources; (ii) its outcome would be uncertain and a court may find that our patents are invalid or unenforceable in response to claims by another party or that the third-party patent claims are valid and infringed by our products; (iii) the pendency of any litigation may in and of itself cause our distributors and customers to reduce or terminate purchases of our products; (iv) a court could award a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, which would prevent us from selling our current or future products; and (v) an adverse outcome could subject us to the loss of the protection of our patents or to liability in the form of past royalty payments, penalties, reimbursement of litigation costs and legal fees, special and punitive damages, or future royalty payments, any of which could significantly affect our future earnings.\nUnder certain contracts with third parties, we may indemnify the other party if our products or activities have actually or allegedly infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party\u2019s proprietary rights. Furthermore, our products may contain technology provided to us by third parties, and we may be unable to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. These other parties may also not be required or financially able to indemnify us in the event that an infringement or misappropriation claim is asserted against us.\nThere may also be other types of disputes that we become involved in regarding intellectual property rights, including state, federal or foreign court litigation, and patent interference, patent reissue, patent reexamination, or trademark opposition proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Opposition or revocation proceedings could be instituted in a foreign patent office as well. These proceedings permit certain persons to challenge the validity of a patent on the grounds that it was known from the prior art. The filing of such proceedings, or the issuance of an adverse decision in such proceedings, could result in the loss of valuable patent rights that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Third Party Collaborators\nOur Use of Third-Party Suppliers, Some of Which May Constitute Our Sole Supply Source, for Certain Important Product Components Presents a Risk That Could Have Negative Consequences for Our Business.\nA number of our components and critical raw materials are provided by third-party suppliers, some of which may be sole-source suppliers, which impacts our ability to manufacture or sell certain products if our suppliers cannot or will not deliver those materials in a timely fashion, or at all, due to an interruption in their supply, quality or technical issues, or any other reason. If this occurs, we could incur substantial expense and time to be able to reestablish the appropriate quality, cost, regulatory and market-acceptance circumstances needed for commercial success. Even with the needed expense and time, we may not be able to reestablish any or all of these factors. The absence of any one or more of these factors could prevent us from being able to commercially produce and market the affected product or products.\nIf Needed, We May Work with Strategic Collaborators to Assist in Developing and Commercializing Our Products.\nSome business opportunities that require a technology controlled by a third party, a significant level of investment for development and commercialization or a distribution network beyond our existing sales force may necessitate involving one or more strategic collaborators. As part of our strategy for development and commercialization of our products, we may enter into arrangements with distributors or other third-parties. Relying on such collaborative relationships could be risky to our business for a number of reasons, including: (i) we may be required to transfer material rights to such strategic collaborators, licensees and others; (ii) our collaborators may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (iii) our collaborators may decide to terminate our collaborative arrangement or become insolvent; (iv) our collaborators may develop technologies or components competitive with our products; (v) disagreements with collaborators could result in the termination of the relationship or litigation; and (vi) we may not be able to agree to future collaborative arrangements, or renewals of existing collaborative agreements, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe expect our collaborators will have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities under our agreements, there is no assurance that they will do so. Due to our reliance on strategic agreements, it can make it difficult to accurately forecast our future revenues and operating results.\nIf We Fail to Maintain Existing Distribution Channels, or Develop New Distribution Channels, It May Result in Lower Revenues.\nWe collaborate with laboratories, diagnostic companies and distributors in order to sell our products. The sale of our products depends in large part on our ability to sell products to these customers and on the marketing and distribution abilities of the companies with which we collaborate and work with.\nBy relying on distributors or third-parties to market and sell our products could negatively impact our business for various reasons, including: (i) we may not be able to find suitable distributors for our products on satisfactory terms, or at all; (ii) agreements with distributors may prematurely terminate or may result in litigation between the parties; (iii) our distributors or other customers may not fulfill their contractual obligations and distribute our products in the manner or at the levels we expect; (iv) our distributors may prioritize their own private label products that compete with our products; (v) Our existing distributor relationships or contracts may preclude or limit us from entering into arrangements with other distributors; and (vi) we may not be able to negotiate new or renew existing distribution agreements on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will try to maintain and expand our business with distributors and customers and make every effort to require that they fulfill their contractual obligations, but there can be no assurance that such companies will do so or that new distribution channels will be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to do so, our business will be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nBecause We May Not Be Able to Obtain or Maintain the Necessary Regulatory Approvals for Some of Our Products, We May Not Generate Revenues in the Amounts We Expect, or in the Amounts Necessary to Continue Our Business. Our Existing Products as well as Our Manufacturing Facility Must Meet Quality Standards and are Subject to Inspection by a Number of Domestic Regulatory and Other Governmental and Non-Governmental Agencies.\nAll of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of, and uses for, a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human or animal clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for that product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may determine to devote our resources to different products.\nChanges in government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nWe can manufacture and sell our products only if we comply with regulations and quality standards established by government agencies such as the FDA and the USDA as well as by non-governmental organizations such as the ISO and WHO. We have implemented a quality control system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Although FDA approval is not required for the export of our products, there are export regulations promulgated by the FDA that specifically relate to the export of our products that require compliance with FDA quality system regulation (\"QSRs\") and that also require meeting certain documentary requirements regarding the approval of the product in export markets.\nIf We Do Not Comply With FDA or Other Regulatory Requirements, We May Be Required to Suspend Production or Sale of Our Products or Institute a Recall Which Could Result in Higher Costs and a Loss of Revenues.\nFDA Regulations and regulations by other federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies has an effect on many aspects of our operations, and the operations of our suppliers and distributors, including packaging, labeling, manufacturing, adverse event reporting, recalls, distribution, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other agencies to determine compliance with QSRs and FDA regulatory requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, including but not limited to ISO standards. We believe that our facilities and procedures are in material compliance with the FDA requirements and ISO standards, but the regulations may be unclear and are subject to change, and we cannot be sure that the FDA or other regulators will agree with our compliance with these requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved or cleared products or impose conditions on any product clearances or approvals that could restrict the distribution or commercial applications of those products. Regulatory agencies may impose restrictions on our or our distributors\u2019 advertising and promotional activities or preclude these activities altogether if a noncompliance is believed to exist. In addition, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or additional regulatory actions, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nOur inability to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDA can result in, among other things, 483 notices, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, recall or seizure of products, civil penalties, withdrawal of product registrations, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance or PMA approval for devices, marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. The ability of our suppliers to supply critical components or materials and of our distributors to sell our products could also be adversely affected if their operations are determined to be out of compliance. Such actions by the FDA and other regulatory bodies could adversely affect our revenues, costs and results of operations.\nWe must frequently make judgment decisions with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If regulators subsequently disagree with how we have sought to comply with these regulations, we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as product recall, seizure or injunction with respect to the sale of our products. Our reputation could be substantially impaired if we are assessed any civil and criminal penalties and limit our ability to manufacture and market our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDemand For Our Products May be Affected by FDA Regulation of Laboratory-Developed Tests and Genetic Testing.\nRegulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories is covered by the FDA. The FDA has previously taken the position that it has regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, but has exercised enforcement discretion by not regulating most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. LDTs are tests designed, developed, and performed in-house by a laboratory. These laboratories are subject to CLIA regulation but such laboratories have previously not been subject to regulation by FDA under the agency\u2019s medical device requirements.\nHowever, the FDA has announced that it would begin regulating LDTs, and in October 2014 the FDA issued proposed guidance on the regulation of LDTs for public comment. But, on November 18, 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize the proposed guidance prior to the end of the Obama administration. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper synthesizing public comments on the 2014 draft guidance documents and outlining a possible approach to regulation of LDTs. The discussion paper has no legal status and does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents. We cannot predict what policies the Trump administration will adopt with respect to LDTs. If the FDA increases regulation of LDTs, it could make it more difficult for laboratories and other customers to continue offering LDTs that involve genetic or molecular testing. This, in turn, could reduce demand for our products and adversely impact our revenues.\nIn Addition to FDA Requirements, We Are Subject to Several Government Regulations, the Compliance With Which Could Increase Our Costs and Affect Our Operations.\nIn addition to the FDA regulations previously described, laws and regulations in some states may restrict our ability to sell products in those states.\nWe must comply with numerous laws related to safe working conditions, environmental protection, disposal of hazardous substances, fire hazard control, manufacturing practices and labor or employment practices. Compliance with these laws or any new or changed laws regulating our business could result in substantial costs. Due to the number of laws and regulations governing our industry, and the actions of a number of government agencies that could affect our operations, it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and impact of these laws and regulations. To the extent the costs and procedures associated with complying with these laws and requirements are substantial or it is determined that we do not comply, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe May Incur Additional Costs If We Do Not Comply With Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Regulations.\nWe believe we are not a covered entity nor a business associate of a covered entity and the Company is not responsible for complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). Even though the Company is likely not a covered entity under HIPAA, the Company does have in place administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information.] The Company is required to comply with varying state privacy, security and breach reporting laws. If we fail to comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to properly transferring data containing consumers\u2019 personal information, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. Also, there are other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of consumers\u2019 personal information, and we may be subject to enforcement by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. We could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information.\nIf We Are Not Able to Manufacture Products in Accordance With Applicable Requirements, It Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nOur products must meet detailed specifications, performance standards and quality requirements. As a result, our products and the materials used in their manufacture or assembly undergo regular inspections and quality testing. Factors such as defective materials or processes, mechanical failures, human errors, environmental conditions, changes in materials or production methods, and other events or conditions could cause our products or the materials used to produce or assemble our products to fail inspections and quality testing or otherwise not perform in accordance with our label claims or the expectations of our customers.\nIf we are not able to meet the applicable specifications, performance standards, quality requirements or customer expectations could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products or comply with regulatory requirements. These events could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nHealthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThere are various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that the Company is subject to, including anti-kickback laws, laws constraining the sales, false claims laws, marketing and promotion of medical devices by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that manufacturers of these products may enter into with physicians, hospitals, laboratories and other potential purchasers of medical devices. There are other laws the Company is subject to that require the Company to report certain transactions between it and healthcare professionals. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Many of the existing requirements are new and have not been definitively interpreted by state authorities or courts, and available guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, unless and until we are in full compliance with these laws, all of which could materially harm the Company. Furthermore, changes in or evolving interpretations of these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to change our business practices or subject our business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Compliance With Regulations Governing Public Companies is Complex and Expensive.\nPublic companies are subject to various laws and regulations, which have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. For example, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market, and the SEC\u2019s requirements for public companies to provide financial statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (\u201cXBRL\u201d). The implementation of certain aspects of these laws and regulations has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight and may require us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs. We continually review changes with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs, and the timing of such costs, we may incur. There are several interpretations of these laws and regulations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, but if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, legal proceedings may be initiated against us, which may adversely affect our business.\nAlthough We Have an Ethics and Anti-Corruption Policy in Place, and Have No Knowledge or Reason to Know of Any Practices by Our Employees, Agents or Distributors That Could be Construed as in Violation of Such Policies, Our Business Includes Sales of Products to Countries Where There is or may be Widespread Corruption.\nWe have a policy in place prohibiting our employees, distributors and agents from engaging in corrupt business practices, including activities prohibited by the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). Nevertheless, because we work through independent sales agents and distributors outside the United States, we do not have control over the day-to-day activities of such independent agents and distributors. In addition, in the donor-funded markets in Africa where we sell our products, there is significant oversight from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and advisory committees comprised of technical experts concerning the development and establishment of national testing protocols. This is a process that includes an overall assessment of a product which includes extensive product performance evaluations including five active collaborations and manufacturer's quality systems, as well as price and delivery. In Brazil, where we have had a total of six product collaborations with FIOCRUZ, the programs through which our products may be deployed are all funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Although FIOCRUZ is affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and is its sole customer, FIOCRUZ is not the exclusive supplier for the Ministry of Health. However, because each of our previous collaborations with FIOCRUZ incorporates a technology transfer aspect, we believe we have a competitive advantage versus other suppliers to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, assuming other aspects of our product offering through FIOCRUZ are otherwise competitive in comparison. We have no knowledge or reason to know of any activities by our employees, distributors or sales agents of any actions which could be in violation of the FCPA, although there can be no assurance of this.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock continues to be illiquid, so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing market prices.\nThe average daily trading volume of our Common Stock on the NASDAQ market was approximately 16,368 shares per day over the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared with approximately 19,300 shares per day over the three months ended December 31, 2016. The liquidity of our stock depends on several factors, including but not limited to the financial results of the Company and overall market conditions, so it is not possible to predict whether this level of liquidity will continue, be sustained, or decrease.\nDecreased trading volume in our stock would make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Our management and larger stockholders exercise significant control over the Company.\nThe Price of Our Common Stock Could Continue to be Volatile.\nThe price of our Common Stock has been volatile and may be volatile in the future. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market for our Common Stock: (i) the performance of our business; (ii) clinical results with respect to our products or those of our competitors; (iii) the gain or loss of significant contracts and availability of funding for the purchase of our products; (iv) actions undertaken by the Congress or the Presidential Administration; (v) changes in our relations with our key customers, distributors or suppliers; (vi) developments in patent or other proprietary rights; (vii) litigation or threatened litigation; (viii) general market and economic conditions; (ix) the relatively low trading volume for our Common Stock; (x) changes in competition; (xi) Complaints or concerns about the performance or safety of our products and publicity about those issues, including publicity expressed through social media or otherwise over the internet; (xii) failure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts and comments or opinions about us by securities analysts or major stockholders; (xiii) announcement of regulatory or enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies against us, our products or our customers; (xiv) changes in our operating results; and (xv) terrorist attacks, civil unrest, war and national disasters.\nOverall, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our Common Stock, as well as the stock of many other similar companies. Such price fluctuations are generally unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected.\nAfter the volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and the attention and resources of our management could be diverted, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nSales of Our Common Stock by Existing Stockholders, Executive Officers or Directors Could Depress the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\nIf our existing stockholders, officers or directors sell our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, it could negatively affect the price of our Common Stock. We are unable to estimate the number of shares of our Common Stock that may actually be resold in the public market since this will depend on the market price for our Common Stock, the individual circumstances of the sellers and other factors.\nInstitutional stockholders own significant amounts of our Common Stock. If one or more of these stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time, the prevailing price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that one or more of our executive officers or non-employee members of our Board of Directors could sell shares of our Common Stock during an open trading window. These transactions and the perceived reasons for these transactions could have a negative effect on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nWe Do Not Intend to Pay Cash Dividends on Our Common Stock, Therefore an Investor in Our Common Stock Will Benefit Only if the Value of Our Common Stock Increases.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock and currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Therefore, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon any future increase in value of our Common Stock. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will gain value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares.\nIf We and/or Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Conclude That Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is Not Effective, Investor Confidence and the Value of Our Common Stock May be Adversely Impacted.\nThe SEC has adopted rules requiring us, as a public company, to include a report in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of these internal controls.\nWe believe our internal controls will continue to evolve as our business develops. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting in an effort to ensure compliance with SEC rules and regulations, any control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the overall quality of our internal controls may be affected by the internal control over financial reporting implemented by any business we acquire and our ability to assess and successfully integrate the internal controls of any such business.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, implemented, or tested, or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then it may issue a report noting such dissatisfaction. We also could conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. These events could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace, which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock.\nAny Future Issuances of Shares of Our Common Stock by Us Could Harm the Price of Our Common Stock and Our Ability to Raise Funds in New Equity Offerings.\nAny future sales of a substantial number of our shares of Common Stock or other equity-related securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities.\nOur Stockholder Rights Agreement Could Make a Third-Party Acquisition of Us Difficult.\nOur Stockholder Rights Agreement, which is described above under \"BUSINESS: Stockholder Rights Agreement\" contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur Management and Larger Stockholders Exercise Significant Control Over the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our named executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders beneficially owned approximately 44.35% of our voting power, which includes four large investors that beneficially own approximately 13.97%, 10.42%, 7.46%, and 7.09%, respectively of the outstanding stock. For the foreseeable future, and assuming these ownership percentages continue to apply, to the extent that these parties vote similarly, they may be able to exercise significant control over many matters requiring approval by the board of directors or our stockholders. As a result, they may be able to:\n\u00b7\ncontrol the composition of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\ncontrol our management and policies;\n\u00b7\ndetermine the outcome of significant corporate transactions, including changes in control that may be beneficial to stockholders; and,\n\u00b7\nact in each of their own interests, which may conflict with or differ from the interests of each other or the interests of the other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 13453, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CEMI"}
