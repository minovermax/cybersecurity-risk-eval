RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The statements contained in or incorporated herein that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISK FACTORS SUMMARY\nThis risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business, but does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized below, and other risks that we face, may be found immediately following this summary.\n\u00b7\nWe have incurred net losses and have never generated revenue since inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u00b7\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\n\u00b7\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or stay in business without additional funding.\n\u00b7\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us and investigations we are subject to, and adverse results may harm our business.\n\u00b7\nWe have been named as a defendant in a putative shareholder class action lawsuits and are subject to an SEC Investigation which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation.\n\u00b7\nThe macro-economic environment in the United States and abroad has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our ability to raise capital, which may potentially impact our ability to continue our operations.\n\u00b7\nOur technology may not be successful in developing commercial products and if we are unable to successfully scale our manufacturing processes, we may not meet customer demand.\n\u00b7\nWe face business risks due to our relationships with strategic partners.\n\u00b7\nDecreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and know-how or protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology or obtain or maintain trade secret protection may affect our competitiveness.\n\u00b7\nDisruption at, damage to or destruction of our Terrebonne Facility could impede our ability to continue innovating and refining our technological process, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u00b7\nThe plastics manufacturing industry is extremely price-competitive because of the commodity-like nature of virgin PET resin and its correlation to the price of crude oil. If our cost to manufacture recycled PET is not competitive with virgin PET or if the price of oil reduces significantly, it may adversely impact our ability to penetrate the market or be profitable.\n\u00b7\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials.\n\u00b7\nThe loss of the services of Mr. Daniel Solomita, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our business.\n\u00b7\nOur Terrebonne Facility and other planned facilities must operate under policies, procedures, and controls for the operation of a chemical manufacturing facility as required under various federal, provincial and local regulations and codes. Failure to comply with such regulations and codes may lead to disruption of operations at the Terrebonne Facility and the development of our technology, and financial sanctions.\n\u00b7\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common stock.\n\u00b7\nWe are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations and failure to secure and maintain permits could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nRaising additional funds may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\n\u00b7\nTrading volume in our stock can fluctuate and an active trading market for our common stock may not be available on a consistent basis to provide stockholders with adequate liquidity. Our stock price may be volatile, and our stockholders could incur significant investment losses.\n\u00b7\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Daniel Solomita, beneficially owns a majority of the total voting power of our capital stock, and accordingly, has control over stockholder matters, our business and management.\n\u00b7\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of our company.\n\u00b7\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY\nWe have incurred net losses since inception. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have never generated material revenue and may never be profitable.\nSince our inception in 2010, we have incurred net losses. Our net loss for the year ended February 28, 2022 was $44.92 million and we have earned no revenues to date. We have financed our operations primarily through sales of common stock and incurrence of debt and have devoted substantial efforts to research and development, as well as building our team. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Although we believe that our business plan has significant profit potential, we may not attain profitable operations and management may not succeed in realizing our business objectives. Our ability to generate revenue depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our technology and products, obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our products, attract additional customers, finance, build and operate commercial facilities. We expect to incur operating losses in future periods. These losses will occur as we do not have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with our business operations. We may not generate revenues from product sales for the next several years, if ever. If we are not able to develop our business as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues in the future. If we are unable to generate revenues, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur business was started in October 2014 with the incorporation of Loop Holdings, Inc. and 8198381 Canada Inc., and the acquisition of our GEN I technology in October 2014. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and developing our technology and our Terrebonne Facility. We have not yet demonstrated the ability to manufacture a commercial-scale product or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company that is also capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nThere is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will almost certainly fail.\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or stay in business without additional funding.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our business and generate future revenues depends on whether we can obtain the financing necessary to implement our business plan. We will require additional financing through a combination of the issuance of debt, equity, and/or joint ventures and/or government incentive programs in order to establish profitable operations, and such financing may not be forthcoming. We are pursuing financial incentives and financing for our proposed projects with various countries through various programs that involve federal, provincial, state and local governments. If we are unable to attract government incentives and financing to our projects or investors to invest in our business, we may not be able to acquire additional financing through debt or equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms favorable to us. Our failure to secure additional financing on favorable terms when it becomes required would have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business plan or remain in business.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been the source of disrupted business operations for us and our customers, suppliers, vendors and other parties with whom we do business, and such disruptions could continue into the future as a result of the ongoing pandemic. In an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, governments and municipalities around the world instituted restrictive measures, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, mandated business closures and social distancing. The pandemic and resulting governmental restrictions and regulations adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets globally.\nThese measures have had and may continue to have negative effects on critical development and commercialization efforts. For example, the situation globally and the continued travel restrictions between Canada and the United States have caused disruptions in our timetable of our joint venture with Indorama in the development of our Spartanburg facility and commercialization of our technology. We cannot determine whether there will be further delays in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and further delays on the development and commercialization of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, we may experience further restrictions on the movement of employees, disruption of supply chains, shipping of raw materials, restrictions on manufacturing and decline in value of assets held by us, including property and equipment. Additionally, our management team has, and may continue, to spend time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce.\nAlthough we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact, makes it difficult to accurately forecast any effects on our results of operations for 2022 and beyond.\nCOVID-19 and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus may affect our capacity to continue our development efforts according to our schedule. Further, there may be logistics issues, operations impacts, and transportation disruptions that may cause further delays or increase costs.\nThe macroeconomic environment in the United States and abroad has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our ability to raise capital, which may potentially impact our ability to continue our operations.\nWe have and, prior to commercialization, will continue to rely on raising funds from investors and/or other sources to support our research and development activities and our operations. Macro-economic conditions in the United States and abroad as well as geo-political disruptions may result in a tightening of the credit markets and/or less capital available for small public companies, which may make it more difficult to raise capital. Specifically, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which could increase the cost of capital or volatility and adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. If we are unable to raise funds as and when we need them, we may be forced to curtail our operations or even cease operating altogether. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic and geo-political conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, could have a negative impact on us. It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.\nOur technology may not be successful in developing commercial products.\nWe and our potential future collaborators may spend many years and dedicate significant financial and other resources developing our technology that may never be successfully commercialized. Our technology may never become successfully commercialized for any of the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nWe may not be able to secure sufficient funding to progress our technology through development and commercial validation;\n\u00b7\nWe or our future collaborators may be unable to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our technology;\n\u00b7\nCompetitors may launch competing or more effective technology;\n\u00b7\nOur technology may not be commercially successful;\n\u00b7\nCurrent and future collaborators may be unable to fully develop and commercialize products containing our technology or may decide, for whatever reason, not to commercialize such products; and\n\u00b7\nWe may be unable to secure adequate patent protection in the necessary jurisdictions.\nIf any of these things were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nWe face business risks due to our relationships with strategic partners.\nWe rely on our strategic partner relationships for the scaling, manufacturing and commercialization of our technology. We have various arrangements with Indorama, SK geo centric and Suez to commercially scale our technology in Spartanburg, Asia and Europe respectively and with Chemtex and our external engineering partners. We also have various supply agreements with Danone, Pepsi, L\u2019Oreal and L\u2019OCCITANE en Provence for our planned commercial facilities. Termination of any of these agreements could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, certain of our agreements with our strategic partners have termination rights related to the satisfaction of milestones, some of which we have not achieved. Other than as noted below and though we have not received any indication from our strategic partners as to their indication to terminate, we cannot provide assurance that these strategic partners with whom we have entered into such agreements will not exercise their applicable termination rights, which are not within our control. For example, we previously announced that Coca-Cola Cross Enterprise Procurement Group (\u201cCEPG\u201d) advised us that it was terminating our Master Terms and Conditions Supply Agreement for Loop PET plastic, dated November 14, 2018 (the \u201cMTC\u201d) because we did not satisfy our first production milestone from the joint venture facility by July 2020 as required by the MTC. CEPG indicated in its notice that it is open and interested in exploring a new framework agreement with us for North America and/or Europe. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to enter into a new agreement with CEPG on terms that are favorable to us or at all.\nAny failure of our strategic partners or us to meet our required commitments, whether financial or otherwise, could result in a termination of such agreements as described above, operational issues, increased expenditures or damage to our reputation or loss of clients or customers, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations, financial performance or prospects.\nIf we are unable to successfully scale our manufacturing processes, we may not meet customer demand.\nTo be successful, we will have to scale our manufacturing processes while maintaining high product quality and reliability. If we cannot maintain high product quality at a large scale, our business will be adversely affected. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems with the supply of key components. Even if we are successful in developing our manufacturing capability, we do not know whether we will do so in time to satisfy the requirements of our customers. The current manufacturing facility is a small-scale plant with limited production capacity used principally for research and development, training and customer marketing purposes. In order to fully implement our business plan, we will need to scale the operations to a larger industrial commercial facility, develop strategic partnerships or find other means to produce greater volumes of finished product. We, however, have not yet tested our technology at the scale that will be required for large commercial use nor at a scale sufficient to conclude the success of our technology.\nDecreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness.\nOur success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDisruption at, damage to or destruction of our Terrebonne Facility could impede our ability to continue innovating and refining our technological process, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur research and development activities are performed from a single location in Terrebonne, Qu\u00e9bec. Our continued innovation activities rely on an uninterrupted and fully functioning plant. Interruptions in operations at this location could result in our inability to provide the most efficient and effective technological solution to our customers. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including, but not limited to, equipment malfunctions or failures, technology malfunctions, work stoppages or slow-downs, damage to or destruction of the facility or regional power shortages. As our equipment ages, it will need to be replaced. Any disruption that impedes our ability to optimize our process in a timely manner could reduce our revenues and materially harm our business.\nThe plastics manufacturing industry is extremely price-competitive because of the commodity-like nature of virgin PET resin and its correlation to the price of crude oil. If our cost to manufacture recycled PET is not competitive with virgin PET or if the price of oil reduces significantly, it may adversely impact our ability to penetrate the market or be profitable.\nThe demand for recycled PET has historically fluctuated with the price of crude oil. If crude oil prices decline, the cost to manufacture recycled PET may become comparatively higher than the cost to manufacture virgin PET. Our ability to penetrate the market will depend in part on the cost of manufacturing virgin PET and if we do not successfully distinguish our product from those of virgin PET manufacturers our entry into the market and our ability to secure customer contracts can be adversely affected.\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials.\nWe purchase raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations, the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. The profitability of our business also depends on the availability and proximity of these raw materials to our factories. The choice of raw materials to be used at our facility is determined primarily by the price and availability, the yield loss of lower quality raw materials, and the capabilities of the producer\u2019s production facility. Additionally, the cost of transportation could favor suppliers located in close proximity to our factories. If the quality of these raw materials is lower, the quality of our product may suffer. Economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our feedstock supply strategy, including any hedging procedures, may be insufficient, and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. In light of the uncertain and evolving situation relating to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our access to raw materials, the quality and proximity of such materials may be disrupted. We currently cannot predict the impact that the global COVID-19 pandemic will have on our access to raw materials.\nThe loss of the services of Mr. Daniel Solomita, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our business.\nThe development of our business and the marketing of our prospective products will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel, management, and other resources. Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers who are developing our business, and on our ability to identify and retain competent consultants and employees with the skills required to execute our business objectives. The loss of the services of Mr. Daniel Solomita or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our business which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us and investigations we are subject to, and adverse results may harm our business.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, of prosecution or of the ultimate outcome of litigation, investigations and other proceedings filed by or against us, including penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions, or remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in any litigation and other proceedings may materially harm our business, including the subpoena we received from the SEC in October 2020 requesting certain information regarding testing, testing results and details of results from our GEN I and GEN II technologies and certain of our partnerships and agreements. In March 2022, we received a subpoena requesting additional information, including information concerning our reverse-merger in 2015, and communications with certain individuals and entities. There have been no further information requests relating to the Company\u2019s business or technology. Litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, international trade, commercial arrangements, product liability, environmental, health and safety, joint venture agreements, labor and employment or other harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities outside of our control. In the case of intellectual property litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of business processes or technology that are subject to third-party patents or other third-party intellectual property rights. We expect to continue to incur legal fees in relation to litigation, investigations and other proceedings.\nWe were named as a defendant in putative shareholder class action lawsuits and are subject to an SEC Investigation which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation.\nWe are defending against putative shareholder class action lawsuits described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings-Litigation,\u201d including any appeals of such lawsuit. We are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or possible range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of these lawsuits. In the event that our initial defense of these lawsuits is unsuccessful, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any appeal. Any adverse outcome, including any plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the judgment in this case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurance carriers will cover all or part of the defense costs, or any liabilities that may arise from these matters. The litigation process may utilize a significant portion of our cash resources and divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our company, all of which could harm our business. We also may be subject to claims for indemnification related to these matters, and we cannot predict the impact that indemnification claims may have on our business or financial results.\nAs explained in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, we have entered a settlement for the consolidated class action In re Loop Industries, Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No. 7:20-cv-08538-NSR. The settlement is subject to conditions including court approval. There is no guarantee that the settlement will become final.\nIn addition, as described in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings-SEC Investigation,\u201d of this annual report, the SEC in October 2020 requesting certain information regarding testing, testing results and details of results from our GEN I and GEN II technologies and certain of our partnerships and agreements. In March 2022, we received a subpoena requesting additional information, including information concerning our reverse-merger in 2015, and communications with certain individuals and entities. There have been no further information requests relating to the Company\u2019s business or technology. We cannot predict or provide any assurance as to the timing, outcome or consequences of the SEC investigation. If the SEC were to conclude that enforcement action is appropriate, we could be required to pay civil penalties and fines, and the SEC could impose other sanctions against us or against our current and former officers and directors. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with matters relating to or arising from the SEC investigation. In addition, our board of directors, management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on the SEC investigation, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, while the SEC has informed us that the investigation should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violation of law has occurred, nor as a reflection upon any person, entity or security, publicity surrounding the foregoing, or any SEC enforcement action or settlement as a result of the SEC\u2019s investigation, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash position.\nOur Terrebonne Facility or other planned facilities must operate under policies, procedures, and controls for the operation of a chemical manufacturing facility as required under various federal, provincial and local regulations and codes. Failure to comply with such regulations and codes may lead to disruption of operations at the Terrebonne Facility or other planned facilities and the development of our technology, and financial sanctions.\nWe are subject to health and safety as well as environmental, zoning and any other regulatory requirements to operate our Terrebonne Facility and our other planned facilities, and as our business evolves, we, directly or indirectly through our partners or other related parties, may be subject to additional government regulations. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, as well as discovery of previously unknown problems, may result in, among other things, costly regulatory inspections, fines or remediation plans. If regulatory issues arise, the value of our business and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, applicable regulations may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impact our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in Canada, the United States or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, are slow or unable to adopt new requirements or policies, or effect changes to existing requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may significantly impair our competitive advantage.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection, confidentiality, nondisclosure and non-use agreements to protect our proprietary rights. The steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The patent and trademark law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks and similar proprietary rights.\nWe may face costly intellectual property infringement claims, the result of which would decrease the amount of cash available to operate and complete our business plan.\nWe anticipate that, from time to time, we will receive communications from third parties asserting that we are infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others or seeking indemnification against alleged infringement. If anticipated claims arise, we will evaluate their merits. Any claims of infringement brought forth by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation, damages for infringement, and the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Litigation, which could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our resources, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely in part on trade secrets to protect our technology, and our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could harm our business.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology and proprietary information, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Litigating a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and used our trade secrets would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop similar knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common stock.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d). Section 404 requires us to include an internal control report with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must include management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as at the end of the fiscal year. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified.\nThe process of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is time consuming, costly and complicated. If during the evaluation and testing process, we identify one or more other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or determine that existing material weaknesses have not been remediated, our management will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented or reviewed. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations.\nWe operate mainly through two entities, Loop Industries, Inc., which is a Nevada corporation and has a U.S. dollar functional currency, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Loop Canada Inc. (\u201cLoop Canada\u201d), which is based in Terrebonne, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and has a Canadian dollar functional currency. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.\nWe mainly finance our operations through the sale and issuance of shares of common stock of Loop Industries, Inc. in U.S. dollars while our operations are concentrated in our wholly-owned subsidiary, Loop Canada. Additionally, we are planning a commercial development project in B\u00e9cancour, Qu\u00e9bec which is expected to involve the purchase of various equipment primarily in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as we maintain bank accounts in U.S. dollars and a significant portion of our operational costs (including payroll, site costs, costs of locally sourced supplies and income taxes) are denominated in Canadian dollars.\nSignificant fluctuations in U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rates could materially affect our result of operations, cash position and funding requirements. To the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ materially from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. As part of our risk management program, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to lock in the exchange rates for future foreign currency transactions, which is intended to reduce the variability of our operating costs and future cash flows denominated in currencies that differ from our functional currencies. We do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation, and our management believes all such contracts are entered into as hedges of underlying transactions. Nonetheless, these instruments involve costs and have risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk. If our hedging program is not successful, or if we change our hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. Any hedging technique we implement may fail to be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations and failure to secure and maintain permits could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany federal, provincial, state and local regulations govern plants and facilities and licenses to be held by individuals. We are in the process of obtaining all necessary permits and approvals for the operation of our business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where our regulated activities are operated. As these are governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, the duration of the permit and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit.\nWe believe that we have all licenses required to conduct our operations and are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our permits and licenses or an inability to perform work, which could adversely affect our business.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SECURITIES\nRaising additional funds may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nIf we raise additional funds through equity offerings or offerings of equity-linked securities, including warrants or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Our existing $15 and $20 warrants are subject to a broad based weighted average anti-dilution provision, which may result in a reduction of the warrant exercise price if new equity above $65 million is raised under certain levels. The warrant exercise prices cannot be adjusted to less than $12.45. Debt financings, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities, including covenants limiting or restricting our ability to incur additional debt, dispose of assets or incur capital expenditures. We may also incur ongoing interest expense and be required to grant a security interest in our assets in connection with any debt issuance. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships or licensing agreements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nTrading volume in our stock can fluctuate and an active trading market for our common stock may not be available on a consistent basis to provide stockholders with adequate liquidity. Our stock price may be volatile, and our stockholders could incur significant investment losses.\nThe trading price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nany change in the status of our Nasdaq listing;\n\u00b7\nthe need for near-term financing to continue operations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop and commercialize our technology, relative to investor expectations;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nvolatility in the financial and credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the current COVID-19 outbreak and geo-political events;\n\u00b7\nfuture issuances and/or sales of our securities;\n\u00b7\nannouncements or the absence of announcements by us, or our competitors, regarding collaborations, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation or investigations;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nannouncements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation involving our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\na lack of, or limited, or negative industry or security analyst coverage;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty regarding our ability to secure additional cash resources with which to operate our business;\n\u00b7\nshort-selling or similar activities by third parties;\n\u00b7\nlimited trading liquidity in our shares and any short positions held; and\n\u00b7\nother factors described elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nAs a result of these factors, our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at, or above, their purchase price. In addition, the stock prices of many technology companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of companies in our industry could depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of our common stock and affect our ability to obtain required financing.\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Daniel Solomita, beneficially owns a majority of the total voting power of our capital stock, and accordingly, has control over stockholder matters, our business and management.\nAs at May 25, 2022, Mr. Daniel Solomita, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and controlling shareholder, beneficially owns 19,210,000 shares of common stock, or 40.5% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and also holds one share of Series A Preferred Stock. The one share of Series A Preferred Stock issued to Mr. Solomita holds a majority of the total voting power so long as Mr. Solomita holds not less than 7.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, assuring Mr. Solomita of control of the Company in the event that his ownership of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock is diluted to a level below a majority. Currently, Mr. Solomita\u2019s beneficial ownership of 19,210,000 shares of common stock and 1 share of Series A Preferred Stock provides him with 75.8% of the voting control of the Company.\nAdditionally, the one share of Series A Preferred Stock issued to Mr. Solomita contains protective provisions, which precludes us from taking certain actions without Mr. Solomita\u2019s (or that of any person to whom the one share of Series A Preferred Stock is transferred) approval. More specifically, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, we are not permitted to take certain actions without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, including for example and without limitation, amending our articles of incorporation, changing or modifying the rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, including increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock, increasing or decreasing the size of the board of directors or remove the director appointed by the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and declaring or paying any dividend or other distribution.\nMoreover, because of the significant ownership position held by our insiders, new investors may not be able to effect a change in our business or management, and therefore, stockholders would have no recourse as a result of decisions made by management.\nIn addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by Mr. Solomita, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Management\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain provisions of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of our company.\nThough not now, we may in the future become subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada\u2019s control share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a \u201ccontrolling interest\u201d which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the company in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.\nThe effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of our stockholders, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest, their shares do not become governed by the control share law.\nIf control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record, other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights, is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder\u2019s shares.\nIn addition to the control share law, Nevada has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years after the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the company\u2019s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the company, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the company and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the company. The definition of the term \u201ccombination\u201d is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquirer to use the company\u2019s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the company and its other stockholders.\nThe effect of Nevada\u2019s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. Stockholders may not be able to sell shares when desired. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that there are various risks. You should consider carefully these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in tax legislation in the countries the Company has operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating loss carryforwards, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. The impact of enactment of U.S. tax reform was recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business and we urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17116, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "LOOP"}
