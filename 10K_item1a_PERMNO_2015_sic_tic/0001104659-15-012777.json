RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition and Economic Risks Affecting our Business\nWe face intense and increasing competition from satellite television providers, cable companies and telecommunications companies, especially as the pay-TV industry has matured, which may require us to further increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn.\nOur business is primarily focused on providing pay-TV services and we have traditionally competed against satellite television providers and cable companies, some of whom have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Many of these competitors offer video services bundled with broadband, telephony services, HD offerings, interactive services and video on demand services that consumers may find attractive. We and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other\u2019s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. In addition, because other pay-TV providers may be seeking to attract a greater proportion of their new subscribers from our existing subscriber base, we may be required to increase retention spending or we may provide greater discounts or credits to acquire and retain subscribers who may spend less on our services. If our Pay-TV ARPU decreases or does not increase commensurate with increases in programming or other costs, our margins may be reduced and the long-term value of a subscriber would then decrease.\nCompetition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured and the growth of fiber-based pay-TV services offered by telecommunications companies such as Verizon and AT&T continues. These fiber-based pay-TV services have significantly greater capacity, enabling the telecommunications companies to offer substantial HD programming content as well as bundled services. This increasingly competitive environment may require us to increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn. Further, as a result of this increased competitive environment and the maturation of the pay-TV industry, future growth opportunities of our core pay-TV business may be limited and our margins may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nMoreover, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances among cable television providers, telecommunications companies and others may result in, among other things, greater financial leverage and increase the availability of offerings from providers capable of bundling television, broadband and telephone services in competition with our services, and may exacerbate the risks described above. For example, during February 2014, Comcast announced its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable, which would combine the largest and second\nlargest cable television providers in the U.S. This acquisition is currently undergoing regulatory review and has not been completed. We filed a petition to deny the transaction with the FCC, in which we stated, among other things, that the proposed transaction poses serious harm to competition and consumers and runs counter to U.S. antitrust and communications laws, that no set of conditions can alleviate these harms, and that the FCC and Department of Justice should reject the transaction. If Time Warner Cable ultimately is acquired by Comcast, the combined company would be able to, among other things, foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; impose anti-competitive data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings; foreclose access to, or raise the prices of, its own affiliated programming to us; pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; and utilize its increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price it pays for programming at the expense of other MVPDs, including us.\nIn addition, during May 2014, AT&T announced its pending acquisition of DirecTV, our direct competitor and the largest satellite TV provider in the U.S. This acquisition is currently undergoing regulatory review and has not been completed. We filed a petition to impose conditions on the transaction with the FCC, to remedy potential threats to consumers and competition in the video and broadband markets. If DirecTV ultimately is acquired by AT&T, DirecTV will, among other things, have increased access to capital, access to AT&T\u2019s nationwide platform for wireless mobile video, and the ability to more seamlessly bundle its video services with AT&T\u2019s broadband Internet access and voice services. The combined company would also be able to, among other things, pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; utilize its increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price it pays for programming at the expense of other MVPDs, including us; thwart our entry into the wireless market, by, among other things, refusing to enter into data roaming agreements with us; underutilize key orbital spectrum resources that could be more efficiently used by us; foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; and impose anti-competitive data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings.\nCompetition from digital media companies that provide or facilitate the delivery of video content via the Internet may reduce our gross new subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us.\nOur business is primarily focused on pay-TV services, and we face competition from providers of digital media, including, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon and Google that offer online services distributing movies, television shows and other video programming. In addition, traditional providers of video entertainment, including broadcasters and cable network operators, are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Moreover, new technologies have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors we face with respect to video services, including competition from piracy-based video offerings. With the large increase in the number of consumers with broadband service, a significant amount of video content has become available through online platforms for users to stream and view on their personal computers, televisions and other devices. These online platforms may cause our subscribers to disconnect our services (\u201ccord cutting\u201d), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages (\u201ccord shaving\u201d) or elect to purchase through online platforms a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. Some of these companies have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In particular, programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices. These technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which they obtain video content could reduce our gross new subscriber activations and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our business.\nA substantial majority of our revenue comes from residential customers whose spending patterns may be affected by economic weakness and uncertainty. Our ability to grow or maintain our business may be adversely affected by economic weakness and uncertainty and other factors that may adversely affect the pay-TV industry. In particular, economic weakness and uncertainty could result in the following:\n\u00b7 Fewer gross new subscriber activations and increased subscriber churn. We could face fewer gross new subscriber activations and increased subscriber churn due to, among other things: (i) a downturn in the\nhousing market in the United States combined with lower discretionary spending; (ii) increased price competition for our products and services; and (iii) the potential loss of retailers, who generate a significant portion of our new subscribers, because many of them are small businesses that are more susceptible to the negative effects of economic weakness. In particular, subscriber churn may increase with respect to subscribers who purchase our lower tier programming packages and who may be more sensitive to economic weakness, including, among others, our pay-in-advance subscribers.\n\u00b7 Lower pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber (\u201cPay-TV ARPU\u201d). Due to increasing programming costs, our subscribers may disconnect our services and a growing share of pay-TV customers are \u201ccord shaving\u201d to downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages or electing to purchase through online platforms a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies. Cord cutting and/or cord shaving by our subscribers could negatively impact our Pay-TV ARPU.\n\u00b7 Higher subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our profits may be adversely affected by increased subscriber acquisition and retention costs necessary to attract and retain subscribers during a period of economic weakness.\nOur competitors may be able to leverage their relationships with programmers to reduce their programming costs and offer exclusive content that will place them at a competitive advantage to us.\nThe cost of programming represents the largest percentage of our overall costs. Certain of our competitors own directly or are affiliated with companies that own programming content that may enable them to obtain lower programming costs or offer exclusive programming that may be attractive to prospective subscribers. Unlike our larger cable and satellite competitors, we have not made significant investments in programming providers. For example, in January 2011, the FCC and the Department of Justice approved a transaction between Comcast and General Electric pursuant to which they joined their programming properties, including NBC, Bravo and many others that are available in the majority of our programming packages, in a venture, NBCUniversal, controlled by Comcast. During March 2013, Comcast completed the acquisition of substantially all of General Electric\u2019s remaining interest in NBCUniversal. This transaction may affect us adversely by, among other things, making it more difficult for us to obtain access to NBCUniversal\u2019s programming networks on nondiscriminatory and fair terms, or at all. The FCC conditioned its approval on, among other things, Comcast complying with the terms of the FCC\u2019s order on network neutrality, even if that order is vacated by judicial or legislative action, and Comcast licensing its affiliated content to us, other traditional pay-TV providers and certain providers of video services over the Internet on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, including, among others, price. If Comcast does not license its affiliated content to us on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, we can seek binding arbitration and continue to carry such content while the arbitration is pending. However, it is uncertain how these conditions may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these conditions.\nAs a new service offering, our OTT services face certain risks, including, among others, significant competition.\nOn February 9, 2015, we launched Sling TV, a live, linear streaming OTT service. Prior to the launch of Sling TV, we offered, and continue to offer, an international video programming OTT service to a small number of Pay-TV subscribers under the DishWorld brand. As of December 31, 2014, DishWorld subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count and represent a small percentage of our customers. We market our OTT services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services.\nOur OTT services face a number of risks, including, among others, the following, which may have a material adverse effect on our OTT service offerings:\n\u00b7 We face significant competition from several competitors, including, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon and Google, who have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, stronger brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources, as well as competition from piracy-based video offerings;\n\u00b7 We offer a limited amount of programming content, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to increase the amount or type of programming content that we may offer to keep pace with, or to differentiate our OTT services from, other providers of online video content;\n\u00b7 We rely on streaming-capable devices to deliver our OTT services, and if we are not successful in maintaining existing, and creating new, relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing or other impediments to our streaming content, our ability to grow our OTT services could be adversely impacted;\n\u00b7 We may incur significant expenses to market our OTT services and build brand awareness, which could have a negative impact on the profitability of our OTT services;\n\u00b7 Since we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our OTT services through an Internet connection, changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our OTT services. For example, if the proposed Comcast/Time Warner Cable and AT&T/DirecTV mergers are completed, these risks may be exacerbated;\n\u00b7 Our OTT services have functional limitations that in many cases our competitors are not constrained by, such as not being able to view content on more than one device simultaneously, and not providing consumers a feature to record content for future viewing. If we are unable to add such functionality to our OTT services in the future, our ability to compete with other offerings could be adversely impacted.\n\u00b7 The adoption or modification of laws and regulations relating to the Internet could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our OTT services and could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model; and\n\u00b7 We rely on EchoStar to provide the IPTV streaming technology to support our OTT services. In addition, we license our OTT service brand name \u201cSling\u201d from EchoStar, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to license the \u201cSling\u201d brand name on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe face increasing competition from other distributors of unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming that may limit our ability to maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services.\nWe face increasing competition from other distributors of unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming, including programming distributed over the Internet. There can be no assurance that we will maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services. For example, the increasing availability of foreign language programming from our competitors, which in certain cases has resulted from our inability to renew programming agreements on an exclusive basis or at all, as well as competition from piracy-based video offerings, could contribute to an increase in our subscriber churn. Our agreements with distributors of foreign language programming have varying expiration dates, and some agreements are on a month-to-month basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to grow or maintain subscribers that desire these unique programming services such as foreign language and sports programming.\nOperational and Service Delivery Risks Affecting our Business\nIf we do not continue improving our operational performance and customer satisfaction, our gross new subscriber activations may decrease and our subscriber churn may increase.\nIf we are unable to continue improving our operational performance and customer satisfaction, we may experience a decrease in gross new subscriber activations and an increase in subscriber churn, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce subscriber churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot, however, be\ncertain that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance, and if unsuccessful, we may have to incur higher costs to improve our operational performance. While we believe that such costs will be outweighed by longer-term benefits, there can be no assurance when or if we will realize these benefits at all. If we are unable to improve our operational performance, our future gross new subscriber activations and existing subscriber churn may be negatively impacted, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations.\nIf our gross new subscriber activations decrease, or if our subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs or retention costs increase, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe may incur increased costs to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. Our subscriber acquisition costs could increase as a result of increased spending for advertising and the installation of more HD and DVR receivers, which are generally more expensive than other receivers. Meanwhile, retention costs may be driven higher by increased upgrades of existing subscribers\u2019 equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits. Additionally, certain of our promotions, including, among others, pay-in-advance, allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers. These subscribers typically churn at a higher rate.\nOur subscriber acquisition costs and our subscriber retention costs can vary significantly from period to period and can cause material variability to our net income (loss) and adjusted free cash flow. Any material increase in subscriber acquisition or retention costs from current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProgramming expenses are increasing and could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.\nOur programming costs currently represent the largest component of our total expense and we expect these costs to continue to increase. The pay-TV industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially local broadcast channels and sports programming. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices.\nWhen offering new programming, or upon expiration of existing contracts, programming suppliers have historically attempted to increase the rates they charge us for programming. We expect this practice to continue, which, if successful, would increase our programming costs. As a result, our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Alternatively, to attempt to mitigate the effect of price increases, we may elect not to carry certain channels, which could adversely affect our subscriber growth or result in higher churn.\nIn addition, increases in programming costs could cause us to increase the rates that we charge our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Therefore, we may be unable to pass increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on others to provide the programming that we offer to our subscribers and, if we lose access to this programming, our gross new subscriber activations may decline and our subscriber churn may increase.\nWe depend on third parties to provide us with programming services. Our programming agreements have remaining terms ranging from less than one to up to several years and contain various renewal, expiration and/or termination provisions. We may not be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms or at all, and these agreements may be terminated prior to expiration of their original term. Certain programmers have, in the past, limited our access to their programming in connection with the scheduled expiration of their programming carriage contracts with us. In recent years, national and local programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions have become more frequent and in certain cases have had a negative impact on our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and Pay-TV churn rate. For example, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively\nimpacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with several content providers, including, among others, Turner Networks, 21st Century Fox and certain local network affiliates. In particular, we suffered from lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rate beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015, when, among others, certain programming from 21st Century Fox, including Fox entertainment and news channels, was not available on our service. Although we believe that the impact of the programming interruptions that occurred beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continued in the first quarter 2015 has now subsided, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rates as we did beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015.\nWe typically have a few programming contracts with major content providers up for renewal each year and if we are unable to renew any of these agreements or the other parties terminate the agreements, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In addition, loss of access to programming, particularly programming provided by major content providers and/or programming popular with our subscribers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, our gross new subscriber activations, net subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate.\nWe may not be able to obtain necessary retransmission consent agreements at acceptable rates, or at all, from local network stations.\nThe Copyright Act generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of local network stations that do not elect \u201cmust carry\u201d status, as required by the Communications Act. If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with such broadcasters, we cannot carry their signals. This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that provide local signals. While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most of these local network stations, from time to time there are stations with which we have not been able to reach an agreement. We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements on acceptable terms, or at all, upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short-term. We currently have pending lawsuits with two major broadcast television networks alleging, among other things, that the PrimeTime Anytime\u2122 and AutoHop\u2122 features of the Hopper set-top box breach their retransmission consent agreements. See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. In the event a court ultimately determines that we breached the terms of these retransmission consent agreements, we may be subject, among other things, to substantial damages and we may lose access to programming or may not be able to renew certain of our retransmission consent agreements and other programming agreements on favorable terms or at all. Even if we ultimately prevail in these actions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our retransmission consent agreements or enter into new agreements with these broadcast networks. In such event, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain substitute programming, or that such substitute programming would be comparable in quality or cost to our existing programming. In recent years, national broadcasters have used their ownership of certain local broadcast stations to require us to carry additional cable programming in exchange for retransmission consent of their local broadcast stations. These requirements may place constraints on available capacity on our satellites for other programming. Furthermore, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our customers. We may be unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to make substantial additional investments to maintain competitive programming offerings.\nWe believe that the availability and extent of HD programming and other value-added services such as access to video via smartphones and tablets continue to be significant factors in consumers\u2019 choice among pay-TV providers. Other pay-TV providers may have more successfully marketed and promoted their HD programming packages and value-added services and may also be better equipped and have greater resources to increase their HD offerings and\nvalue-added services to respond to increasing consumer demand. In addition, even though it remains a small portion of the market, consumer demand for 3D televisions and programming, as well as higher resolution programming, such as 4K HD, will likely increase in the future. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in infrastructure to respond to competitive pressure to deliver enhanced programming, and other value-added services, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with offerings from other pay-TV providers.\nAny failure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure and communications systems could disrupt or harm our business.\nThe capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure (including our billing systems) and communications systems are important to the operation of our current business, which would suffer in the event of system failures or cyber attacks. Likewise, our ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our new service offering initiatives. Our inability to expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include, among other things, the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions, and the diversion of development resources. For example, during 2012, we implemented a new billing system as well as new sales and customer care systems. We are relying on third parties for developing key components of our information technology and communications systems and ongoing service after their implementation. Some of these systems and operations are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Third parties may experience errors, cyber attacks, natural disasters or other disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Interruption and/or failure of any of these systems could disrupt our operations, interrupt our services and damage our reputation, thus adversely impacting our ability to provide our services, retain our current subscribers and attract new subscribers.\nIn addition, although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems may be vulnerable to cyber attacks and other malicious activities including, among other things, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, computer denial of service attacks and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our customer and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and communications systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. Due to the fast-moving pace of technology, it may be difficult to detect, contain and remediate every such event. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses.\nAs a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, the liability associated with information-related risks is increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle personal customer data. The occurrence of any such network or information system related events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant incidents could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or a loss of customers and revenues.\nWe currently depend on EchoStar Corporation and its subsidiaries, or EchoStar, to design, develop and manufacture substantially all of our new set-top boxes and certain related components, to provide the vast majority of our transponder capacity, to provide digital broadcast operations and other services to us, and to provide the IPTV streaming technology for our OTT services. Our business would be adversely affected if EchoStar ceases to provide these products and services to us and we are unable to obtain suitable replacement products and services from third parties.\nEchoStar is our primary supplier of digital set-top boxes and digital broadcast operations. In addition, EchoStar provides the vast majority of our transponder capacity, is a key supplier of related services to us, and provides the IPTV streaming technology for our OTT services. We purchase digital set-top boxes from EchoStar pursuant to a\ncontract that expires on December 31, 2015. EchoStar provides digital broadcast operations to us pursuant to a contract that expires on December 31, 2016. EchoStar has no obligation to supply digital set-top boxes or digital broadcast operations to us after these dates. We may be unable to renew agreements for digital set-top boxes or digital broadcast operations with EchoStar on acceptable terms or at all. We lease the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar. Equipment, transponder leasing and digital broadcast operation costs may increase beyond our current expectations. EchoStar\u2019s inability to develop and produce, or our inability to obtain, equipment with the latest technology, or our inability to obtain transponder capacity and digital broadcast operations and other services from third parties, could adversely affect our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn rate and cause related revenue to decline.\nFurthermore, due to the lack of compatibility of our infrastructure with the set-top boxes of a provider other than EchoStar, any transition to a new supplier of set-top boxes could take a significant period of time to complete, cause us to incur significant costs and negatively affect our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn. For example, the proprietary nature of the Slingbox \u201cplaceshifting\u201d functionality and certain other technology used in EchoStar\u2019s set-top boxes may significantly limit our ability to obtain set-top boxes with the same or similar features from any other provider of set-top boxes.\nIf we were to switch to another provider of set-top boxes, we may have to implement additional infrastructure to support the set-top boxes purchased from such new provider, which could significantly increase our costs. In addition, differences in, among other things, the user interface between set-top boxes provided by EchoStar and those of any other provider could cause subscriber confusion, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn. Furthermore, switching to a new provider of set-top boxes may cause a reduction in our supply of set-top boxes and thus delay our ability to ship set-top boxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn rate and cause related revenue to decline.\nWe operate in an extremely competitive environment and our success may depend in part on our timely introduction and implementation of, and effective investment in, new competitive products and services, the failure of which could negatively impact our business.\nOur operating results are dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to continue to introduce new products and services and to upgrade existing products and services on a timely basis, and to reduce costs of our existing products and services. We may not be able to successfully identify new product or service opportunities or develop and market these opportunities in a timely or cost-effective manner. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment. The success of new product and service development depends on many factors, including among others, the following:\n\u00b7 difficulties and delays in the development, production, timely completion, testing and marketing of products and services;\n\u00b7 the cost of the products and services;\n\u00b7 proper identification of customer need and customer acceptance of products and services;\n\u00b7 the development of, approval of and compliance with industry standards;\n\u00b7 the significant amount of resources we must devote to the development of new technologies; and\n\u00b7 the ability to differentiate our products and services and compete with other companies in the same markets.\nIf our products and services, including without limitation, our Hopper and Joey set-top boxes, are not competitive or do not work properly, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. If the quality of our products and services do not meet our customers\u2019 expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and revenues, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nTechnology in our industry changes rapidly and our inability to offer new subscribers and upgrade existing subscribers with more advanced equipment could cause our products and services to become obsolete.\nTechnology in the pay-TV industry changes rapidly as new technologies are developed, which could cause our products and services to become obsolete. We and our suppliers may not be able to keep pace with technological developments. If the new technologies on which we intend to focus our research and development investments fail to achieve acceptance in the marketplace, our competitive position could be negatively impacted causing a reduction in our revenues and earnings. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage in developing and introducing complex new products and services because of the substantial costs we may incur in making these products or services available across our installed base of approximately 14 million subscribers. For example, our competitors could use proprietary technologies that are perceived by the market as being superior. Further, after we have incurred substantial costs, one or more of the products or services under our development, or under development by one or more of our strategic partners, could become obsolete prior to it being widely adopted.\nIn addition, our competitive position depends in part on our ability to offer new subscribers and upgrade existing subscribers with more advanced equipment, such as receivers with DVR and HD technology and by otherwise making additional infrastructure investments, such as those related to our information technology and call centers. Furthermore, the continued demand for HD programming continues to require investments in additional satellite capacity. We may not be able to pass on to our subscribers the entire cost of these upgrades and infrastructure investments.\nNew technologies could also create new competitors for us. For instance, we face increasing consumer demand for the delivery of digital video services via the Internet, including providing what we refer to as \u201cDISH Anywhere.\u201d We expect to continue to face increased threats from companies who use the Internet to deliver digital video services as the speed and quality of broadband and wireless networks continues to improve.\nTechnological innovation is important to our success and depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled employees. We rely on EchoStar to design, develop and manufacture set-top boxes with advanced features and functionality and to provide the IPTV streaming technology for our OTT services. If EchoStar is unable to attract and retain appropriately technically skilled employees, our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, delays in the delivery of components or other unforeseen problems associated with our technology may occur that could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, offer new products and services and remain competitive.\nWe rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, and security access devices, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have contracted with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as information technology support, billing systems, and security access devices. If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they fail to perform adequately, are no longer in business, are experiencing shortages or discontinue a certain product or service we need, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. While alternative sources for these products and services exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to timely deliver our products to our subscribers or operate our business. Furthermore, our vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments.\nOur primary supplier of new set-top boxes, EchoStar, relies on a few suppliers and in some cases a single supplier, for many components of our new set-top boxes, and any reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business.\nEchoStar relies on a few suppliers and in some cases a single supplier, for many components of our new set-top boxes that we provide to subscribers in order to deliver our digital television services. Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on EchoStar\u2019s ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from suppliers. In the event of an interruption of supply or a significant price increase from these suppliers, EchoStar may not be able to diversify sources of supply in a timely manner, which could have a negative impact on our business. Further, due to increased demand for products, many electronic manufacturers are experiencing shortages for certain components. EchoStar has experienced in the past and may continue to\nexperience shortages driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters, logistical delays and significant changes in the financial or business conditions of its suppliers that negatively impact our operations. Any such delays or constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, our gross new subscriber activations.\nOur programming signals are subject to theft, and we are vulnerable to other forms of fraud that could require us to make significant expenditures to remedy.\nIncreases in theft of our signal or our competitors\u2019 signals could, in addition to reducing gross new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase. To combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called \u201csmart cards,\u201d or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content (\u201cSecurity Access Devices\u201d).\nOur signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. We expect that future replacements of these Security Access Devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system\u2019s security is compromised.\nWe are also vulnerable to other forms of fraud. While we are addressing certain fraud through a number of actions, including terminating retailers that we believe violated our business rules, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud which could impact our gross new subscriber activations and subscriber churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and other forms of fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue.\nWe depend on third parties to solicit orders for our services that represent a significant percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations.\nWhile we offer receiver systems and programming through direct sales channels, a significant percentage of our total gross new subscriber activations are generated through independent third parties such as small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores, nationwide retailers, and telecommunications companies. Most of our retailers are not exclusive to us and some of our retailers may favor our competitors\u2019 products and services over ours based on the relative financial arrangements associated with marketing our products and services and those of our competitors. Furthermore, most of these retailers are significantly smaller than we are and may be more susceptible to economic weaknesses that make it more difficult for them to operate profitably. Because our retailers receive most of their incentive value at activation and not over an extended period of time, our interests may not always be aligned with our retailers. It may be difficult to better align our interests with our retailers because of their capital and liquidity constraints. Loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our subscriber base and certain of our other key operating metrics because we may not be able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels.\nWe have limited satellite capacity and failures or reduced capacity could adversely affect our business.\nOperation of our programming service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. We lease substantially all of our satellite capacity from third parties, including the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar, and we do not carry commercial insurance on any of the satellites that we lease from them.\nOur ability to earn revenue depends on the usefulness of our owned and leased satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including, among other things, the quality of their construction, the durability of their component parts, the ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite\u2019s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, and the remaining on-board fuel following orbit insertion. Generally, the minimum design life of each of our satellites ranges from 12 to 15 years. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual useful lives of any of these satellites. Our operating results could be adversely affected if the useful life of any of our owned or leased satellites were significantly shorter than the minimum design life.\nIn the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive. A relocation would require FCC approval and, among other things, a showing to the FCC that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be certain that we could obtain such FCC approval. If we choose to use a satellite in this manner, this use could adversely affect our ability to satisfy certain operational conditions associated with our authorizations. Failure to satisfy those conditions could result in the loss of such authorizations, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.\nOur owned and leased satellites are subject to construction, launch, operational and environmental risks that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites.\nConstruction and launch risks. A key component of our business strategy is our ability to expand our offering of new programming and services. To accomplish this goal, from time to time, new satellites need to be built and launched. Satellite construction and launch is subject to significant risks, including construction and launch delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the recent past. The risks of launch delay and failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of previous successful flights. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than three years, and to obtain other launch opportunities. Significant construction or launch delays could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. If we were unable to obtain launch insurance, or obtain launch insurance at rates we deem commercially reasonable, and a significant launch failure were to occur, it could impact our ability to fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities.\nIn addition, the occurrence of future launch failures for other operators may delay the deployment of our satellites and materially and adversely affect our ability to insure the launch of our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums, if at all. Please see further discussion under the caption \u201cWe generally do not carry commercial insurance for any of the in-orbit satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and could face significant impairment charges if any of our owned satellites fail\u201d below.\nOperational risks. Satellites are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, commonly referred to as anomalies that have occurred in our satellites and the satellites of other operators as a result of various factors, such as manufacturing defects, problems with the power systems or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from operating satellites in the harsh environment of space.\nAlthough we work closely with the satellite manufacturers to determine and eliminate the cause of anomalies in new satellites and provide for redundancies of many critical components in the satellites, we may experience anomalies in the future, whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components.\nAny single anomaly or series of anomalies could materially and adversely affect our operations and revenues and our relationship with current customers, as well as our ability to attract new customers for our pay-TV services. In particular, future anomalies may result in the loss of individual transponders on a satellite, a group of transponders on that satellite or the entire satellite, depending on the nature of the anomaly. Anomalies may also reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby reducing the channels that could be offered using that satellite, or create additional expenses due to the need to provide replacement or back-up satellites. You should review the disclosures\nrelating to satellite anomalies set forth under Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental risks. Meteoroid events pose a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites. The probability that meteoroids will damage those satellites increases significantly when the Earth passes through the particulate stream left behind by comets. Occasionally, increased solar activity also poses a potential threat to all in-orbit satellites.\nSome decommissioned satellites are in uncontrolled orbits that pass through the geostationary belt at various points, and present hazards to operational satellites, including our satellites. We may be required to perform maneuvers to avoid collisions and these maneuvers may prove unsuccessful or could reduce the useful life of the satellite through the expenditure of fuel to perform these maneuvers. The loss, damage or destruction of any of our satellites as a result of an electrostatic storm, collision with space debris, malfunction or other event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally do not carry commercial insurance for any of the in-orbit satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and could face significant impairment charges if any of our owned satellites fail.\nGenerally, we do not carry launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites we use. We currently do not carry in-orbit insurance on any of our owned or leased satellites, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. We lease substantially all of our satellite capacity from third parties, including the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar, and we do not carry commercial insurance on any of the satellites we lease from them. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. If one or more of our owned in-orbit satellites fail, we could be required to record significant impairment charges.\nWe may have potential conflicts of interest with EchoStar due to our common ownership and management.\nQuestions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between EchoStar and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. Areas in which conflicts of interest between EchoStar and us could arise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 Cross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. We have certain overlap in directors and executive officers with EchoStar. These individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. Our Board of Directors and executive officers include persons who are members of the Board of Directors of EchoStar, including Charles W. Ergen, who serves as the Chairman of EchoStar and us. The executive officers and the members of our Board of Directors who overlap with EchoStar have fiduciary duties to EchoStar\u2019s shareholders. For example, there is the potential for a conflict of interest when we or EchoStar look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. In addition, certain of our directors and officers own EchoStar stock and options to purchase EchoStar stock. Mr. Ergen owns approximately 36.5% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially owns approximately 43.6% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, Mr. Ergen controls approximately 62.4% of the voting power of EchoStar. Mr. Ergen\u2019s ownership of EchoStar excludes 15,188,445 shares of its Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of its Class B Common Stock currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. These trusts own approximately 16.6% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially own approximately 25.7% of EchoStar\u2019s total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by such trusts into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, these trusts possess approximately 29.2% of EchoStar\u2019s total voting power. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and EchoStar. Furthermore, Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, is employed by both us and EchoStar. In addition, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction discussed in\nNote 20 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we own shares of a series of preferred tracking stock issued by EchoStar and shares of a series of preferred tracking stock issued by Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (\u201cHSSC\u201d), a subsidiary of EchoStar (collectively, the \u201cTracking Stock\u201d). The Tracking Stock generally tracks the residential retail satellite broadband business of Hughes Network Systems, LLC (\u201cHNS\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSSC, including without limitation the operations, assets and liabilities attributed to the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business (collectively, the \u201cHughes Retail Group\u201d). The shares of the Tracking Stock issued to us represent an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group. Although our investment in the Tracking Stock represents an aggregate 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group, we have no operational control or significant influence over the Hughes Retail Group business, and currently there is no public market for the Tracking Stock. Further, Effective July 1, 2012, we and EchoStar formed Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (\u201cSling TV,\u201d formerly known as DISH Digital Holding L.L.C.), which was owned two-thirds by us and one-third by EchoStar. Sling TV was formed to develop and commercialize certain advanced technologies. Effective August 1, 2014, EchoStar and Sling TV entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Sling TV distributed certain assets to EchoStar and EchoStar reduced its interest in Sling TV to a ten percent non-voting interest. We now have a ninety percent equity interest and a 100% voting interest in Sling TV. On February 9, 2015, we launched a live, OTT service under the Sling TV brand. See Note 20 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u00b7 Intercompany agreements with EchoStar. In connection with and following the Spin-off, we and EchoStar have entered into certain agreements pursuant to which we obtain certain products, services and rights from EchoStar, EchoStar obtains certain products, services and rights from us, and we and EchoStar have indemnified each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses. See Note 20 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar. The terms of certain of these agreements were established while EchoStar was a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and were not the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations. The allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between EchoStar and us under the separation and other intercompany agreements we entered into with EchoStar, in connection with the Spin-off, may have been different if agreed to by two unaffiliated parties. Had these agreements been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties, their terms may have been more favorable, or less favorable, to us. In addition, conflicts could arise between us and EchoStar in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of these existing agreements.\n\u00b7 Additional intercompany transactions. EchoStar and its subsidiaries have and will continue to enter into transactions with us and our subsidiaries. Although the terms of any such transactions will be established based upon negotiations between EchoStar and us and, when appropriate, subject to the approval of a committee of the non-interlocking directors or in certain instances non-interlocking management, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries or affiliates as may otherwise be obtained between unaffiliated parties.\n\u00b7 Business opportunities. We have historically retained, and in the future may acquire, interests in various companies that have subsidiaries or controlled affiliates that own or operate domestic or foreign services that may compete with services offered by EchoStar. We may also compete with EchoStar when we participate in auctions for spectrum or orbital slots for our satellites. In addition, EchoStar may in the future use its satellites, uplink and transmission assets to compete directly against us in the subscription television business.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nOther than certain arrangements with EchoStar that we entered into in connection with Sling TV, which, subject to certain exceptions, limits EchoStar\u2019s and our ability to operate an IPTV service other than operated by Sling TV, we do not have agreements with EchoStar that would prevent either company from competing with the other.\nWe rely on key personnel and the loss of their services may negatively affect our businesses.\nWe believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the performance of Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and certain other executives. The loss of Mr. Ergen or of certain other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although all of our executives have executed agreements limiting their ability to work for or consult with competitors if they leave us, we do not have employment agreements with any of them. To the extent our officers are performing services for EchoStar, this may divert their time and attention away from our business and may therefore adversely affect our business.\nAcquisition and Capital Structure Risks Affecting our Business\nWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to the AWS-3 Auction.\nDISH Spectrum\nWe have invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets.\n700 MHz Licenses. In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless spectrum licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009. At the time they were granted, these licenses were subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. By June 2013, we were required to provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 35% of the geographic area in each area covered by each individual license (the \u201c700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). By June 2019, we were required to provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 70% of the geographic area in each area covered by each individual license (the \u201c700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). As discussed below, these requirements have since been modified by the FCC.\nOn September 9, 2013, we filed a letter with the FCC in support of a voluntary industry solution to resolve certain interoperability issues affecting the lower 700 MHz spectrum band (the \u201cInteroperability Solution\u201d). On October 29, 2013, the FCC issued an order approving the Interoperability Solution (the \u201cInteroperability Solution Order\u201d), which requires us to reduce power emissions on our 700 MHz licenses. As part of the Interoperability Solution Order, the FCC, among other things, approved our request to modify the 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement so that by March 2017, we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of our total E Block population (the \u201cModified 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). The FCC also approved our request to modify the 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement so that by March 2021, we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 70% of the population in each of our E Block license areas (the \u201cModified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). These requirements replaced the previous build-out requirements associated with our 700 MHz licenses. While the modifications to our 700 MHz licenses provide us additional time to complete the build-out requirements, the reduction in power emissions could have an adverse impact on our ability to fully utilize our 700 MHz licenses. If we fail to meet the Modified 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement, the Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by one year, from March 2021 to March 2020, and we could face the reduction of license area(s). If we fail to meet the Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement, our authorization may terminate for the geographic portion of each license in which we are not providing service.\nAWS-4 Licenses. On March 2, 2012, the FCC approved the transfer of 40 MHz of wireless spectrum licenses held by DBSD North America and TerreStar to us. On March 9, 2012, we completed the DBSD Transaction and the TerreStar Transaction, pursuant to which we acquired, among other things, certain satellite assets and wireless spectrum licenses held by DBSD North America and TerreStar. The total consideration to acquire the DBSD North America and TerreStar assets was approximately $2.860 billion.\nOur consolidated FCC applications for approval of the license transfers from DBSD North America and TerreStar were accompanied by requests for waiver of the FCC\u2019s MSS \u201cintegrated service\u201d and spare satellite requirements and various technical provisions. On March 21, 2012, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making proposing the elimination of the integrated service, spare satellite and various technical requirements associated with these licenses. On December 11, 2012, the FCC approved rules that eliminated these requirements and gave notice\nof its proposed modification of our authorizations to, among other things, allow us to offer single-mode terrestrial terminals to customers who do not desire satellite functionality. On February 15, 2013, the FCC issued an order, which became effective on March 7, 2013, modifying our licenses to expand our terrestrial operating authority with AWS-4 authority. That order imposed certain limitations on the use of a portion of this spectrum, including interference protections for other spectrum users and power and emission limits that we presently believe could render 5 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2000-2005 MHz) effectively unusable for terrestrial services and limit our ability to fully utilize the remaining 15 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2005-2020 MHz) for terrestrial services. These limitations could, among other things, impact the ongoing development of technical standards associated with our wireless business, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our AWS-4 licenses. That order also mandated certain interim and final build-out requirements for the licenses. By March 2017, we must provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least 40% of the aggregate population represented by all of the areas covered by the licenses (the \u201cAWS-4 Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). By March 2020, we were required to provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least 70% of the population in each area covered by an individual license (the \u201cAWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d).\nOn December 20, 2013, the FCC issued a further order that, among other things, extended the AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement by one year to March 2021 (the \u201cModified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). If we fail to meet the AWS-4 Interim Build-Out Requirement, the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by one year, from March 2021 to March 2020. If we fail to meet the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement, our terrestrial authorization for each license area in which we fail to meet the requirement may terminate. The FCC\u2019s December 20, 2013 order also conditionally waived certain FCC rules for our AWS-4 licenses to allow us to repurpose all 20 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2000-2020 MHz) for downlink (the \u201cAWS-4 Downlink Waiver\u201d). If we fail to notify the FCC that we intend to use our uplink spectrum for downlink by June 20, 2016, the AWS-4 Downlink Waiver will terminate, and the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement will revert back to the AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement.\nH Block Licenses. The auction of wireless spectrum known as the H Block commenced on January 22, 2014 and concluded on February 27, 2014. We were the winning bidder for all 176 wireless spectrum licenses in the H Block auction with an aggregate bid of $1.564 billion. On December 17, 2013, we paid approximately $328 million to the FCC as a deposit for the H Block auction. We paid the remaining balance of our winning bid of approximately $1.236 billion for the H Block licenses on March 28, 2014. On April 29, 2014, the FCC issued an order granting our application to acquire these H Block licenses. As a result, during May 2014, we also paid approximately $13 million to UTAM, Inc. for clearance costs associated with the lower H Block spectrum and approximately $95 million to Sprint for clearance costs associated with the upper H Block spectrum in connection with the issuance of the H Block licenses. The H Block licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. By April 2018, we must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of the population in each area covered by an individual H Block license (the \u201cH Block Interim Build-Out Requirement\u201d). By April 2024, we must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 75% of the population in each area covered by an individual H Block license (the \u201cH Block Final Build-Out Requirement\u201d). If we fail to meet the H Block Interim Build-Out Requirement, the H Block license term and the H Block Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by two years (from April 2024 to April 2022) for each H Block license area in which we fail to meet the requirement. If we fail to meet the H Block Final Build-Out Requirement, our authorization for each H Block license area in which we fail to meet the requirement may terminate. The FCC has adopted rules for the H Block spectrum band that is adjacent to our AWS-4 licenses. Depending on the outcome of the standard-setting process for the H Block and our ultimate decision regarding the AWS-4 Downlink Waiver, the rules that the FCC adopted for the H Block could further impact 15 MHz of our AWS-4 uplink spectrum (2005-2020 MHz), which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the AWS-4 licenses.\nCommercialization of Our Wireless Spectrum Licenses and Related Assets. We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund these\nefforts, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying value of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations.\nAWS-3 Auction\nThe AWS-3 Auction commenced on November 13, 2014 and concluded on January 29, 2015. The FCC\u2019s prohibition on certain communications related to the AWS-3 Auction expired on February 13, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless each filed applications with the FCC to acquire certain AWS-3 Licenses for which it was named as winning bidder and had made the required down payments. Each of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless has applied as a Designated Entity that is entitled to receive a bidding credit of 25% in the AWS-3 Auction, as defined by FCC regulations.\nNorthstar Wireless was the winning bidder for the Northstar Licenses with gross winning bids totaling approximately $7.845 billion, which after taking into account a 25% bidding credit, equals net winning bids totaling approximately $5.884 billion. Northstar Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northstar Spectrum. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, American II, we own an 85% non-controlling interest in Northstar Spectrum. Northstar Manager owns a 15% controlling interest in, and is the sole manager of, Northstar Spectrum. Northstar Spectrum is governed by the Northstar Spectrum LLC Agreement by and between American II and Northstar Manager. Pursuant to the Northstar Spectrum LLC Agreement, American II and Northstar Manager agreed to make pro-rata equity contributions in Northstar Spectrum equal to approximately 15% of the net purchase price of the Northstar Licenses. American II also entered into the Northstar Credit Agreement by and among American II, as Lender, Northstar Wireless, as Borrower, and Northstar Spectrum, as Guarantor. Pursuant to the Northstar Credit Agreement, American II agreed to make loans to Northstar Wireless for approximately 85% of the net purchase price of the Northstar Licenses. American II made equity contributions to Northstar Spectrum of approximately $633 million and a loan to Northstar Wireless of approximately $432 million for Northstar Wireless to make the upfront payment for the AWS-3 Auction and the down payment required for the Northstar Licenses. American II is also required to make an equity contribution to Northstar Spectrum of approximately $117 million and a loan to Northstar Wireless of approximately $4.569 billion for Northstar Wireless to make the final payment required for the Northstar Licenses, which is due to the FCC by March 2, 2015. Consequently, as of March 2, 2015, the total equity contributions from American II to Northstar Spectrum will be approximately $750 million and the total loans from American II to Northstar Wireless will be approximately $5.001 billion.\nSNR Wireless was the winning bidder for the SNR Licenses with gross winning bids totaling approximately $5.482 billion, which after taking into account a 25% bidding credit, equals net winning bids totaling approximately $4.112 billion. In addition to the net winning bids, SNR Wireless is obligated to make a bid withdrawal payment of approximately $8 million to the FCC. SNR Wireless is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SNR Holdco. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, American III, we own an 85% non-controlling interest in SNR Holdco. SNR Management owns a 15% controlling interest in, and is the sole manager of, SNR Holdco. SNR Holdco is governed by the SNR Holdco LLC Agreement by and between American III and SNR Management. Pursuant to the SNR Holdco LLC Agreement, American III and SNR Management agreed to make pro-rata equity contributions in SNR Holdco equal to approximately 15% of the net purchase price of the SNR Licenses. American III also entered into the SNR Credit Agreement by and among American III, as Lender, SNR Wireless, as Borrower, and SNR Holdco, as Guarantor. Pursuant to the SNR Credit Agreement, American III agreed to make loans to SNR Wireless for the amount of the bid withdrawal payment and approximately 85% of the net purchase price of the SNR Licenses. American III made equity contributions to SNR Holdco of approximately $408 million and a loan to SNR Wireless of approximately $350 million for SNR Wireless to make the upfront payment for the AWS-3 Auction and the down payment required for the SNR Licenses. American III is also required to make an equity contribution to SNR Holdco of approximately $116 million and a loan to SNR Wireless of approximately $3.153 billion for SNR Wireless to make the final payment required for the SNR Licenses, which is due to the FCC by March 2, 2015. Consequently, as of March 2, 2015, the total equity contributions from American III to SNR Holdco will be approximately $524 million and the total loans from American III to SNR Wireless will be approximately $3.503 billion.\nAfter Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless have made the final payments to the FCC for the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, respectively, our total non-controlling equity and debt investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities will be approximately $9.778 billion. We have funded and will fund these investments from existing cash and marketable investment securities. Such funding has included and will include $899 million in total equity and debt investments in the Northstar Entities and SNR Entities during the fourth quarter 2014, cash and marketable investment securities as of December 31, 2014, cash generated from operations during 2015, and a $400 million refund from the FCC to one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries related to the AWS-3 Auction. Issuance of any AWS-3 Licenses to Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless depends, among other things, upon the FCC\u2019s review and approval of the applications filed by Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless. Objections to the applications filed by Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless must be submitted to the FCC within ten calendar days following the release by the FCC of the public notice listing the applications acceptable for filing. We cannot predict the timing or the outcome of the FCC\u2019s review of the applications filed by Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless.\nIn the event that the FCC grants the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, we may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities.\nWe have used a substantial portion of our existing cash and marketable investment securities to fund our non-controlling debt and equity investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. As a result of, among other things, these non-controlling investments, we may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, economic weakness or weak results of operations may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund these non-controlling debt and equity investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions, as well as to fund ongoing operations and service our debt. As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities. See \u201cWe face certain risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d below for more information.\nImpairment of Assets\nFurthermore, the fair values of wireless spectrum licenses and related assets may vary significantly in the future. In particular, valuation swings could occur if:\n\u00b7 consolidation in the wireless industry allows or requires wireless carriers to sell significant portions of their wireless spectrum holdings, which could in turn reduce the value of our spectrum holdings;\n\u00b7 a sale of spectrum by one or more wireless providers occurs;\n\u00b7 the FCC pursues certain policies designed to increase the number of wireless spectrum licenses available in each of our markets; or\n\u00b7 the FCC conducts additional wireless spectrum auctions.\nIf the fair value of our wireless spectrum licenses were to decline significantly, the value of these licenses could be subject to impairment charges. We assess potential impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more often if indicators of impairment arise to determine whether there is evidence that indicate an impairment condition may exist.\nBased on the FCC\u2019s rules applicable to our AWS-4 authorizations no longer requiring an integrated satellite component or ground spare and on our evaluation of the satellite capacity needed for our wireless segment, among other things, during the second quarter 2013, we concluded that T2 and D1 represented excess satellite capacity for the potential commercialization of our wireless spectrum. During the fourth quarter 2014, EchoStar purchased our rights to the T2 satellite. While we are no longer required to operate an integrated satellite component, we are currently planning on using T1 and D1 in the commercialization of our wireless spectrum or for other commercial purposes. If T1 is not used in the commercialization of our wireless spectrum or for other commercial purposes, we may need to impair it in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations. If D1 is not used in the commercialization of our wireless spectrum or for other commercial purposes, we may need to further impair it in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations.\nTo the extent that we commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses, we will face certain risks entering and competing in the wireless services industry and operating a wireless services business.\nWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund these efforts, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying value of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations.\nTo the extent we commercialize our wireless spectrum licenses and enter the wireless services industry, a wireless services business presents certain risks. Any of the following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00b7 The wireless services industry is competitive and maturing. We have limited experience in the wireless services industry, which is a competitive and maturing industry with incumbent and established competitors such as Verizon, AT&T, Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d) and T-Mobile USA Inc. (\u201cT-Mobile\u201d). These companies have substantial market share and have more wireless spectrum assets than us. Some of these companies have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us, and have existing cost and operational advantages that we lack. Market saturation is expected to continue to cause the wireless services industry\u2019s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison to historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. As the industry matures, competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other\u2019s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of wireless services. Furthermore, the cost of attracting a new customer is generally higher than the cost associated with retaining an existing customer. In addition, we may face increasing competition from wireless telecommunications providers who offer mobile video offerings. Wireless mobile video offerings will likely become more prevalent in the marketplace as wireless telecommunications providers implement and expand the fourth generation of wireless communications. During May 2014, AT&T announced its pending acquisition of DirecTV, which is currently undergoing regulatory review and has not been completed. We filed a petition to impose conditions on the transaction with the FCC, to remedy potential threats to consumers and competition in the video and broadband markets. If DirecTV ultimately is acquired by AT&T, DirecTV will, among other things, have increased access to capital, access to AT&T\u2019s nationwide platform for wireless mobile video, and the ability to more seamlessly bundle its video services with AT&T\u2019s broadband Internet access and voice services. The combined company would also be able to, among other things, pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; utilize its increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price it pays for programming at the expense of other MVPDs, including us; thwart our entry into the wireless market, by, among other things, refusing to enter into data roaming agreements with us; foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; and impose anti-competitive data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings.\n\u00b7 Our ability to compete effectively would be dependent on a number of factors. Our ability to compete effectively would depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage; the pricing of our products and services; the quality of customer service; our development of new and enhanced products and services; the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels; and capital resources. It would also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including, among others, new technologies and business models, products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in consumer preferences, the demand for services, demographic trends, economic conditions, and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by competitors. It may be difficult for us to differentiate our products and services from other competitors in the industry, which may limit our ability to attract customers. Our success also may depend on our ability to access and deploy adequate spectrum, deploy new technologies and offer attractive services to customers. For example, we may not be able to obtain and offer certain technologies or features that are subject to competitor patents or other exclusive arrangements.\n\u00b7 We would depend on third parties to provide us with infrastructure and products and services. We would depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with infrastructure, equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment that we would need in order to operate a wireless services business and provide products and services to our customers. For example, handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. If these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or services on a timely basis or fail to meet performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when expected by our customers. Any difficulties experienced with these suppliers and vendors could result in additional expense and/or delays in introducing our wireless services. Our efforts would involve significant expense and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and management, and service offerings. In addition, these suppliers and vendors may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we would depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement, which claims have been growing rapidly in the wireless services industry.\n\u00b7 Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to government regulation. Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities. These governmental authorities could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, other federal and international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal or revocation. There can be no assurances that our wireless spectrum licenses will be renewed. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. For further information related to our wireless spectrum licenses, including build-out requirements, see other Risk Factors above.\nWe face certain risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the risks described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors - We have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to the AWS-3 Auction\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we face certain other risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, including, among others, the risks described below. Any of the following risks, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not own or control the Northstar Licenses or the SNR Licenses nor do we control the Northstar Entities or the SNR Entities. We do not have, a right to require Northstar Manager or SNR Management to sell their respective ownership interests in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco to us. Northstar Manager, as the sole manager of Northstar Spectrum, and SNR Management, as the sole manager of SNR Holdco, will have the exclusive right and power to manage, operate and control Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco, respectively, subject to certain limited protective provisions for the benefit of American II and American III, respectively. Northstar Manager and SNR Management will have the ability, but not the obligation, to require Northstar Spectrum and SNR Holdco, respectively, to purchase Northstar Manager\u2019s and SNR Management\u2019s ownership interests in those respective entities after the fifth anniversary of the grant date of the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Thus, we cannot be certain that the Northstar Licenses or the SNR Licenses will be developed in a manner fully consistent with our current or future business plans.\nThe FCC has implemented rules and policies governing the designated entity program that are intended to ensure that qualifying designated entities are not controlled by operators or investors that do not meet certain qualification tests. For example, designated entity structures are subject, among other things, to a requirement that they seek approval for any event that might affect their ongoing eligibility (e.g., changes in agreements that the FCC has previously reviewed), annual reporting requirements, and a commitment by the FCC to audit each designated entity at least once during the license term. In addition, \u201ccontrol,\u201d for purposes of the FCC regulations, includes call rights so that operators or investors that do not meet the small business qualification tests may not hold an option or right to acquire a controlling interest in a designated entity. Qualification is also subject to challenge in qui tam lawsuits filed by private parties alleging that participants have defrauded the government in which the person bringing the suit may share in any recovery by the government. In addition, the FCC may require that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities modify their respective agreements in order for Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless to confirm their respective qualifications as Designated Entities. In the event that Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless fail to comply with the FCC\u2019s designated entity rules, any such failure could lead to fines; reimbursement of the 25% bidding credits plus interest; and in certain cases, license revocation, third-party lawsuits and/or criminal penalties. Furthermore, litigation surrounding designated entity structures, increased regulatory scrutiny or third party or government lawsuits with respect to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the event that the FCC grants the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, we may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities.\nWe have used a substantial portion of our existing cash and marketable investment securities to fund our non-controlling debt and equity investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. As a result of, among other things, these non-controlling investments, we may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, economic weakness or weak results of operations may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund these non-controlling debt and equity investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions, as well as to fund ongoing operations and service our debt. As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our businesses that may not be successful and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions.\nOur future success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. To pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex. We may not be able to identify or\ncomplete attractive acquisition or investment opportunities due to, among other things, the intense competition for these transactions. If we are not able to identify and complete such acquisition or investment opportunities, our future results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain in the anticipated timeframe, or at all, any regulatory approvals required to complete proposed acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Furthermore, the conditions imposed for obtaining any necessary approvals could delay the completion of such transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. We may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;\n\u00b7 possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u00b7 a high degree of risk inherent in these transactions, which could become substantial over time, and higher exposure to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful;\n\u00b7 our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction; and\n\u00b7 the risks associated with complying with regulations applicable to the acquired business, which may cause us to incur substantial expenses.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, the integration process may strain our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures.\nNew acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing businesses. To pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition to committing capital to complete the acquisitions, substantial capital may be required to operate the acquired businesses following their acquisition. These acquisitions may result in significant financial losses if the intended objectives of the transactions are not achieved. Some of the businesses acquired by us have experienced significant operating and financial challenges in their recent history, which in some cases resulted in these businesses commencing bankruptcy proceedings prior to our acquisition. We may acquire similar businesses in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully address the challenges and risks encountered by these businesses following their acquisition. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges and risks, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations may suffer.\nWe may need additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to continue investing in our businesses and to finance acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nWe may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, to among other things, continue investing in our businesses, construct and launch new satellites, and to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions. Weakness in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. In addition, economic weakness or weak results of operations may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other strategic transactions, as well as to fund ongoing operations and service our debt. As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.\nSee \u201cWe have made substantial investments to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and other related assets. In addition, we have made substantial non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to the AWS-3 Auction\u201d above for more information.\nFrom time to time a portion of our investment portfolio may be invested in securities that have limited liquidity and may not be immediately accessible to support our financing needs, including investments in public companies that are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility.\nFrom time to time a portion of our investment portfolio may be invested in strategic investments, and as a result, a portion of our portfolio may have restricted liquidity. If the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or there is a lack of liquidity in the marketplace, we may be required to record impairment charges. Moreover, the uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets can greatly affect the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, a portion of our investment portfolio may include strategic and financial investments in debt and equity securities of public companies that are highly speculative and experience volatility. Typically, these investments are concentrated in a small number of companies. The fair value of these investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. The concentration of these investments as a percentage of our overall investment portfolio fluctuates from time to time based on, among other things, the size of our investment portfolio and our ability to liquidate these investments. In addition, because our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of companies, we may experience a significant loss if any of these companies, among other things, defaults on its obligations, performs poorly, does not generate adequate cash flow to fund its operations, is unable to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, or at all, or files for bankruptcy, or if the sectors in which these companies operate experience a market downturn. To the extent we require access to funds, we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions, record impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs.\nWe have substantial debt outstanding and may incur additional debt.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total debt, including the debt of our subsidiaries, was $14.464 billion. Our debt levels could have significant consequences, including:\n\u00b7 requiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes. As a result, we would have limited financial and operating flexibility in responding to changing economic and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to raise additional debt because it may be more difficult for us to obtain debt financing on attractive terms; and\n\u00b7 placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures relating to our senior notes permit us to incur additional debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks we now face could intensify.\nIt may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders, because of our ownership structure.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7 a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A that entitles the holders to one vote per share, a Class B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Class C that entitles the holders to one vote per share, except upon a change in control of our company in which case the holders of Class C are entitled to ten votes per share;\n\u00b7 a provision that authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 a provision limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u00b7 a provision establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nIn addition, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation we have a significant amount of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nWe are controlled by one principal stockholder who is also our Chairman.\nCharles W. Ergen, our Chairman, owns approximately 46.8% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially owns approximately 49.5% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by Mr. Ergen into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, Mr. Ergen controls approximately 81.9% of the total voting power. Mr. Ergen\u2019s beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock excludes 25,188,204 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock currently held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. These trusts own approximately 5.5% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of all Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock) and beneficially own approximately 10.1% of our total equity securities (assuming conversion of only the Class B Common Stock held by such trusts into Class A Common Stock). Under either a beneficial or equity calculation method, these trusts possess approximately 9.7% of the total voting power. Through his voting power, Mr. Ergen has the ability to elect a majority of our directors and to control all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. As a result, DISH Network is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the Nasdaq listing rules and is, therefore, not subject to Nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Mr. Ergen is also the principal stockholder and Chairman of EchoStar.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Affecting our Business\nOur business depends on certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other parties, to use our technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted, which could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to compete effectively or could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. We currently have pending lawsuits with two major broadcast television networks alleging, among other things, that the PrimeTime Anytime\u2122 and AutoHop\u2122 features of the Hopper\u00ae set-top box infringe their copyrights. Additionally, Fox has alleged, among other things, that the Slingbox \u201cplaceshifting\u201d functionality and Hopper Transfers\u2122 features of our Hopper set-top box infringe its copyrights. See Note 16 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. In the event a court ultimately determines that we infringe the asserted copyrights, we may be subject to, among other things, an injunction that could require us to materially modify or cease to offer these features. Moreover, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we rely on technologies developed or\nlicensed by third parties, and if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we work with third parties such as vendors, contractors and suppliers for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products and services, and our products and services may contain technologies provided to us by these third parties or other third parties. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether any such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of others. Our vendors, contractors and suppliers may not be required to indemnify us if a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. Legal challenges to these intellectual property rights may impair our ability to use the products, services and technologies that we need in order to operate our business and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are party to various lawsuits which, if adversely decided, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, particularly lawsuits regarding intellectual property.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, including among other things, disputes with programmers regarding fees. Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that may cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringes on intellectual property held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the intellectual property. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Please see further discussion under \u201cItem 1. Business - Patents and Other Intellectual Property\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our services or the products used in connection with our services may potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever arises first). Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which our services or the products used in connection with our services may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications. Further, it is often not possible to determine definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid.\nOur ability to distribute video content via the Internet, including our OTT services, involves regulatory risk.\nAs a result of recent updates to certain of our programming agreements which allow us to, among other things, deliver certain authenticated content via the Internet and/or through our OTT services, we are increasingly distributing video content to our subscribers via the Internet and through our OTT services. The ability to continue this strategy may depend in part on the FCC\u2019s success in implementing rules prohibiting blocking and discrimination against our distribution of content over broadband networks. For more information, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulations - FCC Regulations Governing our DBS Operations - Net Neutrality\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in the Cable Act, and/or the rules of the FCC that implement the Cable Act, may limit our ability to access programming from cable-affiliated programmers at nondiscriminatory rates.\nWe purchase a large percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. Pursuant to the Cable Act, cable providers had been prohibited from entering into exclusive contracts with cable-affiliated programmers. The Cable Act directed that this prohibition expire after a certain period of time unless the FCC determined that the prohibition continued to be necessary. On October 5, 2012, the FCC allowed this prohibition to expire. While the FCC has issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking aimed at serving some of the same objectives as the prohibition, there can be no assurances that such protections will be adopted or be as effective as the prohibition if they are adopted. In the event this decision is reconsidered by the FCC or reviewed by a court of appeals, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any subsequent FCC decision.\nAs a result of the expiration of this prohibition on exclusivity, we may be limited in our ability to obtain access at all, or on nondiscriminatory terms, to programming from programmers that are affiliated with cable system operators. In addition, any other changes in the Cable Act, and/or the FCC\u2019s rules that implement the Cable Act, that currently limit the ability of cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing businesses such as ours, could adversely affect our ability to acquire cable-affiliated programming at all or to acquire programming on nondiscriminatory terms.\nFurthermore, the FCC had imposed program access conditions on certain cable companies as a result of mergers, consolidations or affiliations with programmers. The expiration of the exclusivity prohibition in the Cable Act triggered the termination of certain program access conditions that the FCC had imposed on Liberty. In July 2012, similar program access conditions that had applied to Time Warner Cable expired as previously scheduled. These developments may adversely affect our ability to obtain Liberty\u2019s and Time Warner Cable\u2019s programming, or to obtain it on nondiscriminatory terms. In the case of certain types of programming affiliated with Comcast through its control of NBCUniversal, the prohibition on exclusivity will still apply until January 2018. During that time, we have the right to subject the terms of access to NBCUniversal\u2019s programming to binding arbitration if we and the programmer cannot reach agreement on terms, subject to FCC review. There can be no assurance that this procedure will result in favorable terms for us or that the FCC conditions that establish this procedure will be prevented from expiring on their own terms.\nIn addition, affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming they feed to their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. The FCC has held that new denials of such service are unfair if they have the purpose or effect of significantly hindering us from providing programming to consumers. However, we cannot be sure that we can prevail in a complaint related to such programming and gain access to it. Our continuing failure to access such programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these cable providers.\nThe injunction against our retransmission of distant networks, which is currently waived, may be reinstated.\nPursuant to STELA, we obtained a waiver of a court injunction that previously prevented us from retransmitting certain distant network signals under a statutory copyright license. Because of that waiver, we may provide distant network signals to eligible subscribers. To qualify for that waiver, we are required to provide local service in all 210 local markets in the U.S. on an ongoing basis. This condition poses a significant strain on our capacity. Moreover, we may lose that waiver if we are found to have failed to provide local service in any of the 210 local markets. If we lose the waiver, the injunction could be reinstated. Furthermore, depending on the severity of the failure, we may also be subject to other sanctions, which may include, among other things, damages.\nWe are subject to significant regulatory oversight, and changes in applicable regulatory requirements, including any adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations, particularly our DBS operations and our wireless spectrum licenses, are subject to significant government regulation and oversight, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and foreign, state and local authorities. Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in the limitations on, or suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to video programming, satellite services, wireless telecommunications, broadband, the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. If we become subject to new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation that govern Internet network neutrality, for example, we may be required to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. The manner in which legislation governing Internet network neutrality may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should review the regulatory disclosures under the caption \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur business depends on FCC licenses that can expire or be revoked or modified and applications for FCC licenses that may not be granted.\nIf the FCC were to cancel, revoke, suspend, restrict, significantly condition, or fail to renew any of our licenses or authorizations, or fail to grant our applications for FCC licenses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, loss of a frequency authorization would reduce the amount of spectrum available to us, potentially reducing the amount of services available to our subscribers. The materiality of such a loss of authorizations would vary based upon, among other things, the location of the frequency used or the availability of replacement spectrum. In addition, Congress often considers and enacts legislation that affects us and FCC proceedings to implement the Communications Act and enforce its regulations are ongoing. We cannot predict the outcomes of these legislative or regulatory proceedings or their effect on our business.\nWe are subject to digital HD \u201ccarry-one, carry-all\u201d requirements that cause capacity constraints.\nTo provide any full-power local broadcast signal in any market, we are required to retransmit all qualifying broadcast signals in that market (\u201ccarry-one, carry-all\u201d). The FCC adopted digital carriage rules that required DBS providers to phase in carry-one, carry-all obligations with respect to the carriage of full-power broadcasters\u2019 HD signals by February 17, 2013 in markets in which they elect to provide local channels in HD. We have met this requirement in all applicable markets. In addition, STELA has imposed accelerated HD carriage requirements for noncommercial educational stations on DBS providers that do not have a certain contractual relationship with a certain number of such stations. We have entered into such contractual relationships with the requisite number of PBS stations to comply with the requirements. The carriage of additional HD signals on our pay-TV service could cause us to experience significant capacity constraints and prevent us from carrying additional popular national programs and/or carrying those national programs in HD. In addition, there is a pending rulemaking before the FCC regarding whether to require DBS providers to carry all broadcast stations in a local market in both standard definition and HD if they carry any station in that market in both standard definition and HD. If we were required to carry multiple versions of each broadcast station, we would have to dedicate more of our finite satellite capacity to each broadcast station. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this rulemaking process.\nOur business, investor confidence in our financial results and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.\nWe periodically evaluate and test our internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. If in the future we are unable to report that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our auditors do not agree with our assessment of the effectiveness of, or are unable to express an opinion on, our internal control over financial reporting), investors, customers and business partners could lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\nWe may face other risks described from time to time in periodic and current reports we file with the SEC.", "PERMNO": 81696, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "DISH"}
