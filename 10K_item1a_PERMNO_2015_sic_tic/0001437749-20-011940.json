RISK FACTORS\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has adversely affected our business activities, financial condition and results of operations and may continue to do so.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and the resulting \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions and other precautions have caused severe disruptions in the United States economy, which have disrupted our business and may continue to do so. These restrictions and measures and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees have affected our business and operations by, among other things, causing temporary facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; requiring modifications to our business processes; delaying the receipt of customer orders; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; and increasing the risk that supply chains may be disrupted. These impacts have caused and may continue to cause delays in product shipments, decreases in revenue, profitability and cash from operations, which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our results of operations that may be material. The potential duration and impact of the outbreak on the United State economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty.\nWe have significant working capital requirements and have experienced operating losses. If we continue to experience operating losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon obtaining revenues from sales of our products and raising additional capital from investors to meet our working capital needs. Since 2011, we have relied on a series of private placements and loans to fund our operating cash flow deficits. There is no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or positive net operating cash flows to meet our working capital requirements and pay our debts as they become due in the future due.\nWe incurred net losses of $687,000 in fiscal 2020, and $937,000 in fiscal 2019. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $30.6 million as of March 28, 2020. Through March 28, 2020, we have incurred expenditures of approximately $24.0 million for the development and marketing of our RADAR/EW system product platform. Although we have shipped RADAR/EW system products to several customers, potential delays in the development of additional product features and upgrades, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses and reduced liquidity.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our current operations and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited. The lack of adequate working capital from any inability to generate positive net cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue, delay or suspend R&D, product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. As a result, we may also be required to further reduce expenses if our RADAR/EW product platform sales goals are not achieved and could, for example, choose to focus solely on our Microsource business segment, which we expect to be more profitable than our Giga-tronics business segment, to generate revenue and cash from operating activities. As part of such a restructuring, management believes the microwave components which the Company developed for the RADAR/EW test systems in the Giga-tronics business segment could be a source of growth for the Microsource business segment.\nWe may require additional capital to support our current operations and this capital may not been readily available.\nTo bring the RADAR/EW product platform to its full potential, we may need to seek additional working capital; however, there are no assurances that such working capital will be available, or on terms acceptable to us. To the extent we satisfy our working capital needs by issuing additional equity securities, we will cause a dilution for our common stock. To the extent we satisfy our working capital needs by incurring additional debt, our operating cash flow may suffer in order to satisfy debt service obligations. Our recent history of losses, changes to our product focus and the development of new products makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies developing new products as we have, in fact, encountered. In particular, there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u25cf\nimplement or execute our current business plan, which may or may not be sound;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully and timely sell, manufacture and ship our products;\n\u25cf\nmaintain our anticipated management; and\n\u25cf\nraise sufficient funds in the capital markets to carry out our business plan.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.\nFurthermore, we cannot assure you that any necessary financing, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nThe timing of our revenues is difficult to predict. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry and a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts and our ability to timely develop, produce and upgrade our products.\nMost of our revenues result from a limited number of relatively large orders that we receive from prime defense contractors and governmental agencies. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our products are frequently subject to budget constraints (including constraints imposed by governmental agencies), multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Even if we receive a purchase order from a customer, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular fiscal period in which a sale will be completed or the fiscal period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. For these reasons, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Such unpredictable operating results may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers.\nAll of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace, which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, our sales may be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in revenues. As a result, our business depends upon continued U.S. government expenditures on defense for which we provide support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time and have been reduced in some periods. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially harmed, among other causes, by the following:\n\u25cf\nbudgetary constraints, including mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting across-the-board government spending, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding;\n\u25cf\na shift in expenditures away from defense programs that we support;\n\u25cf\nefforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting government programs;\n\u25cf\nU.S. government shutdowns due to, among other reasons, a failure by elected officials to fund the government and other potential delays in the appropriations process;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities.\nAdditionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nIf our reputation or relationships with the U.S. federal government or the limited number of defense contractors with whom we work were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the U.S. federal government, its agencies and several defense contractors that supply them. Approximately $21 million or 91% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 were derived from contracts with the U.S. federal government and its agencies, either directly or through defense contractors with whom with have contracted. Our reputation and relationships with various U.S. government entities and agencies, in particular with the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Navy, and the limited number of defense contractors serving these agencies, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues and winning bids for new business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation or relationships with government agencies were to be negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in delays of sales or shipments or our liability for penalties, including termination of our government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future government contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting.\nWe must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. If we experience difficulty or are unable to comply with these requirements, we could face delays in the receipt of orders, production of products and performance of services and sales, or the loss of any of these.\nSome U.S. federal statutes and regulations provide for penalties, including automatic debarment based on actions such as violations of the U.S. False Claims Act or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to a facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire Company in severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with governments and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards.\nThe market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved performance capabilities, and to continue to upgrade or enhance our existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development or enhancement of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market sufficient market acceptance. The inability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner and to achieve sustained commercial market acceptance could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity.\nPerformance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors\u2019 products may harm our business and reputation.\nProducts as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that one of our products might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally.\nOur RADAR/EW testing system products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur RADAR/EW testing system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems following its sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel\u2019s attention from our product development and sales efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.\nOur products contain components produced by suppliers which may be discontinued, subject to supply constraints or no longer available in future periods, which could require that we redesign product components, lead to production delays and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain components produced by our suppliers may be discontinued, subject to supply constraints or no longer available to us to produce our products. Such discontinuations or lack of supply could require us to seek replacement components that may take longer and cost more than initially expected to procure, redesign our products for different components and/or delay production of our production unless supplies become available, any of which could lead to delays in product sales.\nIf we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with quality certifications and classified processing, cybersecurity and control standards, product deliveries may be delayed or cancelled which would adversely impact our business, operating result and financial condition.\nCertain of our customer contracts require that we maintain quality certifications and classified processing, cybersecurity and control standards. If we were unable to maintain such certifications and standards, our product shipments may be delayed or cancelled which would cause us to lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services to customers.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and if our products or the functionality of our products overlap with patents of our competitors. While we do not currently believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful, even if such claims are meritless. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. We may not prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation results in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;\n\u25cf\ncease manufacture, use or sale of infringing products;\n\u25cf\ndiscontinue the use of infringing technology;\n\u25cf\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages to our customers or end-users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;\n\u25cf\nlicense technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or\n\u25cf\nrelinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable.\nWe face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and high selling price of our RADAR/EW testing platform.\nOur RADAR/EW testing platform has been our primary product development focus during the past eight years, however, delays in completing its initial development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased our accumulated deficit as of March 28, 2020. Additionally, the average selling price of our RADAR/EW system is considerably higher than our prior general-purpose test and measurement products, which in turn requires additional internal approvals on the part of the customer and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and liquidity.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our competitive position may suffer.\nOur business plan is predicated on our proprietary technology. Accordingly, protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. Staffing due to the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups can be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention from executing our business plan and could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the area surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Any inability to accurately and timely report and file our financial results could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, any internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital.\nOur competition has greater resources.\nSeveral of our competitors, including, among others, Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by these competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us.\nBusiness interruptions could delay or prevent our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary facility and headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other natural disasters, epidemics, such as the COVID-19 epidemic, and other events that could disrupt our operations that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and success as an overall business.\nIf we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on an internal IT system monitored by certain internal employees and third-party service providers to maintain our IT systems; maintain financial records; retain sensitive data, such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, and suppliers; process orders; manage inventory; process shipments to customers; and operate other critical functions. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is critical to the classified processing and control standards that our suppliers require us to maintain and the success of our business operations and our strategic goals.\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, and routine updates and modifications. Despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.\nIn addition, our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. For example, we are required to make estimates about, among other things, accruals, inventory reserves, revenue and lease accounting as well as other long lived assets. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we may be required to significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results. Any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on us, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Investing in Our Securities\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our industry;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nincreases in the number of shares of common stock outstanding as our preferred stock converts to common stock, or as warrants are exercised, or both;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or our shareholders;\n\u25cf\noperating results that fall below expectations, including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments;\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in expected national defense spending or budgets;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u25cf\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nany future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and shareholders.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Our stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the OTCQB Market and, previously, on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Market and volume fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Market and trading volumes have been limited.\nAs compared to a larger stock market with greater liquidity, our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB\u2122, which is the middle tier of the Over-the Counter Market, or the OTC, reserved for companies that are registered and reporting with the SEC or a U.S. banking regulator. The volume of trading of our common stock on the OTCQB has been very thin. Therefore, an investor might find it more difficult than it would be on a larger stock exchange to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our securities.\nWe cannot be certain that a more active trading market will develop or, if developed, be sustained. We also cannot be certain that purchasers of our common stock will be able to resell their common stock at prices equal to or greater than their purchase price. The development of a public market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. We do not have any control over whether there will be sufficient numbers of buyers and sellers. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that an established and liquid market for our common stock will develop or be maintained. The market price of our common stock could experience significant fluctuations in response to our operating results and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These fluctuations, and general economic and market conditions, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nThe trading price of our common stock may make it more difficult for you to trade shares of our common stock.\nWe could become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rule if we fail to meet certain financial criteria set forth in the rule. If we become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rule, the rule would impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer would have to make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, if it were to apply to us, the rule could have an adverse effect on the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and could affect the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell our securities in the secondary market. If our common stock were to become a \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rule, additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in penny stocks, which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock.\nWhile our common stock is not subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rule, some broker-dealers may nonetheless choose to limit your ability to trade shares of our common stock, which could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares, as well as having a material adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock ranks junior to all of our preferred stock and indebtedness.\nAs of March 28, 2020, our outstanding preferred shares had an aggregate liquidation preference of $3.7 million and we had an aggregate of $4.6 million in debt and other liabilities including long term lease obligations.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding-up, our assets will be available to make payments to holders of our common stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and all of the liquidation preferences on any then outstanding Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E preferred stock have been paid. Consequently, if we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts to the holders of shares of our common stock then issued and outstanding.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants, options and shares of convertible preferred stock, which may cause significant dilution to our shareholders, adversely impact the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.\nAs of March 28, 2020, we had 2,635,856 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as of that date we had outstanding warrants to acquire 163,545 shares of common stock, options to acquire 240,758 shares of common stock and shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 2,698,164 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants or options or conversion of preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all holders of our common stock, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe fact that our shareholders, warrant holders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nWe may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder\u2019s ownership of common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, generally without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock would be dilutive to an existing shareholder\u2019s ownership of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend and liquidation rights of common shareholders without their approval. To the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of our common or preferred stock.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our shareholders may decide to sell some or all of their shares of common stock that they currently hold or could acquire upon the conversion of our preferred stock or exercise of warrants or other derivative securities by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market. Any substantial sale of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends to our shareholders, so you will not receive any return on your investment in our common stock prior to selling your interest in the Company.\nWe have never paid any dividends to our common shareholders and do not foresee doing so. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a regular basis. The success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your common stock and, for the other reasons discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the documents incorporated herein by reference, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares.\nIf securities industry analysts do not publish research reports on us, or publish unfavorable reports on us, then the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nAny trading market for our common stock may be influenced in part by any research reports that securities industry analysts publish about us. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities industry analysts. If no securities industry analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected. In the event we are covered by analysts, and one or more of such analysts downgrade our securities, or otherwise reports on us unfavorably, or discontinues coverage of us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.", "PERMNO": 39029, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "GIGA"}
