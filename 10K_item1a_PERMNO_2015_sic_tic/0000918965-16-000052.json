These risks should be considered in connection with evaluating an investment in our company and, in particular, the forward-looking statements contained in this Report because these risks could cause the actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Additionally, there are other risks that we may not describe, because we currently do not perceive them to be material or because they are presently unknown, which could impact us. If any of these risks develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any risk factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nInternational operations - Our international operations expose us to risks that are different from, and possibly greater than, the risks we are exposed to domestically.\nWe currently have significant facilities outside the United States, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations. These operations are subject to a variety of risks that are different from the risks that we face domestically or are similar risks but with potentially greater exposure. These risks include:\n\u2022\nFluctuations of foreign currency, exchange rates, which can impact sales, costs of the goods we sell, and the reporting of our results and assets on our financial statements;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nChanges in, or expiration of, various foreign incentives that provide economic benefits to us;\n\u2022\nLabor laws that impact our ability to hire, retain, and discharge employees;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and managing operations in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nChanges in international trade laws, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, affecting our import and export activities, including export license requirements, restrictions on the export of certain technology, and tariff changes;\n\u2022\nChanges in the interpretation and enforcement of laws (in particular related to items such as duty and taxation);\n\u2022\nGlobal economic and financial market instability related to the U.K.\u2019s referendum withdrawal from the E.U.;\n\u2022\nPotential political and economic instability and changes in governments;\n\u2022\nCompliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and anti-corruption laws, including the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws of other jurisdictions, for our business activities outside the United States, the violation of which could result in severe penalties, including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export or import privileges; and\n\u2022\nTerrorist or military actions that result in destruction or seizure of our assets or suspension or disruption of our operations or those of our customers.\nAcquisitions - Our growth strategy includes acquisitions of companies that complement or expand our existing business. Acquisitions involve unique risks and uncertainties.\nWe have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, companies that complement or expand our existing business in the United States and internationally, and some of these acquisitions may be in lines of business where we have little, if any, experience. Acquisitions entail a number of risks, including that the acquired company will not perform as expected and that we will be responsible for unexpected costs or liabilities. In addition, increases in the size and complexity of our business place a significant strain on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions, and there are no assurances that we will be able to manage the acquisition process or newly acquired companies effectively. Our personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to effectively manage our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in multiple domestic and international locations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain and manage the personnel required to address our growth. Failure to effectively manage our growth opportunities could damage our reputation, limit our future growth, negatively affect our operating results, and harm our business.\nGrowth strategies - If we fail to effectively manage and implement our organic growth strategies, we will experience a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nA significant component of our growth strategy has been to add new vendors and products, and we expect to be able to enter new product markets in the future. Expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems, require additional resources that might not be available (or available on acceptable terms), result in new or more intense competition, may require longer implementation times or greater start-up expenditures than anticipated, and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion, if at all. In addition, while we have been very successful in adding new vendors in the past, we already represent most of the significant vendors in our primary areas of focus, and there is regular consolidation among our vendors. As a result, there may be fewer expansion opportunities of this nature in the future. If we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner, then our revenues may not grow.\nOur ability to successfully manage our growth will require continued enhancement of our operational, managerial and financial resources and controls. Our failure to effectively manage our growth would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result, we may require additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.\nBrexit - The U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the E.U. will have uncertain effects and could adversely affect our business.\nA majority of U.K. voters recently voted for the U.K. to exit the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d). Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U., including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U.\nand the rest of the world. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees. We currently transact business in the U.K., where we also have offices and a distribution center, and in key E.U. markets.\nCredit exposure - We have credit exposure to our reseller customers. Any adverse trends in their businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses.\nAs is customary in our industry, we extend credit to our customers, and most of our sales are on open accounts. We may be unable to collect on receivables if our reseller customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services, do not manage their businesses adequately, or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions or refinancing events. As we grow and compete for business, our typical payment terms tend to be longer, and therefore may increase our credit risk.\nWhile we evaluate our customers' qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit, and in some instances purchase credit insurance, these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses, and credit losses negatively impact our performance. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, we estimate future credit losses and establish reserves. To the extent that our credit losses exceed those reserves, our financial performance will be negatively impacted beyond what is expected. If there is deterioration in the collectability of our receivables, or if we are unable to collect under credit insurance policies, or we fail to take other actions to adequately mitigate such credit risk, our earnings, cash flows and our ability to utilize receivable-based financing could deteriorate.\nIn addition, extending credit to international customers involves additional risks. It is often more difficult to evaluate credit of a customer or obtain credit protections in our international operations. Also, credit cycles and collection periods are typically longer in our international operations. As a result of these factors and other challenges in extending credit to international customers, we generally face greater credit risk from sales internationally compared to domestic sales.\nBrazilian and Latin America operations - We face special political, economic and regulatory risks by doing business in Brazil and other Latin American countries, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial operations in Brazil and other Latin American countries and face risks related to these country's complex tax, labor, trade compliance and consumer protection laws and regulations. Additionally, developing markets such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru have greater political volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, are more likely than developed economies to experience market, currency and interest rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation. In addition, doing business in these countries poses additional challenges, such as finding and retaining qualified employees, particularly management-level employees, underdeveloped infrastructure, and identifying and retaining qualified suppliers and service providers, among other risks. Furthermore, in developing markets it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws. Our commitment to compliance with these laws could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any lapses in our compliance could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, competition in developing markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations. Our success in integrating our Brazilian and additional Latin American operations is critical to our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in these countries, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nVendor relationships - Terminations of a distribution or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms, authorizations, or lack of product availability, or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins, revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations.\nA significant percentage of our net sales relates to products we purchase from relatively few vendors. As a result of such concentration risk, terminations of supply or services agreements or a change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our key vendors could negatively affect our operating margins, revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations. Our vendors have the ability to make adverse changes in their sales terms and conditions, such as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us. We have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our vendors. In certain product categories, limited price protection or return rights offered by our vendors may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to stock. Our inability to pass through to our reseller customers the impact of these changes, as well as our failure to develop\nsystems to manage ongoing vendor programs, could cause us to record inventory write-downs or other losses and could have significant negative impact on our gross margins.\nWe receive purchase discounts and rebates from some vendors based on various factors, including goals for quantitative and qualitative sales or purchase volume and customer related metrics. Certain purchase discounts and rebates may affect gross margins. Many purchase discounts from vendors are based on percentage increases in sales of products. Our operating results would be negatively impacted if these rebates or discounts are reduced or eliminated or if our vendors significantly increase the complexity of their refund procedures and thus increase costs for us to receive such rebates.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and our ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. Our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain of their suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis. As a result, we have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, short-term shortages of specific products. We cannot provide any assurances that vendors will be able to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill all of our customer orders on a timely basis.\nVendors who currently distribute their products through us, may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution with other distributors, their own dealer networks, or directly to resellers or end-users. Vendors have, from time to time, made efforts to reduce the number of distributors with which they do business. This could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these vendors, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our reputation, sales and profitability may suffer if vendors are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or if we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product lines.\nIn addition, our dependence on a limited number of vendors leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products, price increases, late deliveries, and poor product quality. Like other distributors in our industry, we occasionally experience shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products. Increasingly, our vendors are combining and merging together, leaving us with fewer alternative sources. If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products, or if vendors do not regularly invest in, introduce to us, and/or make new products available to us for distribution, our revenue and gross profit could suffer considerably. Finally, we cannot provide any assurance that particular products, or product lines, will be available to us, or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nVendor consolidation may also lead to changes in the nature and terms of relationships with our vendors. The loss or deterioration of a major vendor relationship would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomer relationships - We operate in a highly competitive environment and good customer relations are critical to our success. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and expand our customer relationships or acquire new customers.\nMeeting our customers' needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success. Our transactions with our customers are generally performed on a purchase order basis rather than under long term supply agreements. Therefore, our customers can readily choose to purchase from other distributors. From time to time, we experience shortages in availability of some products from vendors, and this impacts our customers' decisions regarding whether to make purchases from us. Anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results. Accordingly, our sales can vary as a result of fluctuations in pricing, product availability, purchasing patterns of end-users and general competitive and economic conditions.\nIT Systems and the transition to a new Enterprise Resource Planning System - Our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems. A failure of these systems could disrupt our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business, including our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") systems. In order to continue support of our growth, we are making significant technological upgrades to our information systems. This is a lengthy and expensive process that has resulted, and will continue to result in a diversion of resources from other operations.\nAs we continue to implement our new ERP system in additional geographies, any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and/or implementation of the system, or in the performance of our legacy systems, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business and potentially our customers' ability to access our price and product availability information or place orders. Further, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues\ncould impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost-effective basis. Furthermore, we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems, expand and improve them, integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs, and convert to new systems efficiently when required. Any disruption to our business due to such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated, could have an adverse effect on our financial results and operations.\nOur customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information, including availability and pricing. There can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions, and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales, ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business. Many of our customers use our website to check real-time product availability, see their customized pricing and place orders. The Internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. While our website has not experienced any material disruptions or security breakdowns, any disruptions or breaches in security or a breach that compromises sensitive information could harm our relationship with our vendors, customers and other business partners. Any material disruption of our website or the Internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our vendors and customers from accessing information and cause us to lose business.\nDisruptive technology - We may not be able to respond and adapt to rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards or changing customer needs or requirements, and thus may become less competitive.\nOur ability to react quickly to new technology trends and customer requirements is crucial to our overall success, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to evolve our product offerings or engage with desirable vendors in time to respond to, and remain ahead of, new technological developments, it would adversely affect our ability to retain or increase market share and revenues. New technologies may emerge that quickly surpass the capabilities of the products we currently hold in inventory or have access to sell through our existing vendor network, and our customers may no longer view our product offerings as desirable, which could result in a reduction in our market share and ability to obtain sufficient profit margins. Some of our competitors and our vendors\u2019 competitors may be more nimble in adapting to disruptive technology or entering new markets. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt and manage our product offerings to meet customer needs at prices that our customers are willing to pay.\nPeople - The departure, transition or replacement of key personnel could significantly impact results of our operations. If we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased salary and benefit costs. Like most businesses, our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management, sales, IT, operational, finance and administrative personnel. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values. We want to hire and retain employees who will fit our culture of providing exceptional service to our vendors and customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain and motivate employees, including those in executive, senior management, sales, marketing, logistics, technical support and other operating positions. Our worldwide management structure provides improved management of our operations and improved succession planning within our organization.\nMany of our employees work in small teams to provide specific services to vendors and customers. They are trained to develop their knowledge of vendor products, programs and practices and customer business needs, as well as to enhance the skills required to provide exceptional service and to manage our business. As they gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills, our employees become highly desired by other businesses. Therefore, to retain our employees, we have to provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits. If our costs to retain our skilled employees increase, then our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nCompetition - We experience intense competition in all of our markets. Such competition could result in reduced margins and loss of our market share.\nThe markets that we operate in are fiercely competitive. We compete on the basis of price, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, credit availability, ability to tailor solutions to the needs of our customers, quality and breadth of product line and services and availability of technical and product information. Our competitors include\nlocal, regional, national and international distributors as well as hardware manufacturers (including most of our vendors) that sell directly to resellers and to end-users. In addition, we compete with master resellers that sell to franchisees, third party dealers and end-users. Certain of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Certain smaller, regional competitors, who are specialty two-tier or mixed model master resellers, may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Competition has increased for our sales units as broad line and other value-added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets. Such competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of our market share.\nAs a result of intense price competition in our industry, our gross margins and our operating profit margins have historically been narrow, and we expect them to be narrow in the future. To remain competitive, we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers. This could result in an increase in our need for capital, increase our financing costs, increase our bad debt expenses and have a negative impact on our financial results. We do not offer any assurance that we will not lose market share, or that we will not be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to the action of our competitors and thereby experience a reduction in our gross margins. We expect continued intense competition as current competitors expand their operations and new competitors enter the market. Our inability to compete successfully against current and future competitors could cause our revenue and earnings to decline.\nInternal control over financial reporting - The internal control structure we have in place over our financial reporting may not be effective in detecting fraud or errors in a timely manner, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securities.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting designated to insure that we record transactions, assets and liabilities in our financial records in an accurate and timely manner may be identified in the future. Any failure in these controls could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligation, or result in errors in our financial statements. The existence of errors in our financial statements could result in liability under the securities laws, significant costs relating to correcting the errors and the loss of investor confidence. We do not expect our internal control over financial reporting to detect all errors or fraudulent conduct.\nCentralized functions - We have centralized a number of functions to provide efficient support to our business. As a result, a loss or reduction of use of one of our locations would have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results.\nIn order to be as efficient as possible, we centralize a number of critical functions. For instance, we currently distribute products to the majority of North America from a single warehouse. Similarly, for the primary business operations, we utilize a single information system based in the United States for the majority of our North American and European operations, while our Latin American operations have separate systems. While we have backup systems and business continuity plans, any significant or lengthy interruption of our ability to provide these centralized functions would significantly impair our ability to continue normal business operations. In addition, the centralization of these functions increases our exposure to local risks, such as the availability of qualified employees and the lessening of competition for critical services, such as freight and communications.\nInventory - The value of our inventory may be adversely affected by market and other factors.\nOur business, like that of other distributors, is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be adversely affected by price reductions by manufacturers, by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of our products or by foreign currency fluctuations. Under the terms of most of our vendor agreements and the policy of most manufacturers of specialty technology products, we have some price protection and stock rotation opportunities with respect to slow-moving or obsolete inventory items. However, these protections are limited in scope and do not protect against all declines in inventory value, excess inventory, or product obsolescence, and in some instances we may not be able to fulfill all necessary conditions or successfully manage such price protection or stock rotation opportunities. In addition, these industry practices are sometimes not reflected in vendor agreements and their application in a particular situation is dependent upon negotiations between our vendors and us. As a result, from time-to-time we are required to write down the value of excess and obsolete inventory, and should any of these write-downs occur at a significant level, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLiquidity and capital resources - Market factors may increase the cost and availability of capital. Additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs and growth.\nOur business requires significant levels of capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors. We have an increased demand for capital when our business is expanding, including through acquisitions. Changes\nin payment terms with either suppliers or customers could increase our capital requirements. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, secured and unsecured borrowings, and, to a lesser extent, borrowings under a subsidiary's line of credit to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth. While we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will provide sufficient resources to meet our current working capital and cash requirements, if we require an increase in capital to meet our future business needs, such capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Changes in how lenders rate our credit worthiness, as well as macroeconomic factors such as an economic downturn and global economic instability may restrict our ability to raise capital in adequate amounts or on terms acceptable to us, and the failure to do so could harm our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition, our cash and cash equivalents are deposited with various financial institutions located in the various countries in which we operate. We endeavor to monitor these financial institutions regularly for credit quality; however, we are exposed to risk of loss on such funds or we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to suffer bankruptcy or similar restructuring.\nCyber security risk - Our reputation and business may be harmed from cyber security risk and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers' or our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer or employee information or those of service providers or business partners may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security, or that of our third-party service provider, and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. As a result, our customers' information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our customers' consent.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to customer privacy and the protection of personal information. Any such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers' or business partners' information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nReliance on third parties - We are dependent on third parties for services including, the delivery of a majority of our products, logistics and warehousing. Changes in shipping terms or the failure or inability of our third-party shippers to perform could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on arrangements with third parties to perform certain services for our business and for our customers, which, if not performed by these third parties in accordance with the terms of the arrangement could result in significant disruptions or costs to our organization, including monetary damages and an adverse effect on our customer relationships.\nIn particular, we are dependent upon major shipping companies, including FedEx and UPS, for the shipment of our products to and from our centralized warehouses. Changes in shipping terms, or the inability of these third-party shippers to perform effectively (whether as a result of mechanical failure, casualty loss, labor stoppage, or any other reason), could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we have experienced significant increases in shipping costs due to increases in fuel costs. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of our carriers could have an adverse impact on our logistical processes and shipping costs. Poor financial condition of our freight carriers could result in delayed responsiveness in their service lead times, which would ultimately affect our responsiveness to our customers. Additionally, if our carriers were to increase our shipping costs, it may adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers.\nIn Europe, Brazil and other Latin American countries, we use third parties to provide warehousing and logistics services in order to provide cost-effective operations and scale in certain regions. The failure or inability of one or more of these third parties to deliver products from suppliers to us or products from us to our customers for any reason could disrupt our business and harm our reputation and operating results. We work closely with our third-party logistics and warehousing providers to anticipate issues, and also review public information regarding their financial health. However, issues may not be identified timely, which may lead to lack of or poor execution, loss or litigation. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of our logistical and warehousing\nproviders could result in delayed responsiveness or delivery failure, which would ultimately affect our responsiveness to our customers and thus may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nIncreased government scrutiny - We may be subject to additional costs and subject to fines and penalties because certain governmental entities are end-users of products that we sell.\nCertain of our customers may sell our products to U.S. government entities, which may require us to comply with additional laws, regulations, or contractual requirements relating to how we conduct business. In complying with these laws, regulations, and other requirements, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may also allow for the assignment of fines and penalties, including contractual damages or the loss of certain contracts or business. We may also be subject to increased scrutiny and investigation into our business practices, which may increase operating costs and increase legal liability, as well as expose us to additional risk surrounding our reputation.\nFair value measurement of contingent consideration, goodwill and other intangible assets - Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities measured at fair value could have a significant effect on our reported earnings.\nWe have structured several of our acquisitions with upfront payments and additional earnout payments. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, a liability for the contingent consideration driven by an earn-out must be recorded at the onset of the purchase and must be revalued at every reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as an adjustment to operating income. These changes can occur due to changes in estimated future financial results, the probabilities of achieving these results, the discount rate reflective of our creditworthiness, and the market risk premium associated with the Brazilian market. Both gains and losses can occur due to changes in these fair value estimates, thus increasing volatility of our earnings.\nOn at least an annual basis, we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets, including but not limited to customer relationships and trade names, for impairment. This includes continuously monitoring events and circumstances that could trigger an impairment test outside of our annual impairment testing date in the fourth quarter of each year. Testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment requires the use of significant estimates and other inputs outside of our control. If the carrying value of goodwill in any of our goodwill reporting units or other intangible assets is determined to exceed their respective fair values, we may be required to record significant impairment charges that would adversely affect our operating results.\nGoodwill impairments - Goodwill impairments and impairments of long-lived assets could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have substantial goodwill. We test our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all reporting units, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review. We were not required to record an impairment charge with respect to our goodwill within the past three years. However, in the future, the fair value of one of our reporting units may decrease below its carrying amount and future goodwill impairments that may be material could be recognized. Any declines resulting in a goodwill impairment or long-lived asset impairment may result in material non-cash charges to our earnings. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareholders' equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets.\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations - We are subject to various environmental regulations, and failing to comply with any requirements may adversely affect our business operations or financial results.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. Compliance with these environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business. These laws include the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, (\"RoHS\"), RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU (\"RoHS 2\") and the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\"WEEE\") as enacted by individual European Union countries and other similar legislation adopted in North America. These directives can make companies involved in the production or distribution of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of recovered products. In addition, these directives and similar legislation can have an impact on the types and design of products we are able to sell in jurisdictions that have adopted such restrictions. While we strive to ensure we are in compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose strict liability. Additionally, we may be held responsible for the prior activities of entities that we have acquired or will acquire in the future. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nQuarterly fluctuations - Our net sales and operating results are dependent on a number of factors. Our net sales will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly and, as a result our performance in one period may vary significantly from our performance in the preceding quarter, and may differ significantly from our forecast of performance from quarter to quarter. The impact of these variances may cause volatility in our stock price. Additionally, any past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in the future as our operating results may fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter. The results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year.\nVolatility of Stock Price- The trading price of our common stock.\nThe stock market as a whole and the trading prices of companies in the wholesale electronics industry have been volatile. This broad market and industry volatility could significantly reduce the price of our common stock at any time, without regard to our own operating performance. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, transactions, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments.\nA material decline in the price of our common stock may result in the assertion of certain claims against us, and/or the commencement of inquiries and/or investigations against us. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital, if needed, and the inability for you to obtain a favorable price at which you could sell your shares.\nLitigation - We routinely are involved in litigation that can be costly and lead to adverse results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a wide range of disputes, some of which result in litigation. In addition, as a public company with a large shareholder base, we are susceptible to class-action and other litigation resulting from disclosures that we make (or do not make) and our other activities. Litigation is expensive to bring and defend, and the outcome of litigation can be adverse and significant. Not all adverse outcomes can be anticipated, and applicable accounting rules do not always require or permit the establishment of a reserve until a final result has occurred or becomes probable and estimable. In some instances we are insured for the potential losses; in other instances we are not. An uninsured or underinsured adverse outcome in significant litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We can make no assurances that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these disputes.
