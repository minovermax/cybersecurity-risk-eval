{"cik": "1078207", "company": "NAUTILUS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nNautilus operates in an environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that presently are not considered material or are not known to us, and therefore are not mentioned herein, may impair our business operations. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K actually occur, our business, operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nOur business is typically affected by seasonality which results in fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe typically experience fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. In years prior to 2020, sales were typically strongest in the fourth quarter and are generally weakest in the second quarter. The stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic largely nullified the seasonality we typically experience. The mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of fitness equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nThe loss of one or more of our large Retail customers could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of Retail customers. A Retail customer or any of our retail partners may in the future experience difficulties in their businesses that could prompt store closures or reorganizations. A loss of business from one or more of these large customers, if not replaced with new business, could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur inventory purchases are subject to long lead times, which could negatively impact our revenue, cash flows and liquidity.\nAll of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, substantially all of which are located in Asia, primarily China. Lead times for inventory purchases from our Asian suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately two to three months, of which transit time represents three to four weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand for our products. Due to the length of our lead times, our revenue and cash flows may be negatively impacted if we do not have sufficient inventory on hand to meet customer demand for such items. In addition, our liquidity and cash flows may be negatively affected, and inventory obsolescence may increase, if the quantity of products we order exceeds customer demand for such items.\nIf our contract manufacturers experience any delay, disruption or quality control problems in their operations, we could lose revenues, and our reputation and market share may be harmed\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers exposes us to the following risks over which we may have limited control:\n\u2022Unexpected increases in manufacturing and repair costs;\n\u2022Interruptions in shipments if our contract manufacturer is unable to complete production;\n\u2022Inability to completely control the quality of finished products;\n\u2022Inability to completely control delivery schedules;\n\u2022Changes in our contract manufacturer's business models or operations;\n\u2022Potential increases in our negotiated product costs as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022Impact of the global market and economic conditions on the financial stability of our contract manufacturers and their ability to operate without requesting earlier payment terms or letters of credit;\n\u2022Potential lack of adequate capacity to manufacture all or a part of the products we require; and\n\u2022Potential unauthorized reproduction or counterfeiting of our products.\nSubstantially all of our contract manufacturers are located in Asia, primarily China, and may be subject to disruption by natural disasters, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, as well as political, social or economic instability. The temporary or permanent loss of the services of any of our primary contract manufacturers could cause a significant disruption in our product supply chain and operations and delays in product shipments. For\nexample, the recent spread of the COVID-19 and related quarantines and work and travel restrictions in China has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, production for certain of our products, and the extent to which these events will affect our results of operations and financial position remains uncertain. Such uncertainties, and disruptions caused by other public health crises, natural disasters and instability, could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, reduce demand for our products or force us to incur remediation costs, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration and some manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current relationships with these parties or, if necessary, establish future arrangements with other third-party manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms. Further, while we maintain an active quality control, factory inspection and qualification program, we cannot assure that their manufacturing and quality control processes will be maintained at a level sufficient to meet our inventory needs or prevent the inadvertent sale of substandard products. While we believe that products manufactured by our current third-party manufacturers could generally be procured from alternative sources, temporary or permanent loss of services from a significant manufacturer could cause disruption in our supply chain and operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, based on our estimates of future demand for particular products and services. Failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in manufacturing delays or increased costs. Our ability to accurately forecast demand could be affected by many factors, including changes in consumer demand for our products and services, changes in demand for the products and services of our competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, such as those caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak. This risk will be exacerbated by the fact that we may not carry a significant amount of inventory and may not be able to satisfy short-term demand increases. For example, we have experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our connected fitness products as a result of government shelter-in-place orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in inventory shortages and delayed delivery timelines. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale.\nInventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would cause our gross margins to suffer and could impair the strength and premium nature of our brand. Further, lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies, which could result in lower margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, our suppliers and manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements or we may be subject to higher costs in order to secure the necessary production capacity. An inability to meet consumer demand and delays in the delivery of our products to our customers could result in reputational harm and damaged customer relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to warranty claims for our products, which could result in unexpected expense.\nMany of our products carry warranties for defects in quality and workmanship. We may experience significant expense as the result of product quality issues, product recalls or product liability claims which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We maintain a warranty reserve for estimated future warranty claims. However, the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed the reserve and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPortions of our operating expenses and costs of goods sold are relatively fixed, and we may have limited ability to reduce expenses sufficiently in response to any revenue shortfalls.\nMany of our operating expenses are relatively fixed. We may not be able to adjust our operating expenses or other costs sufficiently to adequately respond to any revenue shortfalls. If we are unable to reduce operating expenses or other costs quickly in response to any declines in revenue, it would negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences or to effectively develop, market and sell future products, our future revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends on our ability to effectively develop, market and sell new products that respond to new and evolving consumer preferences. Accordingly, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire rights to new products that satisfy consumer preferences. In addition, any new products that we market may not generate sufficient revenues to recoup their acquisition, development, production, marketing, selling and other costs.\nWe may be unable to adapt to significant changes in media consumption habits and media coverage of current events may compete for consumer attention, which could diminish the effectiveness or efficiency of our advertising.\nNew technologies and services, such as streaming services and social media have changed traditional patterns of media coverage and consumption. Additionally, consumer attention is increasingly fragmented across a variety of traditional and digital media the balance of which may shift at any time in response to media coverage of current events and the advancement of new technologies. We believe that consumer attention to media coverage of major events, such as the Olympics and the U.S. presidential election, have, in the past, impacted the effectiveness of our media advertising. Future events that draw significant media coverage may similarly impact our ability to engage consumers with our media advertising. If we are unable to successfully adapt our media strategies to new television viewing and media consumption habits, or if consumer attention is focused on other events, the effectiveness and efficiency of our media placements could be adversely affected, and our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nSubstantially higher advertising rates or a significant decline in availability of media time may hinder our ability to effectively market our products and may reduce profitability.\nWe depend media advertising to market certain products sold directly to consumers. Consequently, an increase in the price we must pay for our preferred medium, or a reduction in its availability, may adversely impact our financial performance.\nHealth epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems\nOur business and operations has been and may continue to be affected by health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we and our partners, advertisers, and customers operate. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant worldwide operational and economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, and the extent to which COVID-19 will adversely impact our business is highly uncertain, rapidly changing, and cannot be accurately predicted. A continued slowdown or downturn in the economy may have a negative impact on many of our customers.\nPublic health officials worldwide have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in heavily populated areas and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. As a result, we have temporarily closed our offices and retailers have permanently closed some locations and curtailed occupancy of remaining locations. Some retail partners have increased their online presence or allowed for buy online, pick up in store. Our financial results could be adversely impacted by these retail store closures and other actions taken to contain or treat the impact of COVID-19, and the extent of such impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline from a reduced demand for our products or services from the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, supply chains and distribution systems. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, unpredictable supply and demand for certain of our products and services.\nAs a result of COVID-19, we have been unable to satisfy certain customer orders for our products. As a result, our customers have experienced delays in receiving our products due to difficulties in sourcing logistics from Asia during the pandemic and the resulting higher costs associated with securing shipping slots from Asia. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic uncertainty and\nmacroeconomic conditions, and, as a result, the ultimate impact on our business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nIn addition, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, potentially reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. While the spread of COVID-19 may eventually be contained or mitigated, there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur, or that the global economy will recover, either of which could seriously harm our business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, public health crises, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nOur business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar events. The third-party systems and operations and contract manufacturers we rely on are subject to similar risks. Our insurance policies may not cover losses from these events or may provide insufficient compensation that does not cover our total losses. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers\u2019 and contract manufacturers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting locations that store significant inventory of our products, that house our servers, or from which we generate content. As we rely heavily on our computer and communications systems, and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt suppliers\u2019 and our contract manufacturers\u2019 businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nDisruption to our information and communication systems could result in interruptions to our business and potential implementation of new systems for critical business functions may heighten the risk of disruption.\nOur business is reliant on information and communication technology, and a substantial portion of our revenues are generated with the support of information and communication systems. The success of our Direct business is heavily dependent on our ability to respond to customer sales inquiries and process sales transactions using our call center communication systems, websites and similar data monitoring and communication systems provided and supported by third-parties. If such systems were to fail, or experience significant or lengthy interruptions in availability or service, our revenues could be materially affected. We also rely on information systems in all stages of our product cycle, from design to distribution, and we use such systems as a method of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. In addition, we use information systems to maintain our accounting records, assist in trade receivables collection and customer service efforts, and forecast operating results and cash flows.\nSystem failures or service interruptions may occur as the result of a number of factors, including: computer viruses; hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties; disasters; equipment, hardware or software failures; ineffective design or implementation of new systems or systems upgrades; cable outages, extended power failures, or our inability or failure to properly protect, repair or maintain our communication and information systems. To mitigate the risk of business interruption, we have in place a disaster recovery program that targets our most critical operational systems. If our disaster recovery system is ineffective, in whole or in part, or efforts conducted by us or third-parties to prevent or respond to system interruptions in a timely manner are ineffective, our ability to conduct operations would be significantly affected. If we do not consider the potential impact of critical decisions related to systems or process design and implementation, this could lead to operational challenges and increased costs. Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss,\ninadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our revenue, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nOur products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation.\nWe offer complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties. Any such defects could make our products and services unsafe, create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury, and subject us to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. In addition, from time to time we may experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors that affect our fitness and wellness programming. As a result, our services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software, and services we offer. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our products and services and could lead to claims against us. We maintain general liability insurance; however, design and manufacturing defects, and claims related thereto, may subject us to judgments or settlements that result in damages materially in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. In addition, we may be exposed to recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property and equipment, or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses such as litigation costs and regulatory fines. If we cannot successfully defend any large claim, maintain our general liability insurance on acceptable terms, or maintain adequate coverage against potential claims, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Further, quality problems could adversely affect the experience for users of our products and services, and result in harm to our reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for our products and services, delay in new product and service introductions, and lost revenue.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its products, services and business needs.\nOur success depends on the ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of products, services and business needs. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries and business operations. In addition, we rely on a variety of technologies, including those that support order management, billing, and consumer analytics. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, our services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.\nFuture impairments of intangible assets could negatively impact our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had other intangible assets of $9.4 million. Any future impairment charges, if significant, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. An unexpected decline in revenue, changes\nin market conditions, changes in competitive products or technologies or a change in management's intentions regarding utilization of intangible assets could lead to future impairment charges.\nEconomic and External Market Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent product introduction. Our products and services face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including at-home fitness equipment and digital platforms, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Further, we expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that compete with ours.\nOur competitors may develop, or have already developed, products, features, content, services, or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more successful product development efforts, create more compelling employment opportunities, or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may develop or acquire, or have already developed or acquired, intellectual property rights that significantly limit or prevent our ability to compete effectively in the public marketplace. In addition, some competitors may have greater resources, or lack a short-term profitability motive, allowing them to identify and capitalize more efficiently upon opportunities in new markets and consumer preferences and trends, quickly transition and adapt their products and services, devote greater resources to marketing and advertising, or be better positioned to withstand substantial price competition. If we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors, they may acquire and engage customers or generate revenue at the expense of our efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nDecline in consumer spending would likely negatively affect our product revenues and earnings.\nSuccess of each of our products depends substantially on the amount of discretionary funds available to our customers. Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions in the recent past, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that similar disruptions will not occur in the future. Deterioration in general economic conditions may depress consumer spending, especially spending for discretionary consumer products such as ours. Poor economic conditions could, in turn, lead to substantial decreases in our net sales or have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur revenues could decline due to changes in credit markets and decisions made by credit providers.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our Direct sales have been financed for our customers under various programs offered by third-party consumer credit financing sources. Reductions in consumer lending and the availability of consumer credit could limit the number of customers with the financial means to purchase our products. Higher interest rates could increase monthly payments for consumer products financed through one of our financing partners or through other sources of consumer financing. In the past, we have partnered with financial service companies to assist our customers in obtaining financing to purchase our products. Our present agreements with our third-party consumer credit financing providers enable certain customers to obtain financing if they qualify for the provider's private label revolving credit card. We cannot be assured that our third-party financing providers will continue to provide consumers with access to credit or that credit limits under such arrangements will not be reduced. Such restrictions or reductions in the availability of consumer credit could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs, reduced margins or decreased international sales.\nSubstantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the U.S. and, therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs for our products, or could disrupt the business of independent manufacturers that produce our products, by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign\ncurrencies in which we, our customers or our suppliers conduct business. Past fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar have caused our costs for certain products to increase, reducing our margins and cash flows. Similar fluctuations and cost increases may occur in the future. If we are unable to increase our selling prices to offset such cost increases, or if such increases have a negative impact on sales of our products, our revenues and margins would be reduced and our operating results and cash flows would be negatively impacted. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside the U.S., primarily in Canada and Europe. Currency rate fluctuations could make our products more expensive for foreign consumers and reduce our revenue, which would negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to laws of the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to individually identifiable information and personal health information, and failure to comply with those laws, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur digital platforms may receive, process, transmit and store personal health and fitness information relating to identifiable individuals. Consumer demand for personalized fitness experiences, through mobile applications or wearable fitness trackers, and our strategy to focus on digital fitness solutions for our products may increase the volume of identifiable individual information we receive on our platforms and through our products. We also receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals in our capacity as an employer. As a result, we may be subject to United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect both individually identifiable information and personal health information, including HIPAA and its regulations, and the GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR includes, and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted, consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and include jurisdiction-specific obligations. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal data.\nThese and other related laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. Changes to existing laws, introduction of new laws in this area or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to obtain and process information and allegations by our customers and consumers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face competition from providers of comparable products in categories where our patent protection is limited or reduced due to patent expiration. Increased competition in those product categories could negatively affect our future revenues and operating results.\nSales of cardio products represent a substantial portion of our Direct segment revenues. Introduction by competitors of comparable products, a maturing product lifecycle or other factors could result in a continued decline in our revenues derived from this product line. A significant decline in our revenue from this product line, without offsetting sales gains, would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nTrademark infringement, patent infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs.\nOur industry is susceptible to litigation regarding trademark and patent infringement and other intellectual property rights. We could become a plaintiff or defendant in litigation involving trademark or patent infringement claims or claims for breach of a license agreement. The prosecution or defense of intellectual property litigation is both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management, regardless of the claim's merit. We could also be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation or related matters.\nWe may not be able to successfully acquire intellectual property rights, protect existing rights, or potentially prevent others from claiming that we have violated their proprietary rights. We could incur substantial costs in defending\nagainst such claims even if they are without basis, and we could become subject to judgments or settlements requiring us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other charges.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation, product liability risk and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.\nFrom time to time, we may be a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business or the former operations of our discontinued Commercial business segment. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and may result in substantial legal costs.\nOur business is exposed to potential false advertising and other related claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance.\nThe global nature of our business involves a risk of exposure under U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign laws and regulations related to false advertising. A false advertising claim or related judgment against us could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect consumer or customer confidence in our products and services, and divert management\u2019s time and attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product and general liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the type or level of coverage we have is adequate (or will apply to the claim at hand) or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A false advertising or other judgment against us and related negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may in the future be subject to claims and lawsuits alleging that our products fail to provide accurate measurements and data to our users.\nSome components of our digital platform are used to track and display various information about users\u2019 activities, such as calories burned, distance traveled and floors climbed. We anticipate new features and functionality in the future, as well. We believe that we have done, and will continue to do, everything we can to ensure accuracy of measurements in our digital system, but as with all such systems, there is always the risk that there may be an unintentional software design issue that results in measurements being inaccurately reported. We may receive reports made against us alleging that our products do not provide accurate measurements and data to users, including claims asserting that certain features of our products do not operate as advertised. Such reports and claims may result in negative publicity, and may require us to expend time and resources to defend litigation. If our products fail to provide accurate measurements and data to users, or if there are reports or claims of inaccurate measurements, claims of false advertisement, or claims of inaccuracy regarding the overall health benefits of our products and services in the future, we may become the subject of negative publicity, litigation, including class action litigation, regulatory proceedings, and warranty claims, and our brand, operating results, and business could be harmed.\nGovernment regulatory actions could disrupt our marketing efforts and product sales.\nVarious international and U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, regulate our product and marketing efforts. Our revenue and profitability could be significantly harmed if any of these authorities commence a regulatory enforcement action that interrupts our marketing efforts, results in a product recall or negative publicity, or requires changes in product design or marketing materials.\nChanges in international trade policy could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAll of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, substantially all of which are located in Asia, primarily in China. Additionally, we make significant sales to customers worldwide, and in particular to customers in Canada. Most of our imported products are subject to duties or tariffs that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the U.S. or our other markets. The prior U.S. presidential administration sought changes to, or the withdrawal of the United States from various international treaties and trade arrangements. Our operating results have been negatively impacted by tariffs imposed by the prior U.S. presidential administration. Uncertainty regarding future policies affecting global trade may make it difficult for our management to accurately forecast our\nbusiness, and increases in the duties, tariffs and other charges imposed on our products by the United States or other countries in which on our products are manufactured or sold, or other restraints on international trade, could negatively affect our business and the results of our operations.\nA delay in getting non-U.S.-sourced products through port operations and customs in a timely manner could result in reduced sales, canceled sales orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation.\nOur business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide. Labor disputes or other disruptions at ports create significant risks for our business, particularly if work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions occur during our peak importing seasons. Any of these factors could result in reduced sales, canceled sales orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nUnpredictable events and circumstances relating to our international operations, including our use of non-U.S. manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSubstantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the U.S. and a portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside the U.S., primarily in Canada, but also in markets outside North America. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors pertaining to international trade, including: changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; trade restrictions; import and export licensing requirements; changes in regulatory requirements; additional efforts to comply with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and longer payment cycles in certain countries, thus requiring us to finance customer purchases over a longer period than those made in the U.S. In addition, we rely on the performance of our employees located in foreign countries. Our ability to control the actions of these employees may be limited by the laws and regulations in effect in each country. Changes in any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products.\nWe are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which will require us to conduct due diligence on and disclose whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such due diligence activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes, or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\nFailure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position.\nProtecting our intellectual property is an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry. Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Many factors bear upon the exclusive ownership and right to exploit intellectual properties, including, without limitation, prior rights of third parties and nonuse and/or nonenforcement by us and/or related entities. While we make efforts to develop and protect our intellectual property, the validity, enforceability and commercial value of our intellectual property rights may be reduced or eliminated. We cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to compete successfully within the marketplace for our products. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. If we do not, or are unable to, adequately protect our intellectual property, then we may face difficulty in differentiating our products from those of our competitors and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur revenues and profitability can fluctuate from period to period and are often difficult to predict due to factors beyond our control.\nOur results of operations in any particular period may not be indicative of results to be expected in future periods, and have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to periodic fluctuations arising from a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Introduction and market acceptance of new products and sales trends affecting specific existing products;\n\u2022Variations in product selling prices and costs and the mix of products sold;\n\u2022Size and timing of Retail customer orders, which, in turn, often depend upon the success of our customers' businesses or specific products;\n\u2022Changes in the market conditions for consumer fitness equipment;\n\u2022Changes in macroeconomic factors;\n\u2022Availability of consumer credit;\n\u2022Timing and availability of products coming from our offshore contract manufacturing suppliers;\n\u2022Seasonality of markets, which vary from quarter-to-quarter and are influenced by outside factors such as overall consumer confidence and the availability and cost of television advertising time;\n\u2022Effectiveness of our media and advertising programs;\n\u2022Customer consolidation in our Retail segment, or the bankruptcy of any of our larger Retail customers;\n\u2022Restructuring charges;\n\u2022Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges; and\n\u2022Legal and contract settlement charges.\nThese trends and factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial position and cash flows in any particular period.\nOur business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.\nOur future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executives and skilled labor. Availability of skilled workers is critical to our operations. We may experience difficulty maintaining desired staffing levels with unemployment rates at low levels in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods. COVID-19 has added new challenges in attracting people for relocation.The loss of qualified personnel, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees or a delay in hiring key personnel, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a number of debt covenants.\nIn January 2020, we entered into new credit facility with Wells Fargo National Association for a period of five years ending January 2025. The proceeds from this new credit facilities were used to refinance our existing indebtedness. Our new credit facility contain certain debt covenants and other customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these debt covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these debt covenants may result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our our lender may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. If our current lender accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lender on a timely basis. In addition, these debt covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and may result in dilution to our existing shareholders.\nThe Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on November 9, 2020 with the SEC, that will allow us to issue up to $100 million in securities including common stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The shelf registration statement is intended to provide the Company with increased financial flexibility and more efficient access to the capital markets. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of these securities or the availability of the securities will have on the prevailing market price of our common stock from time to time. Substantial sales of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Such a decrease in our share price could in turn impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Future issuances of our common stock, or other securities convertible into our common stock, may result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders. Significant dilution would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power held by our existing shareholders.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, may incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in our fiscal year of 2019 of $92.8 million and may incur net losses in the future. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, expand our operating and retail infrastructure, add content and software features to our platform, expand into new geographies, develop new connected-fitness products and services, and in connection with legal, accounting, and other expenses related to operating as a public company. These efforts and additional expenses may be more costly than we expect, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our revenue to offset our operating expenses. Our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our products and services, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, the impacts to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, or if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities. If our revenue does not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe track certain operational and business metrics with internal methods that are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track certain operational and business metrics, including our connected fitness products, with internal methods, which are not independently verified by any third party and are often reliant upon an interface with mobile operating systems, networks and standards that we do not control. Our internal methods have limitations and our process for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we report. If the internal methods we use under-count or over-count metrics related to our connected fitness products metrics as a result of algorithm or other technical errors, the operational and business metrics that we report may not be accurate. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure certain operational and business metrics may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer term strategies. If our operational and business metrics are not accurate representations of our business, market penetration, retention or engagement; if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics; or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe may engage in merger and acquisition activities, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made or may in the future make investments in other companies, products, or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, in the future. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by Members or investors. Moreover, an acquisition, investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations, diverting management from their primary responsibilities, subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized, if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company.\nTo pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Additionally, we may receive indications of interest from other parties interested in acquiring some or all of our business. The time required to evaluate such indications of interest could require significant attention from management, disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.", "PERMNO": 86889, "SIC": 3949, "TIC": "NLS"}
