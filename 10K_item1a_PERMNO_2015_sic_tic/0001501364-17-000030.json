{"cik": "1501364", "company": "United Financial Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock. An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to lending risk and could incur losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices.\nUnited Bank originates commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans primarily within its market area. Commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers. These loans also have a greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nCommercial Business Loans: Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nCommercial Real Estate Loans: Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u2022\nConsumer Loans: Consumer loans are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss.\nWhile relatively stable, an economic slowdown, at the local and national level, is possible which could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from borrowers\u2019 businesses, thereby increasing the risk of potential increases in non-performing loans. The decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our commercial and residential real estate loans. A stagnation in the economy coupled with a slow economic recovery may also have a negative effect on the ability of our commercial borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings. If poor economic conditions were prolonged, it could result in decreased opportunities to make quality loans and our profits may decrease because our alternative investment opportunities may earn less income. The resultant market uncertainty may lead to a widespread reduction in general business activity. The resulting economic pressure brought to bear on consumers may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAll of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See further discussion on the commercial loan portfolio in \u201cLending Activities\u201d within \u201cItem 7 -Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf United Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loss and delinquency experience on different loan categories, and we evaluate existing economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance, which would decrease our net income. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to 0.87% of total loans outstanding and 125.64% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2016. Although we are unaware of any specific problems with our loan portfolio that would require any increase in our allowance at the present time, it may need to be increased further in the future, due to our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of commercial business and commercial real estate loans. Our allowance for loan losses to total covered loans was 1.03% at December 31, 2016.\nIn addition, banking regulators and other outside third parties, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on a myriad of factors and assumptions. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, which will be effective for the Company for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. This standard, often referred to as \u201cCECL\u201d (reflecting a current expected credit loss model), will require companies to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of losses expected to be realized over the contractual lives of the loans. Under current U.S. GAAP, companies generally recognize credit losses only when it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the balance sheet date. This new standard will require us to collect and review increased types and amounts of data for us to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nConcentration of loans in our primary market area may increase risk\nOur success is impacted by the general economic conditions in the geographic areas in which we primarily operate, primarily Connecticut, and Central and Western Massachusetts. Accordingly, the economic conditions in these markets have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans. As such, a decline in real estate valuations in these markets would lower the value of the collateral securing those loans. In addition, a significant weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, or other factors beyond our control could reduce our ability to generate new loans and increase default rates on those loans and otherwise negatively affect our financial results.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in the level of interest rates and the steepness of the yield curve. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. While we have modeled rising interest rate scenarios using historic data and such scenarios result in an increase in our net interest income, our interest-bearing liabilities may reprice or mature more quickly than modeled, thus resulting in a decrease in our net interest income. Further, a flatter yield curve than we modeled would also result in a decline net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our investment securities. Generally, the value of our investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Decreases in the fair value of our investment securities, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity or our earnings if the decrease in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of our loans and mortgage related securities. Decreases in interest rates may cause an increase in prepayments of our loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. As prepayment speeds on mortgage related securities increase, the premium amortization increases prospectively, and additionally there would be an adjustment required under the application of the interest method of income recognition, and will therefore result in lower net interest income. Under these circumstances, we are also subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on our existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nContinued or further declines in the value of certain investment securities could require write-downs, which would reduce our earnings.\nThe gross unrealized losses within our investment securities portfolio are due in part to an increase in credit spreads. We have concluded these unrealized losses are temporary in nature since they are not related to the underlying credit quality of the issuers or underlying assets, and we have the intent and ability to hold these investments for a time necessary to recover our cost at stated maturity (at which time, full payment is expected). However, a continued decline in the value of these securities due to deterioration in the underlying credit quality of the issuers or underlying assets or other factors could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce our earnings.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond our control. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of our common stock; changes in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments affecting our competitors or us. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against other companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. If we experience such volatility we could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur success depends on our key personnel, including our executive officers, and the loss of key personnel could disrupt our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly-skilled personnel. Competition for the very best people from our industry makes the hiring decision process complicated. Our ability to find seasoned individuals with specialized skill sets that match our needs, could prove difficult. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Company\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business because we would lose the employee\u2019s skills, knowledge of the market and years of industry experience and may have difficulty finding qualified replacement personnel.\nUnited has opened new branches and may open additional new branches and loan production offices which may incur losses during their initial years of operation as they generate new deposit and loan portfolios.\nThe Company did not open any new branches in 2016, however it opened one new branch in 2015. United intends to continue to explore opportunities to expand and eliminate non-strategic branches to better posture the Company to achieve greater operational efficiencies going forward. Losses are expected in connection with establishing new branches for some time, as the expenses associated with them are largely fixed and are typically greater than the income earned at the outset as the branches build up their customer bases.\nStrong competition within United\u2019s market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense and increasing. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets.\nThe Company continues to encounter technological change. Failure to understand and keep current on technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company provides product and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or\ncircumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fraud in many aspects of the services and products that we provide.\nWe offer debit cards and credit cards to our banking customers and expanded our online banking and online account opening capabilities in 2016. Historically, we have experienced operational losses from fraud committed by third parties that obtain credentials from our customers or merchants utilized by our customers. We have little ability to manage how merchants or our banking customers protect the credentials that our customers have to transact with us. When customers and merchants do not adequately protect customer account credentials, our risks and potential costs increase. As (a) our sales of these services and products expand, (b) those who are committing fraud become more sophisticated and more determined, and (c) our banking services and product offerings expand, our operational losses could increase.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure or interruption of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure or interruption will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. A breach in security of our systems, including a breach resulting from our newer online capabilities such as mobile banking, increases the potential for fraud losses. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nWe rely on third-party relationships to conduct our business, which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance and transaction (operational) risk.\nWe rely on third party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third party relationships with vendors, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third party but remain our responsibility. Management and the Board of Directors are ultimately responsible for the activities conducted by vendors. To that end, Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing vendor relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place at United and our vendors to protect the Company and its customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.\nIncreased risk most often arises from poor planning, oversight, and control on the part of the Company and inferior performance or service on the part of the third party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third party service providers, any problems caused by third party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing third party vendors could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.\nUnited faces cybersecurity risks, including \u201cdenial of service attacks,\u201d \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft\u201d that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect United\u2019s business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nUnited\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and United may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. United may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened and as a result the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As an additional layer of protection, we have purchased network and privacy liability risk insurance coverage which includes digital asset loss, business interruption loss, network security liability, privacy liability, network extortion and data breach coverage.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, United will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and United may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches on a timely basis. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of United\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to United, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of United or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to United or to its customers, loss of confidence in United\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to United\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nMortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates which may influence secondary market spreads, and real estate and refinancing activity. In lower interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. This has the effect of increasing fee income, but could adversely impact the estimated fair value of our mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments increase. In higher interest rate environments, the demand for refinancing activity will generally be lower, and our inability to capture purchase mortgage market share may have the effect of decreasing fee income.\nIf the goodwill that the Company has recorded in connection with its mergers and acquisitions becomes impaired, it will have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nApplicable accounting standards require that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company\u2019s net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer\u2019s balance sheet as goodwill. At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $115.3 million of goodwill on its balance sheet primarily reflecting the merger with Legacy United. Companies must evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals.\nWe may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy, including through participation in FDIC-assisted acquisitions or assumption of deposits from troubled institutions. Any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, these acquisitions could involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, difficulties related to integration, difficulties and costs associated with consolidation and streamlining inefficiencies, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates, integrating acquired institutions, or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for acquisitions can be highly competitive, and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions, or if such transactions are completed, that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations. Our ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is acquired and was not underwritten by us at origination.\nAt December 31, 2016, 17.2% of our loan portfolio was acquired from our merger with Legacy United and was not underwritten by us at origination, and therefore is not necessarily reflective of our historical credit risk experience. We performed extensive credit due diligence prior to each acquisition and marked the loans to fair value upon acquisition, with such fair valuation considering expected credit losses that existed at the time of acquisition. Additionally, we evaluate the expected cash flows of\nthese loans on a quarterly basis. However, there is a risk that credit losses could be larger than currently anticipated, thus adversely affecting our earnings.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nUnited may, from time to time, implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are risks and uncertainties associated with new lines of business or new products particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. We may need to invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services. New lines of business and/or new products or services may not be implemented according to our initial schedule and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable. Other factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation of new lines of business or development of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProposed U.S. tax reforms could materially adversely affect us, including the value of our deferred tax assets.\nThe enactment of proposed U.S. tax reforms could materially adversely affect us, including a reduction in the value of our deferred tax assets upon a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate. We cannot predict if any such proposals will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what its provisions or that of the regulations promulgated thereunder will be, but they could materially adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Financial Services Industry\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, natural disasters or a combination of these or other factors.\nThere can be no assurance that national market and economic conditions will improve in the near term. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nPassage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has increased and will continue to increase our operational and compliance costs.\nOn July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). This law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The current administration has announced that it intends to slow down the adoption of new Dodd-Frank Act and regulations adopted to date. At this time, we do not expect the comments made by the new administration on regulatory posturing towards financial institutions to have an impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation processes for most all of the financial services industry. Included in the many new safeguards are increases in capital standards, imposes clearing and margining requirements on derivative activities, and increases in general oversight authority. Specific to holding companies, it increases minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements and phases out the ability to include certain securities Tier I capital.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. United Bank, as a bank with $10 billion or less in assets, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by our primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. Various parts of this legislation have yet to be implemented, and therefore we cannot be certain when final rules affecting us will be issued or to gage their potential impacts. When issued, they could have material and adverse impact on our operations; both from an increase in resource allocation for compliance as well as requiring a potential change to our business strategies. Also contained within the Dodd-Frank Act are provisions under the Volcker Rule which restrict the ability to engage in certain trading and investing activities regarding collateralized loan obligations and corporate debt obligation securities. As such, we may have to divest such investments and incur yet to be determined financial impacts on our portfolios and operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier I) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier I capital, such as trust preferred securities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The legislation also increases the required minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund, from 1.15% to 1.35% and this ratio is currently being maintained of insured deposits, and directs the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. We are generally unable to control or make advanced provision for premiums that we may be required to pay for FDIC insurance. Additional bank failures both on a local and regional level may require further increases to be absorbed by financial institutions with little advanced warning. These increase, when realized, will have a negative affect on earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments, and by authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company\u2019s proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our business may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner, as United Bank\u2019s chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of deposits, and by the Federal Reserve Board as the regulator of United Financial Bancorp, Inc. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a financial institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, and their interpretations may result with including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Inadvertent failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by the various agencies, civil money penalties and resultant reputational damage and this impact cannot be quantified.\nAny change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, may have a material impact on our operations.", "PERMNO": 90711, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "UBNK"}
