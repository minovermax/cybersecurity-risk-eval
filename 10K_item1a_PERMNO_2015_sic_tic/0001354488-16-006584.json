{"cik": "1069308", "company": "Opexa Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding to invest in our securities. The following factors affect our business, our intellectual property, the industry in which we operate and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we consider immaterial as of the date hereof may also have an adverse effect on our business. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe will be required to raise additional capital, and our ability to obtain funding is uncertain. If sufficient capital is not available, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed (including any potential study for OPX-212 in NMO and any Phase III studies of Tcelna without Merck Serono\u2019s financial support), which may require us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $12.6 million. Our operating cash burn rate during the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $1.1 million per month.\nOn March 2, 2016, we announced implementation of a restructuring initiative which included a reduction of approximately 30% of our then full-time workforce of 36 employees in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources. The restructuring initiative was driven by reduced operational demands associated with the Abili-T clinical trial for Tcelna in patients with SPMS following administration of the final dose to the last patient in such trial, which occurred in the last week of February 2016. It is intended to allow us to focus our resources on completion of the Abili-T clinical trial, for which top-line data is expected early in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our current clinical activities for the Abili-T trial of Tcelna in SPMS, to continue planned preclinical development and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 in NMO, and for general operations to sustain the Company and support such activities into the first quarter of 2017. We expect top-line data for the Abili-T trial to be available early in the fourth quarter of 2016, and thus believe we have sufficient resources to complete the trial. However, if our projections prove to be inaccurate, or if we encounter additional costs to complete the trial or to sustain our operations, or if we incur other costs such as those associated with pursuing additional disease indications for our T-cell technology or pursuing clinical development of OPX-212 in NMO following an IND filing in the absence of funding under the Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on September 1, 2015 as described below, we would need to raise additional capital to complete the Abili-T trial.\nOn September 1, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers party thereto pursuant to which we sold in tranche one of a private placement 113,636 shares of common stock for a per share purchase price of $4.40 and issued warrants to purchase a like number of shares, for a total purchase price of $499,999. We also agreed to sell and the purchasers agreed to purchase an additional aggregate of $4.5 million of common stock in four additional tranches upon our achievement of certain milestones to further the clinical development of OPX-212. On March 14, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Stock Purchase Agreement to extend the timeframes for achieving the milestones relating to the subsequent tranches. As part of the amendment, the expiration date of the Series N warrants issued to the purchasers as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement was extended from April 9, 2018 to October 9, 2018. As amended, the milestones for the subsequent tranches are as follows:\n\u25cf\nTranche 2: $1,000,000 in shares of common stock, at a per share purchase price of 90% of the 10-day volume weighted average price of the common stock for the 10 trading days (the \u201c10-day VWAP\u201d) immediately preceding the Tranche 2 milestone, which is the submission to the FDA of a preclinical study package to support the filing of an IND application for OPX-212, so long as such submission occurs on or before August 15, 2016 or any later date agreed to by the purchasers.\n\u25cf\nTranche 3: $1,500,000 in shares of common stock, at a per share purchase price of 90% of the 10-day VWAP immediately preceding the Tranche 3 milestone, which is the acceptance of such IND by the FDA, so long as such acceptance occurs on or before the later of November 15, 2016 or three months following the Tranche 2 closing, or any later date agreed to by the purchasers.\n\u25cf\nTranche 4: $1,000,000 in shares of common stock, at a per share purchase price of 90% of the 10-day VWAP immediately preceding the Tranche 4 milestone, which is the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical study of OPX-212 in patients with NMO, so long as such enrollment occurs on or before the later of February 28, 2017 or five months following the Tranche 3 closing, or any later date agreed to by the purchasers.\n\u25cf\nTranche 5: $1,000,000 in shares of common stock, at per share purchase price of 90% of the 10-day VWAP immediately preceding the Tranche 5 milestone, which is the enrollment of patients representing at least 30% of the minimum targeted enrollment in such Phase 1/2 study, so long as such enrollment occurs on or before the later of June 30, 2017 or four months following the Tranche 4 closing, or any later date agreed to by the purchasers.\nThere can be no assurance that will we achieve each of these milestones. Although we have previously indicated that an IND submission to the FDA and/or a CTA submission to Health Canada followed by commencement of a phase 1/2 proof of concept study of OPX-212 in NMO (assuming acceptance of such IND and/or CTA) may occur in the first half of 2016 assuming the availability of sufficient resources, we are currently uncertain with respect to both the pace of our ongoing preclinical development and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 in NMO as well as the potential outcome of such activities. OPX-212 in NMO remains an active preclinical program for Opexa, and we continue to believe that progress in this program is reasonably possible. However, we have been confronted with challenges in the development of OPX-212 in NMO, including with respect to the manufacture of OPX-212. For example, it has taken us longer than we expected to manufacture certain of the peptides associated with NMO due to their hydrophobic nature. We currently do not expect to provide further guidance in the foreseeable future on any timetable with respect to our development of OPX-212 in NMO, but instead to report substantive milestones only when and if they occur. While the additional proceeds anticipated to be received from the sale of the additional securities under the Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended, are anticipated to provide sufficient funding for a potential Phase 1/2 proof of concept study, assuming an IND is filed with and accepted by the FDA and that the applicable milestones under the Stock Purchase Agreement are achieved and/or such funding is otherwise available, such amounts would not be sufficient to pay our general operations during the pendency of such proof of concept study. Depending upon the specific timing for any such study, we may need to secure additional resources to support our operations during the course of such study. We may also need to secure additional resources to pay for the costs of any such study if we are unable to obtain funding under the Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended, including as a result of failing to meet the associated milestones.\nIn addition to certain other termination rights as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement, either we or the purchasers may unilaterally terminate the then remaining obligations to sell and purchase shares under one or more additional tranches upon notice if (i) we receive an aggregate of at least $20 million in gross proceeds from financing activities during the succeeding one-year period, (ii) a substantially equivalent Phase 1/2 clinical trial is initiated by a third party and such clinical trial is supported by the National Institutes of Health or its affiliated agencies or designees, or (iii) any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of our capital stock or upon sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, any then remaining obligations we may have to sell, and of the purchasers to purchase, shares under one or more additional tranches are automatically terminated if the next potential issuance would entail an amount which, when aggregated with all prior issuances to the purchasers under the agreement plus the shares of common stock issued or issuable under the warrant, would exceed 1,328,020 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. The obligation of the purchasers to purchase any additional shares is suspended if we do not have sufficient shares of common stock available in respect of the remaining purchase obligations, and the purchasers may terminate any then remaining obligations if there is an uncured material breach of the agreement by Opexa.\nGiven our need for additional amounts of capital to support our current business plan, we intend to continue to explore potential opportunities and alternatives to obtain additional resources, including one or more additional financing transactions. There can be no assurance that any such financings or potential opportunities and alternatives can be consummated on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funding to support our current clinical trial activities and operations beyond the projected runway, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed, which may require us to suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials (including the Abili-T clinical study) or any other development activities (such as our preclinical development and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 in NMO), modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws. In such event, our shareholders may lose a portion or even all of their investment.\nWe do not maintain any external lines of credit or have any sources of debt or equity capital committed for funding, other than our at-the-market program and the September 1, 2015 Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended, which may result in our sale of an additional $4.5 million in shares of common stock, subject to achievement of certain milestones to further the clinical development of OPX-212. Should we need any additional capital in the future beyond these sources, management will be reliant upon \u201cbest efforts\u201d debt or equity financings. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any funding effort. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing;\n\u25cf\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for capital needs in 2015 and beyond as well as for the clinical study of Tcelna and OPX-212;\n\u25cf\nscientific progress in our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nthe magnitude and scope of our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nour progress with preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and\n\u25cf\nthe number and type of product candidates that we pursue.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, shareholders may experience substantial dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impede our ability to operate our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. There is no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations.\nWe may make changes to discretionary R&D investments that may have an impact on costs.\nWe are presently complementing the Abili-T clinical trial with an immune monitoring program. Expenses associated with the immune monitoring program are incurred at our discretion and are not required to satisfy any FDA-mandated criteria. Consequently, we may make changes to the parameters that are being analyzed, and these changes may result in either increased or decreased expenses for the study.\nWe may also incur discretionary expenses related to Phase I, Phase II and/or Phase III development programs, manufacturing scale-up/automation and technology transfer, research on additional indications and business development activities. There is no assurance that any such future expenses would be recovered by us.\nFunding from our ATM facility may be limited or be insufficient to fund our operations or to implement our strategy.\nWe will need to keep current our shelf registration statement and the offering prospectus relating to our at-the-market (ATM) sales agreement with Brinson Patrick (now a division of IFS Securities, Inc.) in order to use the program to sell shares of our common stock. The number of shares and price at which we may be able to sell shares under our ATM facility may be limited due to market conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWe have a history of operating losses and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not generated any profits since our entry into the biotechnology business and we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. We have not received, and we do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, any revenues from the commercializ\u00adation of any potential products. We do not currently have any sources of revenues and may not have any in the foreseeable future.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, Tcelna, and we cannot be certain that Tcelna will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. We do not have any product candidates that have completed late-stage clinical trials nor do we have any products on the market. We have only one product candidate, Tcelna, which has progressed to the stage of being studied in human clinical trials in the United States. Additionally, our second pipeline candidate, OPX-212 is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of NMO. Tcelna, and any other potential products, including OPX-212, will require regulatory approval prior to marketing in the United States and other countries. Obtaining such approval requires significant research and development and preclinical and clinical testing. We may not be able to develop any products, to obtain regulatory approvals, to continue clinical development of Tcelna, to enter clinical trials (or any development activities) for any other product candidates (such as OPX-212) or to commercialize any products. Tcelna, and any other potential products (such as OPX-212), may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety, efficacy or cost-effectiveness that could prevent or limit their use. Any product using any of our technology may fail to provide the intended therapeutic benefits or to achieve therapeutic benefits equal to or better than the standard of treatment at the time of testing or production.\nWe have provided Merck Serono with the Option, which provides Merck Serono with the opportunity, if exercised, to control the development and commercialization of Tcelna in MS.\nIn February 2013, we granted the Option to Merck Serono. The Option permits Merck Serono to acquire an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan) license of our Tcelna program for the treatment of MS. The Option may be exercised by Merck Serono prior to or upon completion of our ongoing Phase IIb trial of Tcelna in patients with SPMS. If Merck Serono exercises the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates. We would also retain rights to Tcelna in Japan, certain rights with respect to the manufacture of Tcelna, and rights outside of MS. In consideration for the Option, we received an upfront payment of $5 million and may be eligible to receive an option exercise fee as well as milestone and royalty payments based on achievement of development and commercialization milestones. The rights we have relinquished to our product candidate Tcelna, including development and commercialization rights, may harm our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability. On March 9, 2015, we entered into the Merck Serono Amendment pursuant to which we agreed to perform additional development activities in preparation for a potential Phase III trial and to share with Merck Serono certain information from our immune monitoring program in consideration for payment by Merck Serono of $3 million.\nIf Merck Serono exercises the Option, we would become reliant on Merck Serono\u2019s resources and efforts with respect to Tcelna in MS, including the pace at which it moves forward with commencement of any Phase III study. In such an event, Merck Serono may fail to develop or effectively commercialize Tcelna for a variety of reasons, including that Merck Serono:\n\u25cf\ndoes not have sufficient resources or decides not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as limited cash or human resources;\n\u25cf\ndecides to pursue a competitive potential product;\n\u25cf\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\ndetermines that the market opportunity is not attractive; or\n\u25cf\ncannot manufacture or obtain the necessary materials in sufficient quantities from multiple sources or at a reasonable cost.\nIf Merck Serono does not exercise the Option, we may be unable to enter into a collaboration with any other potential partner on acceptable terms, if at all. We face competition in our search for partners from other organizations worldwide, many of whom are larger and are able to offer more attractive deals in terms of financial commitments, contribution of human resources, or development, manufacturing, regulatory or commercial expertise and support.\nIf Merck Serono does not exercise the Option, and we are not successful in attracting another partner and entering into collaboration on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete development of or commercialize any product candidate, including Tcelna. In such event, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability would be significantly hindered and we may not be able to continue operations as proposed, requiring us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations or cease operations.\nWe will need regulatory approvals for any product candidate, including Tcelna, prior to introduction to the market, which will require successful testing in clinical trials. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, and are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. Any product candidate, such as Tcelna, may fail to achieve necessary safety and efficacy endpoints during clinical trials in which case we will be unable to generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our products.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous FDA requirements, and must otherwise comply with federal, state and local requirements and policies of the medical institutions where they are conducted. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We reached our enrollment target for the Abili-T trial in June 2014, and a total of 190 patients have been enrolled in this two-year study. We expect top-line data for Tcelna to be available early in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, we anticipate that at least a pivotal Phase III clinical trial would be necessary before an application could be submitted for approval of Tcelna for SPMS. Failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and problems could be encountered that would cause us or Merck Serono (in the event the Option is exercised) to be unable to initiate a trial, or to abandon or repeat a clinical trial.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials, including the continuation and completion of the Phase IIb clinical trial of Tcelna in SPMS, may be delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nFDA or IRB objection to proposed protocols;\n\u25cf\ndiscussions or disagreement with the FDA over the adequacy of trial design to potentially demonstrate effectiveness, and subsequent design modifications;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf\ndetermination of dosing issues, epitope profiles, and related adjustments;\n\u25cf\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf\nproduct quality problems (e.g., sterility or purity);\n\u25cf\nchallenges to patient monitoring, retention and data collection during or after treatment (e.g., patients\u2019 failure to return for follow-up visits or to complete the trial, detection of epitope profiles in subsequent visits, etc.); and\n\u25cf\nfailure of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we, Merck Serono with respect to Tcelna (if the Option is exercised) or the FDA (based on its authority over clinical studies) may delay a proposed investigation or suspend clinical trials in progress at any time if it appears that the study may pose significant risks to the study participants or other serious deficiencies are identified. Prior to approval of any product candidate, the FDA must determine that the data demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The large majority of drug candidates that begin human clinical trials fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy characteristics.\nFurthermore, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols, or otherwise modify our intended course of clinical development, to reflect these changes. This, too, may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. In light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products, and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for any product candidate, such as Tcelna, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any potential products, whether directly or through any development arrangement (such as where Merck Serono exercises the Option), will be limited by any failure to obtain or limitation on necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf Merck Serono exercises the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that may hamper our ability to successfully develop and commercialize any product candidate, including Tcelna.\nAlthough we have participated in the design and management of our past clinical trials, we do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials directly for any product candidate, including Tcelna. We will need to rely on contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials and to perform data collection and analysis, including the Phase IIb trial of Tcelna in patients with SPMS.\nOur clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated if:\n\u25cf\nany third party upon whom we rely does not successfully carry out its contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines;\n\u25cf\nlicenses needed from third parties for manufacturing in order to conduct Phase III trials or to conduct commercial manufacturing, if applicable, are not obtained;\n\u25cf\nany such third party needs to be replaced; or\n\u25cf\nthe quality or accuracy of the data obtained by the third party is compromised due to its failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons.\nFailure to perform by any third party upon whom we rely may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and prevent the commercialization of any product candidate, including Tcelna. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, we might not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without delays or additional expenditures if we were to seek such alternative sources.\nIf we fail to identify and license or acquire other product candidates, we will not be able to expand our business over the long term.\nWe have focused on MS as the first disease to be pursued off our T-cell platform technology, and last year, we announced the initiation of NMO as the second disease we are pursuing. As a platform technology, there exists the potential to address other autoimmune diseases with the technology. Early development activities including preclinical development and manufacturing activities have been initiated in OPX-212. The work in NMO is modest compared to the effort that has been committed to the lead MS indication. Our business over the long term is substantially dependent on our ability to develop, license or acquire product candidates and further develop them for commercialization. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to expand our existing platform or identify, select and acquire the right product candidates. We have limited experience identifying, negotiating and implementing economically viable product candidate acquisitions or licenses, which is a lengthy and complex process. Also, the market for licensing and acquiring product candidates is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We may not have the requisite capital resources to consummate product candidate acquisitions or licenses that we identify to fulfill our strategy.\nMoreover, any product candidate acquisition that we do complete will involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating the development program for the acquired product candidate into our existing operations;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering new potential markets or technologies;\n\u25cf\ninability to generate sufficient funding to offset acquisition costs; and\n\u25cf\ndelays that may result from our having to perform unanticipated preclinical trials or other tests on the product candidate.\nWe are dependent upon our management team and a small number of employees, and our recent restructuring initiative may cause disruption or not achieve the savings anticipated.\nOur business strategy is dependent upon the skills and knowledge of our management team. If any critical employee leaves, we may be unable on a timely basis to hire suitable replacements to operate our business effectively. We also operate with a very small number of employees and thus have little or no backup capability for their activities. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or the loss of just a few other employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. On March 2, 2016, we announced implementation of a restructuring initiative which included a reduction of approximately 30% of our then full-time workforce of 36 employees, including our chief financial officer, in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources. The restructuring initiative was driven by reduced operational demands associated with the Abili-T clinical trial for Tcelna in patients with SPMS following administration of the final dose to the last patient in such trial, which occurred in the last week of February 2016. It is intended to allow us to focus our resources on completion of the Abili-T clinical trial, for which top-line data is expected early in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, the restructuring initiative may cause disruption to our business operations, and we may not be able to effectively realize the savings anticipated by the restructuring initiative and reduction-in-force. Additionally, there may be future possible changes in our workforce, including as a result of changes that may occur in our operations or operating plan, or other reasons or events. There may also be possible changes in the amount of charges and cash payments associated with the workforce reduction which occurred on March 2, 2016 or the retention plan we initiated for our continuing non-management employees as of that date, including the possibility that we may incur unanticipated charges or make cash payments that are not currently contemplated.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under our license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business depends on licenses from third parties. These third party license agreements impose obligations on us, such as payment obligations and obligations diligently to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents. We may also need to seek additional licenses as we move into Phase III trials and, if applicable, the commercial stage of operations. These licenses may require increased payments to the licensors. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform could be adversely affected.\nOur research and manufacturing facility is not large enough to manufacture product candidates, such as Tcelna, for certain clinical trials or, if such clinical trials are successful, commercial applications.\nWe conduct our research and development in a 10,200 square foot facility in The Woodlands, Texas, which includes an approximately 1,200 square foot suite of three rooms for the manufacture of T-cell therapies. We believe our facility should have the capacity to support full clinical development of Tcelna in North American trials for SPMS and, if applicable, a potential Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO. It is not sufficient, however, to support clinical trials outside North America including Europe and Asia, if required, or the commercial launch of Tcelna or any other product candidate. In this case, we would need to expand our manufacturing staff and facility, obtain a new facility, contract with corporate collaborators or other third parties to assist with future drug production and commercialization, or defer to Merck Serono (in the event the Option is exercised) to address manufacturing requirements.\nIn the event that we decide to establish a commercial-scale manufacturing facility, we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with applicable regulations, which are extensive. We do not have funds available for building a manufacturing facility, and we may not be able to build a manufacturing facility that both meets regulatory requirements and is sufficient for our commercial-scale manufacturing.\nWe may arrange with third parties for the manufacture of our future products, if any. However, our third-party sourcing strategy may not result in a cost-effective means for manufacturing our future products. If we employ third-party manufacturers, we will not control many aspects of the manufacturing process, including compliance by these third parties with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. We further may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from third-party manufacturers in a timely fashion for development or commercialization purposes, and commercial quantities of products may not be available from contract manufacturers at acceptable costs.\nProblems with our manufacturing process or with a manufacturing facility (whether ours or a third party\u2019s) could result in the failure to produce, or a delay in producing, adequate supplies of a product candidate such as Tcelna. A number of factors could cause interruptions or delays, including equipment malfunctions or failures, destruction or damage to a manufacturing facility due to natural disasters or otherwise, contamination of materials, changes in regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our manufacturing process, action by a regulatory agency or by a manufacturer (whether us or a third party) that results in the halting or slowdown of production due to regulatory issues, any third-party manufacturer going out of business or failing to produce as contractually required, or other similar factors.\nDifficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacture and supply of a product candidate such as Tcelna could require us to stop treating patients in our clinical development of such product candidate and/or require a halt to or suspension of, or otherwise adversely affect, a clinical trial, thus increasing our costs and damaging our reputation. If a product candidate such as Tcelna is approved, difficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacture and supply of such product candidate could cause a delay in or even halt or suspend the commercialization of such product candidate, potentially causing a partial or complete loss of revenue or market share.\nTcelna is manufactured using our proprietary ImmPath\u00ae technology for the production of an autologous T-cell immunotherapy utilizing a patient\u2019s own blood. Our manufacturing process may raise development issues that may not be resolvable, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or personnel issues that may prevent the further development or commercialization, if approved, of any product candidate such as Tcelna.\nTcelna is based on our novel T-cell immunotherapy platform, ImmPath, which produces an autologous T-cell immunotherapy utilizing a patient\u2019s own blood. OPX-212 is expected to be similarly produced. The manufacture of living T-cell products requires specialized facilities, equipment and personnel which are different than the resources required for manufacturing chemical or biologic compounds. Scaling-out the manufacture of living cell products to meet demands for commercialization will require substantial amounts of such specialized facilities, equipment and personnel, especially where, as is the case for Tcelna and expected to be the case for OPX-212, the products are personalized and must be made for each patient individually. Because our manufacturing processes are complex, require facilities and personnel that are not widely available in the industry, involve equipment and training with long lead times, and the establishment of new manufacturing facilities is subject to a potentially lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or on reasonably terms, if at all. In addition, not many consultants or advisors in the industry have relevant experience and can provide guidance or assistance because active immune therapies such as Tcelna are fundamentally a new category of product in two major ways: (i) the product consists of living T-cells, not chemical or biologic compounds; and (ii) the product is personalized. There can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not arise in the future which we may not be able to resolve or which may cause significant delays in development or, if any product candidate such as Tcelna is approved, commercialization.\nRegulatory approval of product candidates such as Tcelna that are manufactured using novel manufacturing processes such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to a lack of experience with them. FDA approval of personalized immunotherapy products has been limited to date. This lack of experience and precedent may lengthen the regulatory review process, require that additional studies or clinical trials be conducted, increase development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions.\nIn addition, the novel nature of product candidates such as Tcelna also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel for research, development and manufacturing positions.\nIf any product we may eventually have is not accepted by the market or if users of any such product are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for such product from government and other third-party payors, our revenues and profitability will suffer.\nIn the instance of Tcelna, if Merck Serono exercises the Option then our ability to achieve revenue will be dependent upon the efforts and success of Merck Serono in developing and commercializing Tcelna. Our ability to successfully commercialize any product we may eventually have, to the extent applicable, and/or our ability to receive any revenue associated with Tcelna in the event Merck Serono exercises the Option, will depend in significant part on the extent to which appropriate coverage of and reimbursement for such product and any related treatments are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party payors will consider any product cost-effective or provide coverage of and reimbursement for such product, in whole or in part.\nUncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services and newly approved indications for existing products. Third-party payors may conclude that any product is less safe, less clinically effective, or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not approve such product for coverage and reimbursement. If adequate coverage of and reimbursement for any product from third-party payors cannot be obtained, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. Such reduction or limitation in the use of any such product would cause sales to suffer. Even if third-party payors make reimbursement available, payment levels may not be sufficient to make the sale of any such product profitable.\nIn addition, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of medical services and products, may result in inadequate coverage of and reimbursement for any product we may eventually have. Many third-party payors, including in particular HMOs, are pursuing various ways to reduce pharmaceutical costs, including, for instance, the use of formularies. The market for any product depends on access to such formularies, which are lists of medications for which third-party payors provide reimbursement. These formularies are increasingly restricted, and pharmaceutical companies face significant competition in their efforts to place their products on formularies of HMOs and other third-party payors. This increased competition has led to a downward pricing pressure in the industry. The cost containment measures that third-party payors are instituting could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.\nAny product candidate, such as Tcelna, if approved for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues.\nEven if a product candidate, such as Tcelna, is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors, and our profitability and growth, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndemonstration of efficacy;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\navailability and cost of alternative treatments, including cheaper generic drugs;\n\u25cf\npricing and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of sales and marketing strategies for the product and competition for such product;\n\u25cf\nthe product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from that product candidate would be substantially reduced.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ). Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to conclude an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required or we or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. In addition, our registered public accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our Board committees and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nUnder the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ, a majority of our Board of Directors and each member of our Audit and Compensation Committees must be an independent director. If any vacancies on our Board or our Audit or Compensation Committees occur that need to be filled by independent directors, we may encounter difficulty in attracting qualified persons to serve on our Board and, in particular, our Audit Committee. If we fail to attract and retain the required number of independent directors, we may be subject to SEC enforcement proceedings and delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAny acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies on a global geographic footprint. We may also consider joint ventures, licensing and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert our management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We do not have any experience with acquiring companies, or with acquiring products outside of the United States. Any cash acquisition we pursue would potentially divert the cash we have on our balance sheet from our present clinical development programs. Any stock acquisitions would dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership. While we from time to time evaluate potential collaborative projects and acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or collaborative projects.\nWe plan to do business internationally, which may prove to be difficult and fraught with economic, regulatory and political issues.\nWe may acquire or in-license foreign companies or technologies or commercialize our T-cell or stem cell platform in countries where the business, economic and political climates are very different from those of the United States. We may not be aware of some of these issues and it may be difficult for a U.S. company to overcome these issues and ultimately become profitable. Certain foreign countries may favor businesses that are owned by nationals of those countries as opposed to foreign-owned business operating locally. As a small company, we may not have the resources to engage in the negotiation and time-consuming work needed to overcome some of these potential issues.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nPatents obtained by other persons may result in infringement claims against us that are costly to defend and which may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products, such as Tcelna.\nIf third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by either our licensed technology or other technology required to make or use our potential products, such as Tcelna, and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, we (or, in the event the Option is exercised, Merck Serono with respect to Tcelna) may not be able to develop any affected product candidate commercially. There can be no assurance that we will not be obliged to defend ourselves (or, in the event the Option is exercised, Merck Serono with respect to Tcelna) in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents. Patent litigation is very expensive and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. An adverse outcome in such a suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent protection and other proprietary rights, our operations will be significantly harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent upon obtaining patent protection relating to our technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced before or after the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether pending patent applications for our technology will result in the issuance of patents, or if any issued patents will provide significant protection or commercial advantage or will be circumvented by others. Since patent applications are secret until the applications are published (usually 18 months after the earliest effective filing date), and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that the inventors of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights were the first to make the inventions at issue or that any patent applications at issue were the first to be filed for such inventions. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending patent applications or, if issued, that such patents will be of commercial benefit to us, afford us adequate protection from competing products, or not be challenged or declared invalid.\nIssued U.S. patents require the payment of maintenance fees to continue to be in force. We rely on a third party payor to do this and their failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of patents not timely maintained. Many foreign patent offices also require the payment of periodic annuities to keep patents and patent applications in good standing. As we may not maintain direct control over the payment of all such annuities, we cannot assure you that our third party payor will timely pay such annuities and that the granted patents and pending patent applications will not become abandoned. In addition, we or our licensors may have selected a limited amount of foreign patent protection, and therefore applications have not been filed in, and foreign patents may not have been perfected in, all commercially significant countries.\nThe patent protection of product candidates, such as Tcelna, involves complex legal and factual questions. To the extent that it would be necessary or advantageous for any of our licensors to cooperate or lead in the enforcement of our licensed intellectual property rights, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources such licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on enforcing such rights. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against third party infringement, which may be difficult to detect. Additionally, challenges may be made to the ownership of our intellectual property rights, our ability to enforce them, or our underlying licenses.\nWe cannot be certain that any of the patents issued to us or to our licensors will provide adequate protection from competing products. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we or our licensors can:\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain patents to protect our product candidates such as Tcelna;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain any required or desirable licenses to use certain technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents;\n\u25cf\nprotect our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf\noperate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others;\n\u25cf\nenforce the issued patents under which we hold rights; and\n\u25cf\ndevelop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights (owned or licensed) is uncertain. For example:\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensor might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents owned by, or licensed to, us;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensor might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of the technologies owned by, or licensed to, us;\n\u25cf\nit is possible that none of the pending patent applications owned by, or licensed to, us will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nany patents under which we hold rights may not provide us with a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties as invalid, or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws; or\n\u25cf\nany of the issued patents under which we hold rights may not be valid or enforceable or may be circumvented successfully in light of the continuing evolution of domestic and foreign patent laws.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Further, we have limited control, if any, over the protection of trade secrets developed by our licensors. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nA number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have been issued patents relating to cell therapy, T-cells, and other technologies potentially relevant to or required by our product candidates such as Tcelna. We cannot predict which, if any, of such applications will issue as patents or the claims that might be allowed. We are aware of a number of patent applications and patents claiming use of modified cells to treat disease, disorder or injury.\nThere is significant litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates, such as Tcelna, or their methods of use, manufacturing or other technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. If our product candidates, such as Tcelna, or their methods of manufacture are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses under such patents. We have not conducted comprehensive searches of patents issued to third parties relating to Tcelna or OPX-212. Consequently, no assurance can be given that third-party patents containing claims covering Tcelna or OPX-212, their methods of use or manufacture do not exist or have not been filed and will not be issued in the future. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, and because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications that will mature into issued patents that relate to our current or future product candidates that could have a material effect in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates. A patent holder could prevent us from importing, making, using or selling the patented compounds. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Similarly, we may be subject to claims that we have inappropriately used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u25cf\npayment of actual damages, royalties, lost profits, potentially treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u25cf\ninjunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell our products;\n\u25cf\nwe or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all; or\n\u25cf\nsignificant cost and expense, as well as distraction of our management from our business.\nAs a result, we could be prevented from commercializing current or future product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to stringent regulation of our product candidates, such as Tcelna, which could delay development and commercialization.\nWe, our third-party contractors, suppliers and partners (such as Merck Serono, in the event the Option is exercised, with respect to Tcelna), and our product candidates, such as Tcelna, are subject to stringent regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. None of our product candidates can be marketed in the United States until it has been approved by the FDA. No product candidate of ours has been approved, and we may never receive FDA approval for any product candidate. Obtaining FDA approval typically takes many years and requires substantial resources. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use and labeling of such products. Additionally, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. These regulatory requirements may limit the size of the market for the product or result in the incurrence of additional costs. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could substantially reduce our ability to generate revenues.\nIn addition, both before and after regulatory approval, we, our partners and our product candidates, such as Tcelna, are subject to numerous FDA requirements covering, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and export. The FDA\u2019s requirements may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that could affect us, our partners and our product candidates, such as Tcelna. Given the number of recent high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk management programs, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. Furthermore, heightened Congressional scrutiny on the adequacy of the FDA\u2019s drug approval process and the agency\u2019s efforts to assure the safety of marketed drugs resulted in the enactment of legislation addressing drug safety issues, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. This legislation provides the FDA with expanded authority over drug products after approval and the FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, and increased costs to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from this or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nIn order to market any of our products outside of the United States, we and our strategic partners and licensees must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods and the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. Approval by the FDA does not automatically lead to the approval of authorities outside of the United States and, similarly, approval by other regulatory authorities outside the United States will not automatically lead to FDA approval. In addition, regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Our product candidates, such as Tcelna, may not be approved for all indications that we request, which would limit uses and adversely impact our potential royalties and product sales. Such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which any potential product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries, among other things, we may be subject to fines and other civil penalties, delays in approving or failure to approve a product, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials, injunctions and criminal prosecution, any of which would harm our business.\nWe may need to change our business practices to comply with health care fraud and abuse regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Merck Serono exercises the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates. Otherwise, if we are successful in achieving approval to market one or more of our product candidates, our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations, known as the \u201csafe harbors.\u201d These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, sometimes known as \u201crelators\u201d or, more commonly, as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nIn addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.\nBeginning August 1, 2013, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the \u201cSunshine Act\u201d), which is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals or medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and items of value given to U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals (defined as \u201cCovered Recipients\u201d). The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by the 90th day of each subsequent year.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our product candidates, they may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunities.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the market for MS products, is intense, and we expect such competition to continue to increase. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, in the United States and abroad. Our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may succeed in developing drugs that are more effective, safer and more affordable or more easily administered than ours, or that achieve patent protection or commercialization sooner than our products. Our most significant competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies. These companies have significantly greater capital resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing than we currently do. However, smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. In addition to the competitors with existing products that have been approved, many of our competitors are further along in the process of product development and also operate large, company-funded research and development programs. As a result, our competitors may develop more competitive or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or further product commercialization than we are able to achieve. Competitive products may render any products or product candidates that we develop obsolete.\nOur competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any products that we may develop.\nRapid technological change could make our products obsolete.\nBiopharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change, and we expect that they will continue to do so. As a result, there is significant risk that our product candidates, such as Tcelna, may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by new discoveries before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development. If our product candidates, such as Tcelna, are rendered obsolete by advancements in biopharmaceutical technologies, our future prospects will suffer.\nConsumers may sue us for product liability, which could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our available resources and damage our reputation.\nDeveloping and commercializing drug products entails significant product liability risks. Liability claims may arise from our and our collaborators\u2019 use of products in clinical trials and the commercial sale of those products.\nIn the event that any of our product candidates becomes an approved product and is commercialized, consumers may make product liability claims directly against us and/or our partners (such as Merck Serono, in the event the Option is exercised, with respect to Tcelna), and our partners or others selling these products may seek contribution from us if they incur any loss or expenses related to such claims. We have insurance that covers clinical trial activities. We believe our insurance coverage as of the date hereof is reasonably adequate at this time. However, we will need to increase and expand this coverage as we commence additional clinical trials, as well as larger scale trials, and if any product candidate is approved for commercial sale. This insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the regulatory approval or commercialization of products that we or one of our collaborators develop. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Liability from such claims could exceed our total assets if we do not prevail in any lawsuit brought by a third party alleging that an injury was caused by one or more of our products.\nGovernment controls and health care reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. In the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system. For example, in some foreign countries, particularly in Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of any product candidate, such as Tcelna, to other available therapies. If reimbursement of any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in such country. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. Any negotiated prices for any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved, covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices that might otherwise be obtained outside of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Moreover, while Medicare Part D applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment under Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.\nThe United States and several other jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved. Among policy-makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect: the demand for any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved; the ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved; our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and the availability of capital.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), became law in the United States. The goal of the ACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved. Provisions of the ACA relevant to the pharmaceutical industry include the following: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts on negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability; expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations; and expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.\nAnother example of reform that could affect our business is drug reimportation into the United States (i.e., the reimportation of approved drugs originally manufactured in the United States back into the United States from other countries where the drugs were sold at lower prices). Initiatives in this regard could decrease the price we or any potential collaborators receive for our product candidates if they are ever approved for sale, adversely affecting our future revenue growth and potential profitability. Moreover, the pendency or approval of such proposals could result in a decrease in our stock price or adversely affect our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic partnerships or licenses.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThere is currently a limited market for our securities, and any trading market that exists in our securities may be highly illiquid and may not reflect the underlying value of our net assets or business prospects.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there is currently a limited market for our securities and there can be no assurance that an active market will ever develop. Investors are cautioned not to rely on the possibility that an active trading market may develop.\nOur stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which could affect its market price and liquidity.\nWe are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests (including a minimum bid price for our common stock of $1.00 per share and a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million), as well as certain corporate governance standards, to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. We received a staff deficiency letter in December 2014 indicating that our common stock failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement because it traded below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price for 30 consecutive trading days, and after an initial and an extended grace period, and implementation of a one-for-eight reverse stock split of our common stock on September 28, 2015, we regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price listing standard and NASDAQ notified us that the matter was closed on October 14, 2015. However, there is no assurance that the closing bid price of our common stock will continue to stay above the minimum continued listing standard.\nWe previously received a similar staff deficiency letter in February 2012 indicating that our common stock failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement because it traded below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price for 30 consecutive trading days, and after an initial and an extended grace period, and implementation of a one-for-four reverse stock split of our common stock on December 14, 2012, we regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price listing standard and NASDAQ notified us that the matter was closed in January 2013. We also received a staff deficiency letter in November 2012 notifying us that the stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,339,285 as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 was below the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million required for continued listing on NASDAQ. We were provided 45 calendar days, or until January 10, 2013, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity standard. We submitted such a plan and it was accepted, with NASDAQ thus granting us an extension until May 15, 2013 to evidence compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity standard. Upon executing the plan, we attained the necessary stockholders\u2019 equity level and subsequently received notice from NASDAQ that we had regained compliance with the listing standard and the matter was closed in May 2013.\nWhile we are exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price, stockholder\u2019s equity or other listing standards in the future. We may receive additional future notices from NASDAQ that we have failed to meet its requirements, and proceedings to delist our stock could be commenced. In such event, NASDAQ rules permit us to appeal any delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel. If we are unable to maintain or regain compliance in a timely manner and our common stock is delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our common stock and obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting may also impair our ability to raise capital.\nOur share price is volatile, and you may not be able to resell our shares at a profit or at all.\nThe market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and early-stage drug discovery and development companies like us in particular, have historically been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nthe development status of any drug candidates, such as Tcelna, including clinical study results and determinations by regulatory authorities with respect thereto;\n\u25cf\nthe initiation, termination, or reduction in the scope of any collaboration arrangements (such as developments involving Merck Serono and the Option, including a decision by Merck Serono to exercise or not exercise the Option) or any disputes or developments regarding such collaborations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products or other material events by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments concerning our proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nchanges in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations of our financial performance;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ndiscussions of our business, products, financial performance, prospects or stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities;\n\u25cf\npublic concern as to, and legislative action with respect to, the pricing and availability of prescription drugs or the safety of drugs and drug delivery techniques;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and in foreign countries; or\n\u25cf\ndilutive effects of sales of shares of common stock by us or our shareholders, and sales of common stock acquired upon exercise or conversion by the holders of warrants, options or convertible notes.\nBroad market and industry factors, as well as economic and political factors, also may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be or become the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities or the reporting of unfavorable news, security holders have often instituted class action litigation. If the market value of our securities experience adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to suffer.\nOur \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock could be issued to prevent a business combination not desired by management or our majority shareholders.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval. Our preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in our control and as a method of preventing shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares in connection with a change of control.\nFuture sales of our securities could cause dilution, and the sale of such securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall.\nFrom March 5, 2014 through December 31, 2015, we generated gross and net proceeds including amortization of deferred financing costs of $1,397,902 and $1,335,001, respectively, on sales of an aggregate 254,308 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market facility. In April 2015, we raised $13,804,140 in gross proceeds, before expenses, through subscriptions for 3,137,305 units in a Rights Offering to holders of our common stock and holders of our outstanding Series L warrants who were entitled to participate. Each unit was composed of common stock and a Series M warrant to purchase additional common stock. The Rights Offering was completed on April 9, 2015. We issued an aggregate of 3,137,305 shares of common stock and Series M warrants to purchase a like number of shares. Net proceeds, after deduction of fees and expenses, including dealer-manager fees, were $12.1 million. On September 1, 2015, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers party thereto pursuant to which we sold in tranche one of a private placement 113,636 shares of common stock for a per share purchase price of $4.40 and issued Series N warrants to purchase a like number of shares, for a total purchase price of $499,999. We also agreed to sell and the purchasers agreed to purchase an additional aggregate of $4.5 million of common stock in four additional tranches upon our achievement of certain milestones to further the clinical development of OPX-212. We also granted the purchasers certain registration rights with respect to the securities sold in the September 1, 2015 private placement transaction. This Stock Purchase Agreement was amended on March 14, 2016 to extend by six months the timeframes for achieving the milestones relating to funding under subsequent tranches and to extend by six months the expiration date for the Series N warrants issued to the purchasers.\nSales of additional shares of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. An aggregate of 6,982,909 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2015. As of such date, another (i) 417,404 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and (ii) 3,662,954 shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. A substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and warrants (as well as a substantial majority of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants) are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, to finance future acquisitions. We may need to raise additional capital in order to initiate or complete additional development activities for OPX-212 in NMO, or to pursue additional disease indications for our T-cell technology, and this may require us to issue a substantial amount of securities (including common stock as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock). There can be no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations. Moreover, we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or securing funds to complete our clinical trial plans, or the perception that such sales could occur, may result in substantial dilution and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe presently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on the common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance the future expansion of our business.\nOur shareholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nOur charter allows us to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of our common stock and to issue and designate the rights of, without shareholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by other investors, and dilution to our shareholders could result. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by other investors.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, guarantees, preferred stock, hybrid securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive distributions of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may be influenced by market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nOur management has significant flexibility in using our current available cash.\nIn addition to general corporate purposes (including working capital, research and development, business development and operational purposes), we currently intend to use our available cash (i) to continue funding the ongoing Abili-T clinical study of Tcelna in patients with SPMS, and (ii) to continue preclinical and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 in patients with NMO, and if such activities are successful, to file an IND application with the FDA to initiate a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study. We reached our enrollment target for the Abili-T trial in June 2014, and a total of 190 patients have been enrolled in this two-year study. We expect top-line data for Tcelna to be available early in the fourth quarter of 2016. While we believe we have sufficient resources to complete the trial and support our operations during the pendency of the trial, if our projections prove to be inaccurate or we encounter additional costs to complete the trial or to sustain our operations, we may need to raise additional capital or modify either the Abili-T clinical study, our development of OPX-212 in NMO, or other aspects of our current business plan.\nDepending on future developments and circumstances, we may use some of our available cash for other purposes which may have the potential to decrease the forecasted cash runway. Notwithstanding our current intentions regarding use of our available cash, our management will have significant flexibility with respect to such use. The actual amounts and timing of expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of cash used in our operations and our research and development efforts. Management\u2019s failure to use these funds effectively would have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock and could make it more difficult and costly to raise funds in the future.\nAn active trading market may never develop for the Series M warrants issued in the Rights Offering, which may limit the ability to resell the warrants.\nThere is no established trading market for the Series M warrants we issued in April 2015 pursuant to the Rights Offering. While the warrants have been listed for trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cOPXAW,\u201d there can be no assurance that that a market will develop for the warrants. Even if a market for the warrants does develop, the price of the warrants may fluctuate and liquidity may be limited. If a market for the warrants does not develop, then holders of the warrants may be unable to resell the warrants or be able to sell them only at an unfavorable price for an extended period of time, if at all. Future trading prices of the warrants will depend on many factors, including our operating performance and financial condition, our ability to continue the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the warrants and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, the interest of securities dealers in making a market and the market for similar securities.\nThe market price of our common stock may not exceed the exercise price of the Series M warrants issued in connection with the Rights Offering.\nThe Series M warrants issued in April 2015 in connection with the Rights Offering will expire on April 9, 2018. The warrants entitle the holders to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of (i) $4.00 per share from the date of issuance through June 30, 2016 and (ii) $12.00 per share from July 1, 2016 through their expiration three years from the date of issuance. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will exceed the exercise price of the warrants at any or all times prior to their expiration. Any warrants not exercised by their expiration date will expire worthless and we will be under no further obligation to the warrant holder.\nThe Series M warrants issued in connection with the Rights Offering may be redeemed on short notice. This may have an adverse impact on their price.\nWe may redeem the Series M warrants issued in the Rights Offering for $0.01 per warrant once the closing price of our common stock has equaled or exceeded $20.00 per share, subject to adjustment, for 10 consecutive trading days. If we give notice of redemption, holders will be forced to sell or exercise their warrants or accept the redemption price. The notice of redemption could come at a time when it is not advisable or possible to exercise the warrants. As a result, holders would be unable to benefit from owning the warrants being redeemed.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for federal income tax purposes of approximately $70 million. These NOLs are generally carried forward to reduce taxable income in future years. If unused, the NOLs will begin to expire December 31, 2025. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue code.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our stock on the date of the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carryforwards.\nThe rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. As a result of our numerous capital raises, which have included the issuance of various classes of convertible securities and warrants, uncertainty exists as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past or will undergo one as a result of the recently completed Rights Offering. Even if the Rights Offering does not cause an ownership change, it may increase the likelihood that we may undergo an ownership change in the future. Based on our recent stock prices, we believe any ownership change would severely limit our ability to utilize the NOLs. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOL carryforward amounts could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOL carryforward amounts to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the expected benefit to us. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOL carryforward amounts before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the benefits from our NOL carryforward amounts. Presently, impairment tests have not been conducted to verify NOL preservation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available.", "PERMNO": 91471, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACER"}
