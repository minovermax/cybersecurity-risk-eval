{"cik": "1141807", "company": "1ST CONSTITUTION BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are some important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forward-looking statement. These are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC.\nAn economic downturn or the return of negative developments in the financial services industry could negatively impact our operations.\nThe U.S. economic downturn from 2008 to 2010 resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general. Although the U.S. economy has experienced a recovery in the years since then, the possibility of a fall-back into recession always exists. The Federal Reserve, in an attempt to help the overall economy, has kept interest rates historically low through its targeted federal funds rate even though it has increased the federal funds rate once in each of 2015 and 2016, three times in 2017 and four times in 2018. If the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate in the future, overall interest rates may rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economy. An economic downturn or the return of negative developments in the financial services industry could negatively impact our operations by causing an increase in our provision for loan losses and a deterioration of our loan portfolio. Such a downturn may also adversely affect our ability to originate or sell loans. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nA downturn affecting the economy and/or the real estate market in our primary market area would adversely affect our loan portfolio and our growth potential.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s lending is in northern and central New Jersey and the New York City metropolitan area. As a result of this geographic concentration, a significant broad-based deterioration in economic conditions in the New Jersey and New York City metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, results of operations and future growth potential. A prolonged decline in economic conditions in our market area could restrict borrowers\u2019 ability to pay outstanding principal and interest on loans when due, and consequently, adversely affect the cash flows and results of operations of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio is primarily secured by real estate collateral located in the State of New Jersey. Conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the Company\u2019s loans are located strongly influence the level of the Company\u2019s non-performing loans and results of operations. A decline in the New Jersey real estate markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. Decreases in local real estate values would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for the Company\u2019s loans. Adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nThe Company faces significant competition.\nThe Company faces significant competition from many other banks, savings institutions and other financial institutions that have branch offices or otherwise operate in the Company\u2019s market area. Non-bank financial institutions, such as securities brokerage firms, insurance companies and money market funds, engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business, which has also led to greater competition. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the Company, including larger capital bases that allow them to attract customers seeking larger loans than the Company is able to accommodate and the ability to aggressively advertise their products and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable. There can be no assurance that the Company and the Bank will be able to successfully compete with these entities in the future.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the spread between the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates received on loans and other investments narrows, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk).\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nDuring the last ten years, it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. As a result, yields have been at levels lower than were available prior to 2008 on securities we have purchased and loans we have originated. Consequently, the average yield on our interest-earning assets has decreased during the low interest rate environment. As a general matter, our interest-bearing assets re-price or mature more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities. Our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets could decrease. While the Federal Reserve Board raised the targeted federal funds rate and discount rate in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and may further raise the targeted federal funds rate and discount rate in the future, we believe that interest rates may remain relatively low and could decline in the near future from current levels. Accordingly, our net interest margin could decline, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with speculative construction lending.\nThe risks associated with speculative construction lending include the borrower\u2019s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget, the sale of the project within projected absorption periods, the economic risks associated with real estate collateral, and the potential of a rising interest rate environment. Such loans may include financing the development and/or construction of residential subdivisions. This activity may involve financing land purchases, infrastructure development (i.e., roads, utilities, etc.), as well as construction of residences or multi-family dwellings for subsequent sale or lease by the developer/builder. Because the sale and leasing of developed properties is integral to the success of developer business, loan repayments may be especially subject to the volatility of real estate market values. Management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to minimize the inherent risks of speculative commercial real estate construction lending. Further, management concentrates lending efforts with developers demonstrating successful performance on marketable projects within the Bank\u2019s lending areas.\nOur mortgage warehouse lending business represents a significant portion of our overall lending activity and is subject to numerous risks.\nOur primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial business and commercial real estate loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio, the inherent primary risks are deteriorating credit quality, a decline in the economy, and a decline in New Jersey real estate market values. Any one, or a combination, of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies, loan losses and increased future provision levels.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of the mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Risks associated with these loans include, without limitation, (i) credit risks relating to the mortgage bankers that borrow from us, (ii) the risk of intentional misrepresentation or fraud by any of such mortgage bankers, (iii) changes in the market value of mortgage loans originated by the mortgage banker, the sale of which is the expected source of repayment of the borrowings under a warehouse line of credit, due to changes in interest rates during the time in warehouse, or (iv) unsalable or impaired mortgage loans so originated, which could lead to decreased collateral value and the failure of a purchaser of the mortgage loan to purchase the loan from the mortgage banker.\nThe impact of interest rates on our mortgage warehouse business can be significant. Changes in interest rates can impact the number of residential mortgages originated and initially funded under mortgage warehouse lines of credit and thus our mortgage warehouse related revenues. A decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans. Conversely, in a constant or increasing rate environment, we would expect fewer loans may be originated. Although we use models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgage related revenues, the estimates of net income produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand, prepayment speeds and other factors which may overstate or understate actual subsequent experience. Further, the concentration of our loan portfolio on loans originated through our mortgage warehouse business increases the risk associated with our loan portfolio because of the concentration of loans in a single line of business, namely one-to-four family residential mortgage lending, and in a particular segment of that business, namely mortgage warehouse lending.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loan and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs or reclassify loans. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs or loan reclassifications as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not successfully integrate banks that we may acquire in the future, the combined bank may be adversely affected.\nIf we make any acquisitions in the future, we will need to integrate the acquired entities into our existing business and systems. We may experience difficulties in accomplishing this integration or in effectively managing the combined bank after any future acquisition. The integration of any acquired entity will also divert the attention of our management. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating any future acquisitions into our own business.\nThe expected benefits from acquiring another entity may not be realized if the combined bank does not achieve certain cost savings and other benefits.\nOur belief that cost savings and revenue enhancements are achievable in any future acquisition is a forward-looking statement that is inherently uncertain. The combined bank\u2019s actual cost savings and revenue enhancements, if any, for any future acquisition cannot be quantified at this time. Any actual cost savings or revenue enhancements will depend on future expense levels and operating results, the timing of certain events and general industry, regulatory and business conditions. Many of these events will be beyond the control of the combined bank.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that the implementation of our strategy will depend in large part on the skills of our executive management team and our ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel. Accordingly, the loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and materially and adversely affect us. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and if significant resignations occur, we may not be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our executive management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although our Chief Executive Officer and President has entered into an employment agreement with us, it is possible that he may not complete the term of his employment agreement or may choose not to renew it upon expiration.\nOur customers also rely on us to deliver personalized financial services. Our success depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of the service of these individuals could undermine the confidence of our customers in our ability to provide such personalized services. We need to continue to attract and retain these individuals and to recruit other qualified individuals to ensure continued growth. In addition, competitors may recruit these individuals in light of the value of the individuals\u2019 relationships with their customers and communities and we may not be able to retain such relationships absent the individuals. If we are unable to attract and retain our branch managers and lending officers, and recruit individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, our business strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur directors and executive officers own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 14.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These shareholders, if acting together, may have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons, acting together, may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control;\n\u2022\nentrenching our management and/or the board of directors;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nFederal and state government regulation impacts the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe operations of the Company and the Bank are heavily regulated and will be affected by present and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities. In particular, the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement its objectives are changes in the discount rate charged on bank borrowings and the targeted Federal Funds rate. It is not possible to predict what changes, if any, will be made to the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such changes may have on the future business and earnings prospects of the Company.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Compliance with the rules and regulations of these agencies may be costly and may limit growth and restrict certain activities, including payment of dividends, investments, loans and interest rate charges, interest rates paid on deposits, and locations of offices. The Bank is also subject to capitalization guidelines set forth in federal legislation and regulations.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the impact of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, the cost of compliance could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory reforms may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or stock price.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act restructures the regulation of depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in 2008-2009. Also included was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new federal agency administering consumer and fair lending laws, a function that was previously performed by the depository institution regulators. The federal preemption of state laws currently accorded federally chartered depository institutions has been reduced as well. We expect that many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time, and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions\u2019 operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, international banking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significant changes in the regulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companies to support their businesses. The international rules, known as Basel III, generally increased the capital required to be held and narrow the types of instruments which will qualify as providing appropriate capital and imposed a new liquidity measurement. The Basel III requirements are complex and will be phased in over many years.\nThe Basel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or holding companies automatically. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. regulators to reform the system under which the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions, individually and systemically, are regulated. That reform effort included the regulation of capital and liquidity.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule (the \u201cFinal Rule\u201d) to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all U.S. banking organizations. On July 9, 2013, the FDIC approved an interim final rule (which became final in April 2014 with no substantive changes) that was substantially similar to the Final Rule. Effective January 1, 2015, these new requirements established the following minimum capital ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio of 4.0%. In addition, there is a requirement to maintain a capital conservation buffer, comprised of\nCET1 capital, in an amount greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over the minimum capital required by each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on the organization\u2019s ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement began phasing in on January 1, 2016, and initially required a buffer amount greater than 0.625% during 2016 in order to avoid these limitations. Following 2016, the required amount of the capital conservation buffer continues to increase each year until January 1, 2019 when the buffer amount must be greater than 2.5% in order to avoid the above limitations.\nThese regulations define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements, as well as the risk weight of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios.\nUnder these regulations, in order to be considered well-capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes, the Bank will be required to maintain the following ratios: (1) a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0% of risk weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of a least 10.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%. The Bank\u2019s CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios were 12.40%, 12.40%, 13.18%, and 11.74%, respectively, at December 31, 2018.\nThe application of these capital requirements could increase the Company\u2019s required capital levels and the cost of capital, among other things. Any permanent significant increase in the Company\u2019s cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products, the types of products we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our overall growth opportunities, among other things. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations or items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could also result in management modifying the Company\u2019s business strategy and limiting the Company\u2019s ability to repurchase our common stock. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in us having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Although most financial institutions would be affected, these business impacts could be felt unevenly, depending upon the business and product mix of each institution. Other potential adverse effects could include higher dilution of common shareholders if we had to issue additional shares and a higher risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in an adverse economic cycle.\nAny additional changes in the regulation and oversight of the Company, in the form of new laws, rules and regulations, could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operations.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate.\nThe price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market constantly changes and recently, given the uncertainty in the financial markets, has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2017 through the end of fiscal year 2018, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $27.00 per share and a low of $15.75 per share. We expect that the market closing price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock.\nOur common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nevents negatively impacting the financial services industry which result in a general decline in the market valuation of our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of material developments affecting our operations or our dividend policy;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, recently, the stock market generally has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results.\nThe Bank is subject to liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances.\nLiquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nLiquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. If we become unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risk.\nOur recurring cash requirements, at the holding company level, primarily consist of interest expense on junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts. Holding company cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the Bank.\nWhile we expect that the holding company will continue to receive dividends from the Bank sufficient to satisfy holding company cash needs, in the event that the Bank has insufficient resources or is subject to legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, the Bank may be unable to provide dividends or a sufficient level of dividends to the holding company; in that event, the holding company may have insufficient funds to satisfy its obligations as they become due.\nFuture growth, operating results or regulatory requirements may require us to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. To the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These actions could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC modified its assessment rules so that an institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity. These assessment base rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I banks and up to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV banks. Risk Category II and III banks have assessment base rates ranging from 9 to 33 basis points, respectively. If the risk category of the Bank changes adversely, our FDIC insurance premiums could increase.\nInsured depository institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, could significantly increase the loss provisions of the FDIC, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to historical lows. Effective January 1, 2011, the FDIC increased the designated reserve ratio from 1.25% to 2.00%. In addition, the Dodd-\nFrank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 per insured depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008, which may result in even larger losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThe FDIC may further increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the Deposit Insurance Fund to prescribed statutory target levels. An increase in the risk category for the Bank or in the assessment rates could have an adverse effect on the Bank's earnings. The FDIC may terminate deposit insurance for an institution if it determines that such institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated applicable laws, regulations or orders.\nFuture offerings of debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nIn the future, the Company may attempt to increase its capital resources or, if the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, the Company or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nThe Company may issue additional shares of common stock which may dilute the ownership and voting power of our shareholders and the book value of our common stock.\nThe Company is currently authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 8,611,342 shares were outstanding on February 28, 2019. We may decide to issue additional shares of common stock for any corporate purposes. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock in public offerings or up to 20% of our outstanding common stock in non-public offerings. Any issuance of shares of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our common shareholders and may reduce the market price of our common stock or dilute the book value of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nThe Company may lose lower-cost funding sources.\nChecking, savings, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing the Company\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nThere may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets or liabilities and financial results. The Company identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, security impairment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of the Company\u2019s external financial statements. FASB recently adopted new accounting standards related to fair value accounting, measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and accounting for leases that could materially change the Company\u2019s financial statements in the future. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and the Company\u2019s independent auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial results and condition. In certain cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently (also retroactively), which may result in the Company restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nIn addition, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") updated the criteria in its Internal-Control Integrated Framework for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company adopted such updated criteria, which changed the manner in which the Company assesses its internal controls over financial\nreporting, effective December 31, 2016. In the future, there may be further changes to the criteria used to assess the effectiveness of internal controls, which may result in the Company expending more resources to assess its internal controls.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition disclosures.\nWe must have effective internal controls over financial reporting in order to provide reliable financial reports, to effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we were unable to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies requiring remediation. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe continually work to improve our internal controls; however, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure appropriate and adequate controls over our future financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market value of our common stock.\nWe may be required to increase our allowance for credit losses as a result of a recent change to an accounting standard.\nIn 2016, the FASB released a new standard for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses. The new standard will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020. The new credit loss model will be a significant change from the standard in place today, as it requires the allowance for credit losses to be calculated based on current expected credit losses (commonly referred to as the \u201cCECL model\u201d) rather than losses inherent in the portfolio as of a point in time. Because the new CECL model focuses on the life of the loan concept, more data will be required to support allowance estimates, including that loan portfolios will need to be broken down by origination year. As a result, audit and disclosure requirements will increase. The extent of the increase is under evaluation, but will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio at the adoption date, and the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date. As a result, the potential financial impact is currently unknown.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions out of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 77% of our investment securities portfolio was comprised of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises obligations, U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises' mortgage backed securities and municipal securities. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately $212.4 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, ratings agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and instability in the credit markets. Any of these mentioned factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments in future periods and result in a realized loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgements about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company encounters continuous technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and may reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or to successfully market these products and services to its customers. Failure to keep pace with technological change\naffecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to operational risk.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication or electrical services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to provide services. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial operations or reputation.\nThe Company regularly collects, processes, transmits and stores significant amounts of confidential information regarding its customers, employees and others. This information is necessary for the conduct of the Company\u2019s business activities, including the ongoing maintenance of deposit, loan and other account relationships for the Bank's customers, and receiving instructions and affecting transactions for those customers and other users of the Bank\u2019s products and services. In addition to confidential information regarding its customers, employees and others, the Company compiles, processes, transmits and stores proprietary, non-public information concerning its own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on behalf of the Company.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. Although cybersecurity incidents in the financial services industry are on the rise, we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. A failure in or breach of the Company\u2019s operational or information security systems, or those of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect its business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage its reputation, increase its costs and/or cause losses. The Company may also be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications or disclosure. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect the Company\u2019s systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a very high priority for the Company.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, the Company could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss. Mishandling, misuse or loss of this confidential or proprietary information could occur, for example, if the confidential or proprietary information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of the systems or employees of the Company, or the systems or employees of third parties which have collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored the information on the Company\u2019s behalf, where the information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties or where there is a failure or breach of the network, communications or information systems which are used to collect, compile, process, transmit or store the information.\nThe Company continues to implement protections and adopt procedures to address the risks posed by the current information technology environment. For example, the Company has and continues to introduce systems and software to prevent cyber incidents and continues to review and strengthen its defenses to cybersecurity threats through the use of various services, programs and outside vendors. The Company also continually reviews and revises its cybersecurity policy to ensure that it remains up to date. In the event that the Company experiences a material cybersecurity incident or identifies a material cybersecurity threat, the Company will make all reasonable efforts to properly disclose it in a timely fashion. However, it is impossible for the Company to know when or if such incidents may arise or the business impact of any such incident.\nAs a result of such risks, the Company has significantly increased the resources dedicated to this effort and believes that further increases may be required in the future, in anticipation of increases in the sophistication and persistency of such attacks. The Company has and is likely to continue to incur additional costs in preparing its infrastructure and maintaining it to resist any such attacks. In addition to personnel dedicated to overseeing the infrastructure and systems to defend against cybersecurity incidents, senior management is regularly briefed on issues, preparedness and any incidents requiring response. At its regularly scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors are periodically briefed and brought up to date on cybersecurity matters.\nNotwithstanding the precaution we need to take to safeguard this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these precautions do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, or that if mishandling, misuse or loss of the information did occur, those events would be promptly detected and addressed. Nor is there any guarantee that the Company's cybersecurity efforts will be successful in discovering or preventing a security breach, and any failure or failures to safeguard against such security breaches may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial results, or reputation\nPossible replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA and submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. Some of our assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the possible replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, but are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve Board proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Reform of, or the replacement or phasing out of, LIBOR and proposed regulation of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may materially adversely affect the amount of interest paid on any LIBOR-based loans, investment securities and borrowings of the Company and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis, which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism and other laws and regulations in the United States. These laws and regulations require us, among other things, to adopt and enforce \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed, require improved systems, sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision.\nWhile we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities, those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities. To the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, the FDIC and/or with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties on us. In addition, our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes. At its regularly scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors are periodically briefed and brought up to date on money laundering and related matters.\nThere may be claims and litigation.\nFrom time to time as part of the Company\u2019s normal course of business, customers make claims and take legal actions against the Company based on actions or inactions of the Company. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services. This may also impact customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nA significant portion of our primary markets are located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather, or in response to climate change, that could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Additionally, surrounding areas, including New Jersey, may be central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the United States. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89270, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCCY"}
