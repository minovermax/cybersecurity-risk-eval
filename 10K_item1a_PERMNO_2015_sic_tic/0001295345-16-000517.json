RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Back to Table of Contents\nThe Company, since emergence from bankruptcy, has very limited operations and resources.\nSince the Company emerged from bankruptcy, its operations have been limited to seeking potential business combinations. Our investors will have no basis upon which to evaluate the Company's ability to achieve the Company's business objective, which is to effect a merger or business combination with an operating business. The Company will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination.\nUnspecified and unascertainable risks.\nThere is no basis for shareholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of potential business combination or the particular industry in which the Company may ultimately operate. To the extent that the Company effects a business combination with a financially unstable operating company or an entity that is in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of revenues or income, the Company will become subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of that financially unstable company. In addition, to the extent that the Company effects a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high degree of risk, the Company will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes certain industries that experience rapid growth. Although Management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular business or industry, there can be no assurance that Management will properly ascertain or assess all such risks or that subsequent events may not alter the risks that the Company perceived at the time of the consummation of a business combination.\nThe Company may issue shares of the Company's common stock and preferred stock to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of the Company's stockholders and likely cause a change in control of the Company's ownership.\nThe Company's certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 900,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The Company currently has 894,011,260 authorized but unissued shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance and all of the 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. Although the Company currently has no commitments to issue any securities, the Company will, in all likelihood, issue a substantial number of additional shares of its common stock or preferred stock, or a combination of common and preferred stock, in connection with a business combination. To the extent that additional shares of common and/or preferred stock are issued, the Company's shareholders would experience dilution of their respective ownership interests in the Company. The issuance of additional shares of common stock and/or convertible preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock, in the event that an active trading market commences, of which there can be no assurance. The issuance of additional shares of the Company's common stock or any number of shares of the Company's preferred stock:\n- may significantly reduce the equity interest of current stockholders;\n- will likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of the Company's shares of common stock are issued and most likely also result in the resignation of the Company's present officer and director; and\n- may adversely affect prevailing market price for the Company's common stock.\nSimilarly, if the Company issues debt securities, it could result in:\n- default and foreclosure on the Company's assets if the Company's operating revenues after a business combination were insufficient to pay the Company's debt obligations;\n- acceleration of the Company's obligations to repay the indebtedness even if the Company has made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and any such covenant is breached without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n- the Company's immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\n- the Company's inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting the Company's ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding.\nIt is likely that the Company's current officers and directors will resign upon consummation of a business combination and the Company will have only limited ability to evaluate the management of the target business.\nThe Company's ability to successfully effect a business combination will be dependent upon the efforts of the Company's Management. The future role of the Company's key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although it is possible that Management will remain associated in some capacity with the target business following a business combination, it is likely that the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Although the Company intends to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business in connection with evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, the Company cannot assure you that the Company's assessment of management will prove to be correct.\nDependence on key personnel\nThe Company is dependent upon the continued services of its officers and directors. To the extent that their services become unavailable, the Company will be required to obtain other qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that it will be able to recruit and hire qualified persons at acceptable terms.\nThe Company's officers and directors may allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to the Company's affairs. This could have a negative impact on the Company's ability to consummate a business combination.\nThe Company's officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to the Company's affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between the Company's plan of operations and other businesses. The Company does not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. Management of the Company is engaged in several other business endeavors and is not obligated to contribute any specific number of their hours per week to the Company's affairs. If Management's other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to the Company's affairs and could have a negative impact on the Company's ability to consummate a business combination.\nThe Company's officers and directors are now, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by the Company and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented to.\nThe Company's officers and directors are now, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities, including other companies engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by this Company. Additionally, the Company's officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to this Company as well as the other entities with which he is or may be affiliated. Additionally, due to the existing affiliations of the Company's officers and directors with other entities, they may have a fiduciary obligation to present potential business opportunities to those entities in addition to presenting them to us which could cause additional conflicts of interest. Accordingly, Management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nIt is probable that the Company will only be able to enter into one business combination, which will cause us to be solely dependent on such single business and a limited number of products, processes or services.\nIt is probable that the Company will enter into a business combination with a single operating business. Accordingly, the prospects for the Company's success may be:\n- solely dependent upon the performance of a single operating business; or\n- dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nIn this case, the Company will not be able to diversify the Company's operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry.\nThe Company has limited resources and there is significant competition for business combination opportunities. Therefore, the Company may not be able to enter into or consummate an attractive business combination.\nThe Company expects to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to the Company's, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess far greater technical, human and other resources than does the Company and the Company's financial resources are very limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While the Company believes that there are numerous potential target businesses that it could acquire, the Company's ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by the Company's limited financial resources and the fact that the Company will use its common stock to acquire an operating business. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of far more target businesses than the Company.\nThe Company may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel the Company to restructure a potential business transaction or abandon a particular business combination.\nThe Company has not yet identified any prospective target business. If we require funds because of the size of the business combination, we will be required to seek additional financing. We cannot assure you that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of the Company's officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.\nAdditional financing requirements associated with compliance with reporting requirements under the Exchange Act.\nThe Company has no revenues and is dependent upon the willingness of the Company's Management to fund the costs associated with the reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, other administrative costs associated with the Company's corporate existence and expenses related to the Company's business objective. The Company may not generate any revenues until the consummation of a business combination. The Company anticipates that it will have available sufficient financial resources to continue to pay accounting and other professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses that may be required until the Company commences business operations in connection with a business combination. In the event that the Company's available financial resources from its Management prove to be insufficient for the purpose of achieving its business objective through a business combination, the Company will be required to seek additional financing. The Company's failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse affect on the Company's ability to pursue a business combination. The Company does not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing and there can be no assurance that any such arrangement would be available on terms acceptable and in the Company's best interests. The Company does not have any written agreement with Management to provide funds for the Company's operating expenses.\nReporting requirements may delay or preclude a business combination\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to provide certain information about significant acquisitions and other material events. The Company will continue to be required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, which annual report must contain the Company's audited financial statements. As a reporting company under the Exchange Act, following any business combination, we will be required to file a report on Form 8-K, which report contains audited financial statements of the acquired entity. These audited financial statements must be filed with the SEC within 5 days following the transaction. While obtaining audited financial statements is typically the responsibility of the acquired company, it is possible that a potential target company may be a non-reporting company with unaudited financial statements. The time and costs that may be incurred by some potential target companies to prepare such audited financial statements may significantly delay or may even preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable business combination. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition because we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.\nThe Company's shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Markets, which limits the liquidity and price of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company's shares of common stock are traded on the OTC Markets. Quotation of the Company's securities on the OTC Markets limits the liquidity and price of the Company's common stock more than if the Company's shares of common stock were listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market or a national exchange. There is currently no active trading market in the Company's common stock. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Company's common stock following a business combination. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of the Company's shares of common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.\nThe Company may be deemed to have no \"Independent Directors\", actions taken and expenses incurred by our officer and director on behalf of the Company will generally not be subject to \"Independent Review\".\nThe Company's officers and directors may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on the Company's behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket expenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of directors. If our directors will not be deemed \"independent,\" they will generally not have the benefits of independent directors examining the propriety of expenses incurred on our behalf and the sums subject to reimbursement. Although the Company believes that all actions taken by our directors on the Company's behalf will be in the Company's best interests, the Company cannot assure our shareholders or investors that this will actually be the case. If actions are taken, or expenses are incurred that are actually not in the Company's best interests, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and plan of operations and adversely affect the price of our stock held by the public stockholders.\nState blue sky registration; potential limitations on resale of the Company's common stock\nThe holders of the Company's shares of common stock registered under the Exchange Act and those persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that may develop in the future, should be aware that there may be state blue-sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell the Company's securities. Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for the Registrant's securities to be a limited one.\nIt is the intention of the Registrant's Management following the consummation of a business combination to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the Registrant in an accepted publication manual which permits a manual exemption. The manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the Registrant issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. Furthermore, the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities.\nMost of the accepted manuals are those published by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they \"recognize securities manuals\" but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.\nDividends unlikely\nThe Company does not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future because it has no revenues and no cash. The payment of dividends will be contingent upon the Company's future revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and overall financial conditions. The payment of any future dividends will be within the discretion of the Company's board of directors as then constituted. It is the Company's expectation that future management following a business combination will determine to retain any earnings for use in its business operations and accordingly, the Company does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur common stock is subject to the Penny Stock Rules of the SEC and the trading market in our common stock is limited, which makes transactions in our common stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock\nThe Company's common stock is considered a Penny Stock, as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, unless and until the price of the Company's shares of common stock is at least $5.00. The Company's share price presently is, and prior to any business combination, the share price is expected to be less than $5.00. Unless the Company's common stock is otherwise excluded from the definition of Penny Stock, the Penny Stock rules apply. The Penny Stock rules require a Broker-Dealer prior to a transaction in a Penny Stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about the Penny Stock and the nature and level of risks in the Penny Stock market. The Broker-Dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the Penny Stock, the compensation of the Broker-Dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each Penny Stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the Penny Stock rules require that the Broker-Dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the Penny Stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that is subject to the Penny Stock rules. So long as the common stock is subject to the Penny Stock rules, it may become more difficult to sell such securities. Such requirements could result in reduction in the level of trading activity for the Company's common stock and could make it more difficult for investors to sell the Company's common stock.\nGeneral Economic Risks\nThe Company's current and future business plans are dependent, in large part, on the state of the general economy. Adverse changes in economic conditions may adversely affect the Company's plan of operation and business objective. These conditions and other factors beyond the Company's control include, but are not limited to regulatory changes.", "PERMNO": 76295, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "USAQ"}
