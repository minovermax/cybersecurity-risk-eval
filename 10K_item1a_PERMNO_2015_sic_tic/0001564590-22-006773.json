Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. An investment in our stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those that are described from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those risks and uncertainties discussed at-length below, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\u2022\nThe risks inherent in owning or leasing real estate.\n\u2022\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive.\n\u2022\nOur future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.\n\u2022\nSignificant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.\n\u2022\nIt may be difficult for our investors to determine the creditworthiness of our tenants.\n\u2022\nAn increase in costs and liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nWe are defending pending lawsuits and claims that may subject us to material losses.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.\n\u2022\nThe concentration of a significant number of our properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.\n\u2022\nProperty taxes on our properties may increase without notice.\n\u2022\nOur business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.\n\u2022\nAdverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur exposure to counterparty risk.\n\u2022\nInflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur assets may be subject to impairment charges.\n\u2022\nOur accounting policies and methods require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\u2022\nAmendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) or changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.\n\u2022\nOur reliance on certain members of our management team or Board of Directors, the loss of any one of which could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nOur reliance on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\n\u2022\nOur dependency on external sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022\nInterest rate risk and our ability to manage or mitigate this risk effectively.\n\u2022\nAdverse effects by the transition from LIBOR.\nRisks Related to Our Investment Strategy\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.\n\u2022\nWe expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.\n\u2022\nWe are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.\nRisks Related to Our Status as a REIT\n\u2022\nThe failure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\u2022\nThe uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our ATM program could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.\n\u2022\nA risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.\n\u2022\nU.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations.\n\u2022\nIn order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\n\u2022\nChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.\n\u2022\nChanges in our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.\n\u2022\nOur forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.\n\u2022\nIn case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement that is in effect under our ATM Program will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds.\n\u2022\nFuture issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.\n\u2022\nMaryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe are subject to risks inherent in owning and leasing real estate.\nWe are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to leasing and owning real estate, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general risks applicable to us, our risks include, among others: our liability as a lessee for long-term lease obligations regardless of our revenues; deterioration in national, regional and local economic and real estate market conditions; potential changes in supply of, or demand for, rental properties similar to ours; competition for tenants and declining rental rates; difficulty in selling or re-leasing properties on favorable terms or at all; impairments in our ability to collect rent or other payments due to us when they are due; increases in interest rates and adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing; uninsured property liability; the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws; adverse changes in zoning laws and other regulations; acts of terrorism and war; acts of God; the unforeseen impacts of climate change, compliance with any future laws or regulations designed to prevent or mitigate the impacts of climate change, and any material costs related thereto; the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time the need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; and physical or weather-related damage to our properties. Certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, including: (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, (iii) environmental remediation costs and (iv) operating and maintenance costs. The combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nEach of the factors listed above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid, which means that our ability to vary our portfolio of properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited.\nWe are in a competitive business.\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive. Where we own properties, we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties. Our principal means of competition are rents we are able to charge in relation to the income producing potential of the location. In addition, we expect other major real estate investors, some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have, will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities. These competitors include petroleum manufacturing, distributing and marketing companies, convenience store retailers, other REITs, public and private investment funds, and other individual and institutional investors. This competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future.\nOur future cash flow is dependent on the performance of our tenants of their lease obligations, renewal of existing leases and either re-leasing or selling our properties.\nWe are subject to risks that financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may lead to vacancy at our properties or disruption in rent receipts as a result of partial payment or nonpayment of rent or that expiring leases may not be renewed. Under unfavorable general economic conditions, there can be no assurance that our tenants\u2019 level of sales and financial performance generally will not be adversely affected, which in turn could negatively impact our rental revenues. We are subject to risks that the terms governing renewal or re-leasing of our properties (including, compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, such as the remediation of contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets, the cost of required renovations, or replacement of USTs and related equipment) may be less favorable than current lease terms.\nWe are also subject to the risk that we may receive less net proceeds from the properties we sell as compared to their current carrying value or that the value of our properties may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic conditions. Unfavorable general economic conditions may also negatively impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties. Numerous properties compete\nwith our properties in attracting tenants to lease space. The number of available or competitive properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease or sell our properties and on the rents we are able to charge. In addition to the risk of disruption in rent receipts, we are subject to the risk of incurring real estate taxes, maintenance, environmental and other expenses at vacant properties. The financial distress, default or bankruptcy of our tenants may also lead to protracted and expensive processes for retaking control of our properties than would otherwise be the case, including, eviction or other legal proceedings related to or resulting from the tenant\u2019s default. These risks are greater with respect to certain of our tenants who lease multiple properties from us. If a tenant files for bankruptcy protection it is possible that we would recover substantially less than the full value of our claims against the tenant. If (i) our tenants do not perform their lease obligations, (ii) we are unable to renew existing leases and promptly recapture and re-lease or sell our properties, (iii) lease terms upon renewal or re-leasing are less favorable than current or historical lease terms, (iv) the values of properties that we sell are adversely affected by market conditions, or (v) we incur significant costs or disruption related to or resulting from tenant financial distress, default or bankruptcy, then our cash flow could be significantly adversely affected.\nSignificant number of our tenants depend on the same industry for their revenues.\nWe derive significant portion of our revenues from leasing, primarily on a triple-net basis, and financing convenience store and gasoline station properties to tenants in the petroleum marketing industry. Accordingly, significant portion of our revenues depend on the economic success of the petroleum marketing industry, and any factors that adversely affect that industry, such as disruption in the supply of petroleum or a decrease in the demand for conventional motor fuels due to conservation, technological advancements in petroleum-fueled motor vehicles or an increase in the use of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuel, electric and battery-operated vehicles, or other \u201cgreen technologies,\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Similarly, governmental regulations regarding climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions may accelerate these trends that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. The success of participants in the petroleum marketing industry depends upon the sale of refined petroleum products at margins in excess of fixed and variable expenses. The petroleum marketing industry is highly competitive and volatile. Petroleum products are commodities, the prices of which depend on numerous factors that affect supply and demand. The prices paid by our tenants and other petroleum marketers for products are affected by global, national and regional factors. A large, rapid increase in wholesale petroleum prices would adversely affect the profitability and cash flows of our tenants if the increased cost of petroleum products could not be passed on to their customers or if automobile consumption of gasoline was to decline significantly. We cannot be certain as to how these factors will affect petroleum product prices or supply in the future, or how in particular they will affect our tenants.\nBecause certain of our tenants are not rated and their financial information is not available to you, it may be difficult for our investors to determine their creditworthiness.\nThe majority of our properties are leased to tenants who are not rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition, our tenants\u2019 financial information is not generally available to our investors. Additionally, many of our tenants are part of larger corporate organizations and we do not receive financial information for the other entities in those organizations. The financial distress of other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. Because of the lack of financial information or credit ratings it is, therefore, difficult for our investors to assess the creditworthiness of our tenants and to determine the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. It is possible that the assumptions and estimates we make after reviewing publicly and privately obtained information about our tenants are not accurate and that we may be required to increase reserves for bad debts, record allowances for deferred rent receivable or record additional expenses if our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to us.\nWe incur significant operating costs and, from time to time, may have significant liability accruals as a result of environmental laws and regulations, which costs and accruals could significantly increase, and reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters relating to the protection of the environment. Under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, or under, such property, and may be required to investigate and clean-up such contamination. Such laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility first on the party responsible for the contamination, but can also impose liability and clean-up responsibility on the owner and the current operator without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, or the timing or cause of the contamination. Liability under such environmental laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility and the financial resources are available to perform the remediation. For example, liability may arise as a result of the historical use of a property or from the migration of contamination from adjacent or nearby properties. Any such contamination or liability may also reduce the value of the property. In addition, the owner or operator of\na property may be subject to claims by third-parties based on injury, damage and/or costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from a property. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future, or how existing laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not previously been applied. Additionally, compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, which may develop in the future, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, or that of our tenants, and could require substantial additional expenditures for future remediation. Accordingly, compliance with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nThe majority of the properties owned or controlled by us are leased as convenience store and gasoline station properties, and therefore may contain, or may have contained, USTs for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances, which creates a potential for the release of such products or substances. Some of our properties are subject to regulations regarding the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long-lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials, USTs and other equipment. Some of the properties may be adjacent to or near properties that have contained or currently contain USTs used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of the properties are on, adjacent to, or near properties upon which others have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. There may be other environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. These problems may make it more difficult for us to re-lease or sell our properties on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe enter into leases and various other agreements which contractually allocate responsibility between the parties for known and unknown environmental liabilities at or relating to the subject properties. We are contingently liable for these environmental obligations in the event that our tenant does not satisfy them, and we are required to accrue for environmental liabilities that we believe are allocable to others under our leases if we determine that it is probable that our tenant will not meet its environmental obligations. It is possible that our assumptions regarding the ultimate allocation method and share of responsibility that we used to allocate environmental liabilities may change, which may result in material adjustments to the amounts recorded for environmental litigation accruals and environmental remediation liabilities. We assess whether to accrue for environmental liabilities based upon relevant factors including our tenants\u2019 histories of paying for such obligations, our assessment of their financial capability, and their intent to pay for such obligations. However, there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so. We may ultimately be responsible to pay for environmental liabilities as the property owner if our tenant fails to pay them. The ultimate resolution of these matters could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nFor substantially all of our triple-net leases, our tenants are contractually responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, removal of USTs at the end of their lease term (the cost of which in certain cases is partially borne by us) and remediation of any environmental contamination that arises during the term of their tenancy. Under the terms of our leases covering properties previously leased to Marketing (substantially all of which commenced in 2012), we have agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination at the premises that was known at the time the lease commenced, and for environmental contamination which existed prior to commencement of the lease and is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first 10 years of the lease term (or a shorter period for a minority of such leases). After expiration of such 10-year (or, in certain cases, shorter) period, responsibility for all newly discovered contamination, even if it relates to periods prior to commencement of the lease, is contractually allocated to our tenant. Our tenants at properties previously leased to Marketing are in all cases responsible for the cost of any remediation of contamination that results from their use and occupancy of our properties. Under substantially all of our other triple-net leases, responsibility for remediation of all environmental contamination discovered during the term of the lease (including known and unknown contamination that existed prior to commencement of the lease) is the responsibility of our tenant.\nWe anticipate that USTs at a number of properties we currently own and which were previously leased to Marketing will be replaced in the years ahead as these USTs near the end of their useful lives. For long-term, triple-net leases covering sites previously leased to Marketing, our tenants are responsible for the cost of removal and replacement of USTs and for remediation of contamination found during such UST removal and replacement, unless such contamination was found during the first 10 years of the lease term and also existed prior to commencement of the lease. In those cases, we are responsible for costs associated with the remediation of such preexisting contamination. We have also agreed to be responsible for environmental contamination that existed prior to the sale of certain properties assuming the contamination is discovered (other than as a result of a voluntary site investigation) during the first five years after the sale of the properties.\nIn the course of certain UST removals and replacements at properties previously leased to Marketing where we retained continuing responsibility for preexisting environmental obligations, previously unknown environmental contamination was and continues to be discovered. As a result, we have developed an estimate of fair value for the prospective future environmental liability resulting from preexisting unknown environmental contamination and have accrued for these estimated costs. These estimates are based primarily upon quantifiable trends which we believe allow us to make reasonable estimates of fair value for the future costs of environmental remediation resulting from the removal and replacement of USTs. Our accrual of the additional liability represents our estimate of the fair value of cost for each component of the liability, net of estimated recoveries from state UST remediation funds considering estimated recovery rates developed from prior experience with the funds. In arriving at our accrual, we analyzed the ages of USTs at properties where we would be responsible for preexisting contamination found within 10 years after commencement of a\nlease (for properties subject to long-term triple-net leases) or five years from a sale (for divested properties), and projected a cost to closure for preexisting unknown environmental contamination.\nWe measure our environmental remediation liabilities at fair value based on expected future net cash flows, adjusted for inflation, and then discount them to present value. We adjust our environmental remediation liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in projected expenditures, changes in present value due to the passage of time and reductions in estimated liabilities as a result of actual expenditures incurred during each quarter. As of December 31, 2021, we had accrued a total of $47.6 million for our prospective environmental remediation obligations. This accrual consisted of (a) $11.4 million, which was our estimate of reasonably estimable environmental remediation liability, including obligations to remove USTs for which we are responsible, net of estimated recoveries and (b) $36.2 million for future environmental liabilities related to preexisting unknown contamination.\nFor additional information regarding pending environmental lawsuits and claims, and environmental remediation obligations and estimates, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d, \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Notes 3 and 5 in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, including the amount of data available upon initial assessment of contamination, alternative treatment methods that may be applied, location of the property which subjects it to differing local laws and regulations and their interpretations, changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment, the availability of state UST remediation funds and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to allocation of responsibilities to others, as well as the time it takes to remediate contamination and receive regulatory approval. In developing our liability for estimated environmental remediation obligations on a property by property basis, we consider, among other things, laws and regulations, assessments of contamination and surrounding geology, quality of information available, currently available technologies for treatment, alternative methods of remediation and prior experience. Environmental accruals are based on estimates derived upon facts known to us at this time, which are subject to significant change as circumstances change, and as environmental contingencies become more clearly defined and reasonably estimable.\nWe cannot predict if state UST fund programs will be administered and funded in the future in a manner that is consistent with past practices and if future environmental spending will continue to be eligible for reimbursement at historical recovery rates under these programs. As a result, our estimates in respect of recoveries from state UST remediation funds could change, which could adversely affect our accruals for environmental remediation liabilities.\nAny changes to our estimates or our assumptions that form the basis of our estimates may result in our providing an accrual, or adjustments to the amounts recorded, for environmental remediation liabilities. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nWe are defending pending lawsuits and claims and are subject to material losses.\nWe are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including litigation related to environmental matters, such as those arising from leaking USTs, contamination of groundwater with methyl tertiary butyl ether (a fuel derived from methanol, commonly referred to as \u201cMTBE\u201d) and releases of motor fuel into the environment, and toxic tort claims. The ultimate resolution of certain matters cannot be predicted because considerable uncertainty exists both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimate of such loss. Our ultimate liabilities resulting from the lawsuits and claims we face could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. For additional information with respect to certain pending lawsuits and claims, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 3 in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to losses that may not be covered by insurance.\nWe and our tenants carry insurance against certain risks and in such amounts as we believe are customary for businesses of our kind. However, as the costs and availability of insurance change, we may decide not to be covered against certain losses (such as certain environmental liabilities, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and civil disorder) where, in the judgment of management, the insurance is not warranted due to cost or availability of coverage or the remoteness of perceived risk. Furthermore, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. There is no assurance that the existing insurance coverages are or will be sufficient to cover actual losses incurred. The destruction of, or significant damage to, or significant liabilities arising out of conditions at, our properties due to an uninsured loss would result in an economic loss and could result in us losing both our investment in, and anticipated profits from, such properties. When a loss is insured, the coverage may be insufficient in amount or duration, or a lessee\u2019s customers may be lost, such that the lessee cannot resume its business after the loss at prior levels or at all, resulting in reduced rent or a default under its lease. Any such loss relating to a large number of properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nA significant portion of our properties are concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and adverse conditions in those regions, in particular, could negatively impact our operations.\nA significant portion of the properties we own and lease are located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, as of December 31, 2021, 38.7% of our properties are concentrated in three states (New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut). Because of the concentration of our properties in those regions, in the event of adverse economic conditions in those regions, we would likely experience higher risk of default on payment of rent to us than if our properties were more geographically diversified. Additionally, the rents on our properties may be subject to a greater risk of default than other properties in the event of adverse economic, political or business developments, natural disasters or severe weather that may affect the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the ability of our lessees to make rent payments. This lack of geographical diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nProperty taxes on our properties may increase without notice.\nEach of the properties we own or lease is subject to real property taxes. The leases for certain of the properties that we lease from third-parties obligate us to pay real property taxes with regard to those properties. The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire or lease in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. To the extent that our tenants are unable or unwilling to pay such increase in accordance with their leases, our net operating expenses may increase.\nOur business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service.\nThere is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms (which may also result in losses) or accept financing on unfavorable terms.\nAdverse developments in general business, economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAdverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, either in the economy generally or in those regions in which a large portion of our business is conducted, could have a material adverse effect on us and significantly increase certain of the risks we are subject to. Among other effects, adverse economic conditions could depress real estate values, impact our ability to re-lease or sell our properties and have an adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 level of sales and financial performance generally. As our revenues are substantially dependent on the economic success of our tenants, any factors that adversely impact our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war could negatively affect our business or the businesses of our tenants. These attacks may directly or indirectly impact the physical facilities, networks or the business or the financial condition of us or those of our tenants, vendors or financial institutions with which we have a relationship or conduct business. The consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in, or which could exacerbate, an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nWe are exposed to counterparty risk and there can be no assurances that we will effectively manage or mitigate this risk.\nWe regularly interact with counterparties in various industries. The types of counterparties most common to our transactions and agreements include, but are not limited to, landlords, tenants, vendors and lenders. We also enter into agreements to acquire and sell properties which allocate responsibility for certain costs to the counterparty. Our most significant counterparties include, but are not limited to, the members of the bank syndicate related to our Second Restated Credit Agreement, the lenders that are the counterparties to our senior unsecured notes and our major tenants from whom we derive a significant amount of rental revenue. The default, insolvency or other inability or unwillingness of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under an agreement, including, without limitation, as a result of the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy proceedings, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we leased 150 properties in three separate unitary leases and two stand-alone leases to subsidiaries of Global. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Global represented 16% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Global are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2021, we leased 128 properties in four separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Arko. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Arko represented 14% and 15% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. All of our unitary leases with subsidiaries of Arko are guaranteed by the parent company. As of December 31, 2021, we leased 78 properties in three separate unitary leases and one stand-alone lease to United Oil. In the aggregate, our leases with United Oil represented 11% and 12% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we leased 69 properties in two separate unitary leases to subsidiaries of Chestnut. In the aggregate, our leases with subsidiaries of Chestnut represented 9% and 10% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The largest of these unitary leases, covering 52 of our properties, is guaranteed by the parent company, its principals and numerous Chestnut affiliates.\nWe may also undertake additional transactions with these or other existing tenants, which would further concentrate our sources of rental revenues. Many of our tenants, including those noted above, are part of larger corporate organizations and the financial distress of one subsidiary or other affiliated companies or businesses in those organizations may negatively impact the ability or willingness of our tenant to perform its obligations under its lease with us. The failure of a major tenant or their default in their rental and other obligations to us is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nInflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though our triple-net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants\u2019 ability to pay rent.\nAlso, during inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term is limited to our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our Revolving Facility. Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the real estate acquisitions and construction costs necessary to complete our development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher acquisition and construction costs could adversely impact our net investments in real estate and expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects, which may make otherwise lucrative investment opportunities less profitable to us. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, could be adversely affected over time.\nOur assets may be subject to impairment charges.\nWe periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on GAAP, and includes a variety of factors such as market conditions, the accumulation of asset retirement costs due to changes in estimates associated with our estimated environmental liabilities, the status of significant leases, the financial condition of major tenants and other assumptions and factors that could affect the cash flow from or fair value of our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $4.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges. We may be required to take similar impairment charges, which could affect the implementation of our current business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations. We have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates, judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, receivables and related reserves, deferred rent receivable, income under direct financing leases, asset retirement obligations (including environmental remediation obligations and future environmental liabilities for pre-existing unknown environmental contamination), real estate, depreciation and amortization, carrying value of our properties, impairment of long-lived assets, litigation,\naccrued liabilities, income taxes and allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our accounting policies, methods, judgments, assumptions, estimates and allocations prove to be incorrect, or if circumstances change, our business, financial condition, revenues, operating expense, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price may be materially adversely affected.\nAmendments to the Accounting Standards Codification made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) or changes in accounting standards issued by other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, which is periodically amended by the FASB. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time-to-time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability or financial position.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAs a result of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies, we will make efforts to further improve our internal control over financial reporting controls. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful. Any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal control over financial reporting controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the per share trading price of our common stock.\nThe loss of certain members of our management team or Board of Directors could adversely affect our business or the market price of our common stock.\nOur future success and ability to implement our business and investment strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key management personnel and directors, and on the continued contributions of such persons, each of whom may be difficult to replace. As a REIT, we employ only 31 employees and have a cost-effective management structure. We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executives. In the event of the loss of key management personnel or directors, or upon unexpected death, disability or retirement, we may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price. Additionally, certain of our directors beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If any of these directors cease to be a director of the Company and they or their estate sell a significant portion of such holdings into the public market, it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. Additionally, our failure to comply with applicable privacy, data security or protection or cybersecurity laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential tenant information, such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, whether of our systems or those of our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure by us, or our vendors or other third parties who hold or have access to our information to\nmaintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.\nGovernments are continuing to focus on privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and data security and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding our employees\u2019 and users\u2019 data could require us to modify our business, services and products features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, and features. Although we have made efforts to design our policies, procedures, and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal, and foreign laws, changes to applicable laws and regulations in this area could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, any of which could significantly increase our operating costs.\nOur business and results of operations have been, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results is uncertain, and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity; the actions taken in response to economic disruption; the reduced economic activity, if not closures from time to time of our tenants\u2019 facilities, may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our portfolio of properties; the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our Revolving Facility and pay dividends; and a deterioration in our or our tenants\u2019 ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services to us or our tenants from vendors that are needed for our or our tenants\u2019 efficient operations could adversely affect our operations and those of our tenants.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nWe are dependent on external sources of capital which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe are dependent on external sources of capital to maintain our status as a REIT and must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. Therefore, we will have to continue to rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We may need to access the capital markets in order to execute future significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows from our operations, funds available under our $300.0 million senior unsecured credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cSecond Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), with a group of commercial banks led by Bank of America, N.A., proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through offerings, from time to time, under our at-the-market program (\u201cATM Program\u201d,) pursuant to which we may also sell shares of common stock under forward sale agreements and available cash and cash equivalents. Pursuant to the Second Restated Credit Agreement, we (i) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from March 2022 to October 2025, (ii) reduced the interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Facility and (iii) amended certain financial covenants and other provisions. The Second Restated Credit Agreement provides for the Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 and includes an accordion feature to increase the revolving commitments or add one or more tranches of term loans up to an additional aggregate amount not to exceed $300,000,000, subject to certain conditions, including one or more new or existing lenders agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount and that no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the terms of the Revolving Facility. We have also issued $525.0 million of senior unsecured notes. For additional information, see \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d and \u201cSenior Unsecured Notes\u201d in Note 4 in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nThe Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as leverage, coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur\nadditional debt or pay dividends. The Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes also contain customary events of default, including cross defaults to each other, change of control and failure to maintain REIT status (provided that the senior unsecured notes require a mandatory offer to prepay the notes upon a change in control in lieu of a change of control event of default). Our ability to meet the terms of the agreements is dependent upon our continued ability to meet certain criteria, as further described in Note 4 in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Form 10-K, the performance of our tenants and the other risks described in this section. If we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants, which could result in an event of default under our Second Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non-compliance. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nUnder our ATM Program, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $250.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program may be made from time to time in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, including by means of ordinary brokers\u2019 transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or as otherwise agreed to with the applicable agent. Sales of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common stock. Our agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of our common stock, but each agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulation to sell shares designated by us in accordance with the terms of the distribution agreement with our agents. The net proceeds we receive will be the gross proceeds received from such sales less the commissions and any other costs we may incur in issuing the shares of our common stock. In connection with the expansion of the ATM Program in 2021, we may also sell shares of common stock under forward sale agreements. The use of a forward sale agreement would allow us to lock in a price on the sale of shares of common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date.\nWe may use a portion of the net proceeds from any of such sales to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility includes lenders who are affiliates of our agents and may be affiliates of our forward sellers and/or forward purchasers. As a result, a portion of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program that is used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility will be received by these affiliates. Because an affiliate may receive a portion of the net proceeds from any of these sales, each of our agents may have an interest in these sales beyond the sales commission it will receive. This could result in a conflict of interest and cause such agents to act in a manner that is not in the best interests of us or our investors in connection with any sale of shares of our common stock under our ATM Program.\nOur access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions, the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential, financial stability, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions, covenants and limitations imposed under our Second Restated Credit Agreement and our senior unsecured notes, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk and there can be no assurances that we will manage or mitigate this risk effectively.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily as a result of our Second Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings under our Second Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our Second Restated Credit Agreement. Our interest rate risk may materially change in the future if we increase our borrowings under the Second Restated Credit Agreement or amend our Second Restated Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes, seek other sources of debt or equity capital or refinance our outstanding indebtedness. A significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms. For additional information with respect to interest rate risk, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nWe may be adversely affected by the transition from LIBOR.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, to identify an alternative reference rate. ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as the recommended alternative reference rate for USD-LIBOR in derivative and other financial contracts and proposed a paced transition plan to transition USD-LIBOR to SOFR. The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the administrator of LIBOR) announced that it would consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month USD-LIBOR tenors only on December 31, 2021 and all other USD-LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. On March 5, 2021, the IBA issued a statement, based on such consultation,\nannouncing that the IBA shall cease publication of the respective USD-LIBOR tenors immediately after the foregoing dates and the FCA issued a statement that it has no intention to use its proposed powers to compel the IBA to publish any of the foregoing USD-LIBOR tenors and that such USD-LIBOR tenors shall no longer be representative after such dates. The Revolving Facility includes customary LIBOR transition language that addresses the succession of LIBOR at a future date.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $60,000,000 of borrowings based on LIBOR. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt, which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Investment Strategy\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our investment strategy. We cannot assure that our portfolio of properties will expand at all, or if it will expand at any specified rate or to any specified size. As part of our overall growth strategy, we regularly review acquisition, financing and redevelopment opportunities, and we expect to continue to pursue investments that we believe will benefit our financial performance. We cannot assure that investment opportunities which meet our investment criteria will be available. Pursuing our investment opportunities may result in additional debt or new equity issuances, that may initially be dilutive to our net income, and such investments may not perform as we expect or produce the returns that we anticipate (including, without limitation, as a result of tenant bankruptcies, tenant concessions, our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating expenses). Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate investments into our existing portfolio without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. To the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such investments, we will require other sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, to the extent that we increase the size of our portfolio, we may not be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems, or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate investments into our portfolio or manage any future investments without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Moreover, our continued growth will require increased investment in management personnel, professional fees, other personnel, financial and management systems and controls and facilities, which will result in additional operating expenses. Under the circumstances described above, our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect to acquire new properties and this may create risks.\nWe may acquire properties when we believe that an acquisition matches our business and investment strategies. These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline after we acquire them, or that they may not perform as expected. Further, if financed by additional debt or new equity issuances, our acquisition of properties may result in stockholder dilution. Our acquisition of properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of such acquisitions. We face competition in pursuing these acquisitions and we may not succeed in leasing acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of their acquisition and operations.\nNewly acquired properties may require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nWe are pursuing redevelopment opportunities and this creates risks to our Company.\nWe have commenced a program to redevelop certain of our properties, and to recapture select properties from our net lease portfolio in order to redevelop such properties, for either a new convenience and gasoline use or for alternative single tenant net lease retail uses. The success at each stage of our redevelopment program is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including our ability to identify and extract qualified sites from our portfolio and successfully prepare and market them for alternative uses, and project development issues, including those relating to planning, zoning, licensing, permitting, third party and governmental authorizations, changes in local market conditions, increases in construction costs, the availability and cost of financing, and issues arising from possible discovery of new environmental contamination and the need to conduct environmental remediation. Occupancy rates and rents at any particular redeveloped property may fail to meet our original expectations for reasons beyond our control, including changes in market and economic conditions and the development by competitors of competing properties. We could experience increased and unexpected costs or significant delays or abandonment of some or all of these redevelopment opportunities. For any of the above-described reasons, and others, we may determine to abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore or with respect to which we have commenced redevelopment efforts and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redevelop and lease any of our identified opportunities or that our overall\nredevelopment program will be successful. Consequences arising from or in connection with any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Status as a REIT\nFailure to qualify as a REIT under the federal income tax laws would have adverse consequences to our stockholders. Uncertain tax matters may have a significant impact on the results of operations for any single fiscal year or interim period or may cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under the federal income tax laws beginning January 1, 2001. To qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other requirements such as those related to the composition of our assets and gross income, distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, including taxable income that is accrued by us without a corresponding receipt of cash. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on qualifying REIT income, provided that distributions to our stockholders equal at least the amount of our taxable income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. But, we may have to borrow money or sell assets to satisfy such distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet the requirements, we may be subject to federal income tax, excise taxes, penalties and interest or we may have to pay a deficiency dividend. We may have to borrow money or sell assets to pay such a deficiency dividend.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. We cannot give any assurance that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements relating to our qualification. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will again be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years beginning before 2019, we could be required to pay significant income taxes and we would have less money available for our operations and distributions to stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. We could also be precluded from treatment as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification, and all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Loss of our REIT status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, ability to pay dividends or stock price.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement under our ATM program is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.\nIn the event that we elect to settle any forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price, we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the relevant Forward Purchaser. Under Section 1032 of the Code, generally, no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares, including pursuant to a \u201csecurities futures contract,\u201d as defined in the Code by reference to the Exchange Act. Although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our stock would qualify for the exemption under Section 1032 of the Code, because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as a \u201csecurities futures contract,\u201d the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain. In the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement, we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to REITs under the Code. In that case, we may be able to rely upon the relief provisions under the Code in order to avoid the loss of our REIT status. Even if the relief provisions apply, we will be subject to a 100% tax on the greater of (i) the excess of 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such income attributable to sources that qualify under the 75% test or (ii) the excess of 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) over the amount of such gross income attributable to sources that qualify under the 95% test, multiplied in either case by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. In the event that these relief provisions were not available, we could lose our REIT status under the Code.\nThere is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.\nBecause the IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any of such legislative actions may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their shareholders. Changes made by the TCJA and the CARES Act that could affect us and our shareholders include:\n\u2022\ntemporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;\n\u2022\npermanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, with a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%;\n\u2022\npermitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our shareholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will generally allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;\n\u2022\nreducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022\nlimiting our deduction for net operating losses to 80% of REIT taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020;\n\u2022\ngenerally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of a specified percentage (50% for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020 and 30% for subsequent taxable years) of a business\u2019s adjusted taxable income except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system for certain property); and\n\u2022\neliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.\nYou are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory, judicial or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.\nU.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, our tenants, the markets in which we operate, the price of our common stock and our results of operations, in ways, both positively and negatively, that are difficult to predict.\nCertain federal tax legislation more specifically described above (the \u201c2017 Legislation\u201d) included significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes. As a REIT, we are generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations if we distribute all of our income and comply with the various tax rules governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. The 2017 Legislation changed the way in which dividends paid on our stock are taxed by the holder of that stock and could impact the price of our common stock or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs. In addition, while certain elements of the 2017 Legislation do not impact us directly as a REIT, they could impact our tenants and the markets in which we operate in ways, both positive and negative, that are difficult to predict.\nProspective stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the 2017 Legislation and any other regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and the potential effects thereof on an investment in our common stock.\nIn order to preserve our REIT status, our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders.\nOur charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may (i) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 5.0% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain other constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of our common stock, which may discourage large investors from purchasing our stock. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nChanges in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock.\nAs with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded common stock are the following: our financial condition and performance and that of our significant tenants; the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential and potential future earnings; the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher\ndistribution rate in relation to the price paid for publicly traded securities; the extent of institutional investor interest in us; and general economic and financial market conditions.\nWe may change our dividend policy and the dividends we pay may be subject to significant volatility.\nThe decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant and the dividend paid may vary from expected amounts. Any change in our dividend policy could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, each of the Second Restated Credit Agreement and senior unsecured notes prohibit the payments of dividends during certain events of default. No assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends or that the amount of dividends we pay, if any, will not fluctuate significantly. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law (\u201cMGCL\u201d), our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if, after payment of the dividend, (i) we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or (ii) our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved, to satisfy the rights of any stockholders with liquidation preferences. There currently are no stockholders with liquidation preferences.\nNo assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends. Each of the Second Restated Credit Agreement our senior unsecured notes contain customary financial covenants such as availability, leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth, as well as limitations on restricted payments, which may limit our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends. As a result of the factors described above, we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, stock price and ability to pay dividends.\nFuture issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our equity securities.\nOur future growth depends upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance, the receipt of the net proceeds thereof and the use of such proceeds may have a dilutive effect on our expected earnings per share, funds from operations per share and adjusted funds from operations per share. The actual amount of such dilution cannot be determined at this time and will be based on numerous factors. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after an offering or the perception that such sales could occur.\nProvisions contained in a forward sale agreement under our ATM Program could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity or result in substantial cash payment obligations.\nIf we enter into one or more forward sale agreements in connection with the ATM Program, the relevant Forward Purchaser (as defined in such forward sale agreement) will have the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (with respect to all or any portion of the transaction under such forward sale agreement that the Forward Purchaser determines is affected by an event described below) and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser if:\n\u2022\nin such Forward Purchaser\u2019s good faith, commercially reasonable judgment, it or its affiliate (x) is unable to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement because an insufficient number of shares of our common stock have been made available for borrowing by securities lenders or (y) would incur a stock loan cost in excess of a specified threshold to hedge its exposure under such forward sale agreement;\n\u2022\nwe declare any dividend, issue or distribution on shares of our common stock (a) payable in cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (b) payable in securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction, or (c) payable in any other type of securities (other than shares of our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price;\n\u2022\ncertain ownership thresholds applicable to such Forward Purchaser and its affiliates are exceeded;\n\u2022\nan event is announced that if consummated would result in a specified extraordinary event (including certain mergers or tender offers, as well as certain events involving our nationalization, or insolvency, or a delisting of shares of our common stock) or the occurrence of a change in law under such forward sale agreement; or\n\u2022\ncertain other events of default or termination events occur, including, among others, any material misrepresentation made in connection with such forward sale agreement (each as more fully described in each forward sale agreement).\nA Forward Purchaser\u2019s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the physical settlement of any forward sale agreement and require us to physically settle on a date specified by such Forward Purchaser will be made irrespective of our interests, including our\nneed for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of shares of our common stock under the physical settlement provisions of the applicable forward sale agreement, irrespective of our capital needs, which would result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity.\nWe expect that settlement of any forward sale agreement will generally occur no later than the date specified in the particular forward sale agreement, which will be no earlier than three months or later than two years following the trade date of that forward sale agreement. However, any forward sale agreement may be settled earlier than that specified date in whole or in part at our option. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to elect physical, cash or net share settlement under each forward sale agreement. We intend to physically settle each forward sale agreement by delivery of shares of our common stock. However, we may elect to cash settle or net share settle such forward sale agreement. Delivery of shares of our common stock upon physical settlement (or, if we elect net share settlement of a particular forward sale agreement, upon such settlement to the extent we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock) will result in dilution to our earnings per share and return on equity. If we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of the shares of common stock underlying a particular forward sale agreement, we expect the applicable Forward Purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) to purchase a number of shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions over an unwind period to:\n\u2022\nreturn shares of our common stock to securities lenders in order to unwind such Forward Purchaser\u2019s hedge (after taking into consideration any shares of our common stock to be delivered by us to such Forward Purchaser, in the case of net share settlement); and\n\u2022\nif applicable, in the case of net share settlement, deliver shares of our common stock to us to the extent required in settlement of such forward sale agreement.\nThe purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with a Forward Purchaser or its affiliate unwinding such Forward Purchaser\u2019s hedge positions could cause the price of shares of our common stock to increase over such time (or prevent a decrease over such time), thereby increasing the amount of cash we would owe to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the amount of cash that such Forward Purchaser would owe to us) upon a cash settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement or increasing the number of shares of our common stock we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser (or decreasing the number of shares of our common stock that such Forward Purchaser would deliver to us) upon net share settlement of the relevant forward sale agreement.\nThe forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a particular forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor equal to the overnight bank rate less a spread and will be decreased based on amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the applicable forward sale agreement. If the overnight bank rate is less than the spread for a particular forward sale agreement on any day, the interest factor will result in a daily reduction of the applicable forward sale price. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under a particular forward sale agreement is above the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would pay the relevant Forward Purchaser under such forward sale agreement an amount in cash equal to the difference or, in the case of net share settlement, we would deliver to such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference. Thus, we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement. If the volume-weighted average price at which a particular Forward Purchaser (or its affiliate) is able to purchase (or is deemed able to purchase) shares during the applicable unwind period under that particular forward sale agreement is below the relevant forward sale price, in the case of cash settlement, we would be paid the difference in cash by the relevant Forward Purchaser under that particular forward sale agreement or, in the case of net share settlement, we would receive from such Forward Purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to the difference.\nIn case of our bankruptcy or insolvency, any forward sale agreement under our ATM Program that is in effect will automatically terminate, and we would not receive the expected proceeds from any forward sales of shares of our common stock.\nIf we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us institutes, or we consent to, a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors\u2019 rights, or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our winding-up or liquidation, or we consent to such a petition, any forward sale agreement that is then in effect will automatically terminate. If any such forward sale agreement so terminates under these circumstances, we would not be obligated to deliver to the relevant Forward Purchaser any shares of common stock not previously delivered, and the relevant Forward Purchaser would be discharged from its obligation to pay the applicable forward sale price per share in respect of any shares of common stock not previously settled under the applicable forward sale agreement. Therefore, to the extent that there are any shares of common stock with respect to which any forward sale agreement has not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, we would not receive the relevant forward sale price per share in respect of those shares of common stock.\nMaryland law may discourage a third-party from acquiring us.\nWe are subject to the provisions of the Maryland Business Combination Act (the \u201cBusiness Combination Act\u201d) which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Generally, pursuant to the Business Combination Act, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of a Maryland corporation\u2019s voting stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company or reducing the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our capital stock. Additionally, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one-tenth or more of the voting stock of a Maryland corporation. In our charter and bylaws, we have elected not to have the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of stock of our Company. However, in the case of the control share acquisition statute, our Board of Directors may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws, and may do so on a retroactive basis. Finally, the \u201cunsolicited takeovers\u201d provisions of the MGCL permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests; however, on February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors adopted a resolution prohibiting us from electing to be subject to the classified board provisions of Section 3-803 of the MGCL, unless such election is first approved by the stockholders of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.", "PERMNO": 62367, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "GTY"}
