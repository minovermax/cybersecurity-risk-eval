RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements as discussed above. Our business routinely encounters and addresses risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Generally\nOur financial condition as of December 31, 2017 raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going-concern.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $134.45 million and shareholders\u2019 deficit of approximately $2.90 million. To date, and subsequent to the recent sale of our last significant business unit, we have dedicated most of our financial resources to general and administrative expenses. At present, we are only generating de minimis income from our legacy operating activities.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 were approximately $0.95 million. We have historically financed our activities with cash from operations, the private placement of equity and debt securities, borrowings under lines of credit and, in the most recent periods with the sale of certain assets and business units.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered into the Contribution Agreement under which certain real estate investment properties were contributed to our company in exchange for the issuance of our capital stock. Closing of the Contribution Agreement occurred on May 17, 2017. However, the assets assumed in such contribution do not represent a business and are not producing cash flows and/or revenues.\nOn December 22, 2017, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with OFI, under which OFI may invest up to $15 million in our company in a series of closings, in exchange for which OFI will receive shares of our newly designated Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per share. On December 22, 2017, we completed the first closing under the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which OFI provided $1.5 million to us. On January 24, 2018, we completed a second closing under the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which OFI provided approximately $2.2 million to us in. Under the Purchase Agreement, OFI may, but is not obligated to, make additional investments in one or more subsequent closings until an aggregate amount of $15 million has been invested or the Purchase Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms. OFI has no obligation to continue to invest in our company, and there are restrictions placed by OFI on the use of these funds.\nWe will be required to obtain additional liquidity resources in order to support our operations. We are addressing our liquidity needs by seeking additional funding from lenders and investors. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financial resources required for the short and long-term support of our operations.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIf we need to raise additional funds to pursue our growth strategy or continue our operations, we may be unable to raise capital when needed.\nFrom time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to make acquisitions or other investments, to provide for capital expenditures, finance working capital requirements, continue our expansion, or increase liquidity. In addition, if our business plans change, general economic, financial or political conditions in our markets change, or other circumstances arise that have a material negative effect on our cash flow, the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as our conclusions as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital could change significantly.\nAny of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs, requiring us to raise additional capital, and we cannot predict the timing or amount of any such capital requirements at this time. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or at all, we may be unable to expand our business at the rate desired and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe are dependent upon dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company and our principal assets are the equity interests we hold in our subsidiaries, which own, either directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries, our real estate assets. As a result, we depend on dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Our existing subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be significantly restricted from paying dividends or otherwise making funds available to us pursuant to the agreements governing their financing arrangements. In addition, their ability to make payments to us will also depend on their earnings, business, tax considerations and legal restrictions, including applicable state corporate laws. We cannot assure you that the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, applicable laws or state regulation will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments to meet our financial obligations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our businesses could be disrupted which could harm our operating results.\nWe expect to experience growth in our business, both organically and through acquisitions. We expect to make significant investments to enable our future growth. Such growth may place a strain on our management and operations. Our ability to manage this growth will depend upon, among other factors, our ability to broaden our management team; our ability to attract, hire, train, motivate and retain skilled employees; and the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and other systems. Our future success is heavily dependent upon achieving such growth. Any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have outstanding litigation which we may not be able to settle, or which we may not be able to settle on terms favorable to us.\nWe are involved in certain litigation relating to our former businesses, including a two product liability suits brought by a consumer regarding the no!no! product. We intend to vigorously defend claims brought against us, and to prosecute such suits to recoup sums owed to us. However, we may seek to settle such matters in order to avoid excessive legal fees and costs and the lengthy time such litigation may require in order to reach a resolution. However, there is no guarantee that we may be able to reach a settlement or resolution of such litigation, or that such a settlement or resolution will be reached in a manner that is advantageous to us, and in such cases we will need to proceed with litigation. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending matters. In addition to the pending matters, future litigation, government proceedings, labor disputes, or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations, which could involve a costly and lengthy draw upon our resources and could result in a resolution to the litigation which may be detrimental to us.\nWe are the subject of certain tax audits which may not be resolved without impacting our operations.\nWe have in the past, and are currently, the subject of certain audits by state agencies and international authorities for various tax matters including, but not limited to, sales and use and corporate income taxes, and unclaimed property reporting. While past audits have been resolved without significant impact upon us or our operations, there is no guarantee that future audits will be resolved in a manner that is satisfactory to us or that has no material impact upon our operations. Such results could include the payment of assessments which could impact our remaining resources and affect our ability to continue our operations in the existing manner.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services and the inability to attract personnel for these positions.\nWe believe that our growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our key management. Certain members of our management staff as well as other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time, with or without notice. There is substantial competition for personnel in the industries in which we operate, and we may face increased competition for such employees, resulting in the need to compensate these personnel at a higher-than-anticipated rate, a delay in replacing such personnel and integrating them into our operations, and the possibility that we may be unable to attract and retain these personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to product development or approval, loss of sales and diversion of management resources, and may have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to grow that business.\nIn particular, our success depends in part upon the continued service and performance of Mr. Vineet P. Bedi, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Matthew Stolzar, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer. We have fixed-term employment agreements with Messrs. Bedi and Stolzar; however, there are no assurances that the services of these individuals will be available to us for any specified period of time. The loss of the services of one or both of these officers could adversely affect our ability to develop and expand our business.\nAdditionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of Messrs. Bedi and Stolzar, our other executives or any of our employees. Our lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss of the services of our key employees, which could affect our ability to maintain the level of services formerly provided by those persons.\nIn our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees. If we are unable to attract key personnel in a timely manner, including key personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships in the regions in which we operate, it may have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to drive growth.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited as a result of \u201cownership changes\u201d of our company caused by the Contribution Transaction. In addition, the amount of such carryforwards could be subject to adjustment in the event of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, as a result of the acquisition, the amount of our pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, that may be utilized to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the applicable testing period (generally three years). The annual limitation generally is determined by multiplying the value of the corporation\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limits, be carried over to later years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by recognized built-in gains or reduced by recognized built-in losses in the assets held by the corporation at the time of the ownership change. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nOur NOLs, which for federal income tax purposes expire over the next 20 years, may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code as a result of the completion of the Contribution Transaction. Consequently, our ability to utilize our pre-change NOLs may be subject to an additional layer of limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Code. The amount of the NOL carryforwards is subject to review and audit by the Internal Revenue Service and there can be no assurance that the benefit of such NOL carryforwards will be fully realized.\nWe are analyzing the tax implications of the ownership of our inactive subsidiaries in Israel and Europe, including the tax implications of dissolving or otherwise disposing of such subsidiaries. As a result of the application of Israeli and/or European tax laws, the dissolution or other disposition of these subsidiaries may result in a significant tax in such foreign jurisdictions and/or a significant tax in the United States which may not be covered by our NOLs or result in the loss of our NOLs.\nCertain of our subsidiaries, both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, are participants in intercompany loans which originated at one of the foreign jurisdiction subsidiaries. The foreign subsidiaries could incur a tax liability as a result of holding those open loans. The subsidiary companies are not in a position to repay those loans in full. We and our subsidiaries\u2019 boards are examining how best to proceed, but to either repay a loan, or to default and have the loan forgiven, could result in income being imputed to that subsidiary in the United States. While we and various subsidiaries hold large amounts of NOLs on a Federal level, the use of certain of those losses is restricted under Section 382 of the Code as a result of past changes of control of our company, and the transactions which occurred during 2017 may impose further restrictions on the use of these NOLs should those transactions have resulted in a change of control during 2017. Accordingly, we may be subject to significant and unexpected tax liability in Israel, Europe and/or the United States and such liability would have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.\nThe Contribution Transaction may not qualify for special tax treatment, for example, as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, resulting in certain stockholders\u2019 recognition of taxable gain or loss in respect of their stock.\nThere is currently no opinion as to whether the Contribution Transaction will qualify for special tax treatment, as, for example, a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, there is no requirement we take all actions to ensure that the Contribution Transaction so qualifies and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the Contribution Transaction will qualify for any certain tax treatment, including as a tax-free reorganization, or that the Internal Revenue Service or the courts will not assert that the Contribution Transaction fails to qualify as such. If the Contribution Transaction does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization, some holders of stock may be required to recognize gain or loss or incur other taxable consequences as a result of the Contribution Transaction.\nIf the Company fails to manage and protect its and its subsidiaries\u2019 network security and underlying data effectively, its businesses could be exposed to a cyber-attack or other disruption which could harm its operating results.\nLike other corporations, the Company relies upon a variety of information technology systems to transmit, process and store information in an electronic format for use in daily operations. In particular, the Company possesses and uses personal information in the conduct of its business, including credit card, insurance and banking information of our customers and vendors. The size, inter-relationship and complexity of these systems, and the possession of such information, makes us vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, theft or loss of data privacy or other significant interference with the use and possession of such information, that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of network security or other interception of this information, could expose the Company to costly litigation, damage its reputation and result in greater expenses.\nOur information systems require a constant and ongoing dedication of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance our existing systems as well as keep pace with changes in information processing technology and regulatory standards. In particular, maintaining the Company\u2019s network security is of critical importance because the systems may store proprietary and confidential customer and vendor data such as names, addresses, other personal information, bank account and credit card numbers. The Company uses commercially available encryption technology to transmit personal information when taking orders. However, third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures by developing and deploying viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that are designed to attack or attempt to infiltrate its systems and networks. Employee error, malfeasance or other mistakes in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of customer or employee privacy. The Company employs contractors who may have access to the personal information of customers, vendors and employees. It is possible such individuals could circumvent the Company\u2019s data security controls, which could result in a breach of privacy. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our systems to obtain data relating to our business plans, products or proprietary technology. Any failure to maintain or protect these information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to data, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations.\nWe are subject to the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as similar anti-corruption laws in foreign jurisdictions around the world, generally prohibit companies, their subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors and/or intermediaries, from offering and/or making improper payments, or providing anything of value, to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage in business matters. Certain parts of the world have experienced, or are continuing to experience, some measure of governmental corruption; while in other parts of the world, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local business customs and practices. Both the real estate business and the healthcare business are subject to particular scrutiny in such matters, due to the requirements of numerous governmental approvals for real estate development and the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world. The Company has established formal policies and procedures that prohibit, and monitor for, conduct which may violate these laws, but we cannot guarantee that employees, affiliates, representatives and/or agents of the Company will not engage in conduct that violates these laws and for which the Company may be held responsible.\nRisks Relating to Our Real Estate Business\nWe have initiated an internal investigation into the validity of our subsidiary\u2019s 17.9133% ownership interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC, the owner of property located in Los Lunas, New Mexico. If our investigation ultimately determines that issues exist relating to the validity of our ownership interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC, our financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nOn January 12, 2018, we received a copy of a complaint, dated November 17, 2017, that was filed by Alpha Alpha, LLC in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court in the County of Valencia in the State of New Mexico against Avalon Jubilee, LLC, the holding company that owns the property in Los Lunas, New Mexico, HiTex, LLC, MCBB, LLC, Land Strategies, LLC, Ronald R. Cobb and John Does 1 - 5. The suit asks the court to, among other things, determine whether there have been unauthorized transfers of interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC; and declare who are the holders of interests in Avalon Jubilee LLC. Although the complaint does not name our company or any of its subsidiaries or specifically question our interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC, it raises questions about whether the transfers of interest leading to our acquisition of our interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC were properly made in accordance with the Avalon Jubilee operating agreement. We have begun an internal investigation into the validity of our ownership interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC and will disclose the results of that investigation once it has been completed. Accordingly, we may be required to engage in costly litigation to validate our interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC. Alternatively, a court may ultimately determine that we do not own such interest in which our financial condition will be materially adversely affected as we will no longer be the owner of what we believe is a material asset of ours and be left only with potential claims against the transferors of such assets, which may not result in a full recovery of our losses. Either costly litigation or the loss of a material asset and the inability to fully recover such loss through lawsuits against the transferees of our interest in Avalon Jubilee LLC would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.\nLitigation against us or the Contributor Parties regarding the acquisition from the Contributor could result in the payment of damages which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf any plaintiffs in a litigation against us or the Contributor Parties, or any of their respective directors, secures relief adversely affecting our acquisition under the Contribution Agreement, such relief may result in our company becoming liable for damages related to one or more of the properties acquired from the Contributor. In addition, we could incur significant costs in connection with lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers.\nWe are entering into a new business line and, therefore, there is only a limited history upon which investors can evaluate our performance and our future business prospects.\nWe have entered into the Contribution Agreement with the Contributor and the Contributor Parent, pursuant to which the Contributor has contributed real estate assets to our company. This Contribution Agreement represents a new business line for our company, which has no experience in the real estate sector. We will be relying on the experience of our management team for the operation and development of this business line. As a result, our business will be subject to the substantial risks which are found in the early stages of a new business venture operating in the competitive real estate industry. Our future growth and development prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by all companies in such situations, and in particular those companies which operate a business, such as real estate investment, in competitive environments that can be greatly affected by changes in economic conditions.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired real estate business.\nA successful integration of the operations of the real estate development business into our company will require that we devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices, operations, and support functions into a public company structure. The challenges we may encounter include preserving customer, supplier, and other important relationships, addressing differences in business cultures, preserving employee morale, and retaining key employees while maintaining focus on meeting our operational and financial goals and the real estate development business, and adequately addressing other business integration issues. The process of integrating a real estate development business, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business efforts, and any subsequent delays in the integration process, could adversely affect our business and financial performance and the market price of our stock.\nWe are subject to demand fluctuations in the real estate industry. Any reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDemand for properties similar to those owned by us and expected to be owned by us is subject to fluctuations that are often due to factors outside our control. We are not able to predict the course of the real estate markets or whether the current favorable trends in those markets can, or will, continue. In the event of an economic downturn, our results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may incur significant inventory impairments and other write-offs, a major decline in our gross margins from past levels, and substantial losses from operations of this business.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where our real estate investments are or may be made and where prospective purchasers and utilizers of these properties live could reduce the demand for and utilization of these properties and, therefore, adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe real estate investment business in which we have become involved as a result of our signing of the Contribution Agreement will be conducted in the United States and may also be conducted in various global locales. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets, and in the markets where prospective purchasers and utilizers of our to-be-acquired properties live, could negatively impact those properties and their profitability. Unfavorable changes in job growth, employment levels, consumer income and spending patterns, a decline in consumer confidence, increases in interest rates, and an oversupply of similar properties, could reduce the demand, and depress the prices we may ask, for these properties, resulting in lower sales and income from these properties and a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and other unforeseen and/or unplanned conditions could disrupt our real estate developments.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, and fires, could have serious impacts on our ability to develop and market individual real estate offerings. Properties that we look to acquire may also be affected by unforeseen planning, engineering, environmental, or geological conditions or problems, including conditions or problems which arise on third party properties adjacent to or in the vicinity of properties which we expect to own and which may result in unfavorable impacts on our prospective properties. As our proposed real estate investments may be located in multiple countries, with differing climates and geological characteristics, each property will face different known and unknown risks. Any adverse event or circumstance could cause a delay in, prevent the completion of, or increase the cost of, one or more of these properties expected to be developed and brought to market by us, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operations and financial results.\nIf the market value of our real estate investments decreases, our results of operations will also likely decrease.\nThe market value of each real estate investment will depend on market conditions both locally and globally. We expect to acquire land for each expansion into a new market at a cost based upon then-current economic conditions. If local and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, or if the demand for such properties decreases below the levels anticipated at the time of acquisition of a property, we may not be able to make a profit on such property comparable to those profits made by the Contributor and the Contributor Parent in the past. As a result of declining economic conditions, we may experience lower than anticipated or forecast results or profits, and/or may not be able to recover our costs of a project when a property is brought to market.\nWe rely on subcontractors to construct each property, and on building supply companies to provide components for each property\u2019s construction. The failure of one or more of these subcontractors to properly construct these facilities, or any defects in the components obtained from building supply companies, could adversely affect these properties, and thus our operations.\nWe engage and rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of the buildings upon each property we purchase. Also, we purchase the components used in our construction projects from third party independent building supply companies. We utilize industry standard quality control programs, but despite these programs, we may find that subcontractors are utilizing improper construction practices or the components purchased from building supply companies do not perform as specified in the project\u2019s plans. We may also find that our subcontractors are inadequately capitalized or have insufficient staffing to undertake the required work. In such events, we may incur substantial additional costs to repair substandard construction at our properties, to comply with the plans and local legal requirements. The cost of satisfying local legal building code obligations may be significant, and we may not be able to recover these costs from our subcontractors, suppliers and/or their respective insurers.\nLegal challenges or governmental regulations may delay the start or completion of construction on our projected real estate ventures, increase our expenses, or limit our construction activities, which could have a negative impact on operations.\nEach of our current and future real estate developments may experience a delay and/or increased expenses in construction, marketing and/or operation due to legal challenges to the development. These challenges may be brought by private parties or by governmental authorities, resulting in delays in the start or completion of each project\u2019s construction or requiring changes to the design or construction of each development. Any delay or change in a development\u2019s construction would result in increased expenses to us in the development of the property, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results with respect to that development and with respect to our overall operations.\nNumerous governmental authorities are typically involved in each new development project, and such authorities have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. Various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales, and similar matters apply to and/or affect the real estate development industry and govern matters including construction, marketing, sales, operation, lending, and other activities concerning each development. In the United States, there have been numerous changes in regulations that limit the availability or use of land, including regulations which limit growth in certain communities, the use of utilities including water and sewer outlets, road construction and utilization, and other related matters. Each jurisdiction in which we expect to invest in real estate development will have different and varying levels of regulation which must be taken into account when planning and implementing such developments. For example, we may be required to change or modify our plans due to alterations in local planning or laws. As a result, we could incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements with regard to each real estate development, negatively impacting our business by causing delays, increasing costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those locations.\nIf a development project experiences increased costs or shortages of labor or components, or other circumstances beyond our control, there could be delays or increased costs in developing such project, which could negatively impact our finances and operating results.\nWe may invest in real estate development projects in a number of countries and regions, including the United States Each project may be negatively impacted by local circumstances beyond our control, including labor shortages, disputes and work stoppages, union organizing activities, price changes and delays in availability of building materials and components, and a lack of adequate utility and road infrastructure and services. Any change in these circumstances could delay the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, one or more developments. We may not be able to recover any additional such costs through an increase in the prices for our properties, and therefore our operating results may be negatively affected.\nChanges in tax laws, taxes or fees may increase the cost of each development, and such changes could adversely impact our finances and operational results.\nEach development project will be subject to different tax laws, tax levies and governmental fees, depending upon its geographic location. Any increase or change in such laws, taxes, or fees, including real estate property taxes, and fees to fund schools, open space, utility and road improvements, could increase the cost of a development and thus have an adverse effect on our operations. Such changes could also negatively impact potential and/or actual users and purchasers of a development because potential buyers may factor such changes into their decisions to utilize or purchase a property.\nWe will incur significant advance costs in each real estate development before that development begins to generate revenue from sales and/or public usage, and as a result, we may not recover our costs in whole or in part, may recover those costs slower than originally anticipated, or may incur higher costs as a result of any delays in completion of a project, resulting in an adverse impact to our operating results.\nWe expect to make a number of significant cash outlays for each real estate development before the construction on that development begins, and considerably before any development begins to generate revenue. Such cash outlays will include expenditures to buy, rent, lease or otherwise acquire land, to plan, design and develop a property, to conduct site studies as necessary for development, to provide basic utility and infrastructure access to a property, to obtain permits, licenses, and other required regulatory approvals, to post surety bonds and such other construction guarantees as required by law, and to actually construct the project building(s) and to fully develop a property. These processes can take up to several years before a development is completed and ready to generate any revenue for us. The time to complete each development will vary, based on local geographic conditions, legal requirements, regulatory and community concerns, the ability to obtain required construction materials and labor, and other factors that may be unique to each project. We will face the risk that, during construction, demand for a project may change, alter or decline, and we may be forced to take steps to adjust to these changes in demand, including altering a project and its scope, and selling the property at lower than anticipated or planned prices or at prices that generate lower profit margins or losses. Inflation, economic changes or downturns, asset carrying costs (including interest on funds that are used to acquire land and/or construct a building) may also be generated and may be significant. As a result of these factors, we may experience adverse impacts on our operating results, and if a development experiences a significant decline in value, we may also be required to recognize material write-downs of the book value of a project building in accordance with GAAP.\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive and if other property developers are more successful or offer better value to customers, our business could suffer.\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive, regardless of locale, and we will face competitors in each location where we develop, construct, market, sell and/or operate real estate ventures. Competitors will range from small local companies to large international conglomerates with financial resources much greater than those of our company. We have to compete in each market for land, raw materials, construction components, financing, environmental resources, utilities, infrastructure, labor, skilled management, governmental permits and licensing and other factors critical to the successful development of each project. We compete against both new and existing developments and developers. Any increase in or change to any competitive factor could result in our inability to begin or complete development of a project in a timely manner, increased costs for the design, development and completion of a project, and/or higher costs and/or lower revenues from the marketing, sales and/or operation of a development. As a result, we may experience lower revenue and decreased profits due to these factors, impacting our operations and our overall financial results.\nFuture terrorist activity and/or international instability could adverse impact our real estate developments and financial operations.\nWe expect to operate real estate developments in a variety of locales, including the United States. A terrorist attack against the United States or other foreign country, an increase in terroristic threats or suspected activity, and/or an increase in domestic or international instability, whether or not located in a country in which we have real estate assets, could significantly affect our business by slowing, delaying or halting construction of real estate developments, increasing the cost of such developments, and/or reducing the sales and/or usages of such properties, thereby adversely affect our business.\nWe may incur environmental liabilities with respect to our development projects.\nThe properties we will target for investment will be subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site\u2019s environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. Environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Furthermore, under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs or removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of any required remediation and our liability therefor as to any property are generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of our company. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate contamination from such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell the real estate or to borrow using such property as collateral.\nIf we fail to diversify our real estate investment portfolio, downturns relating to certain geographic regions, types of assets, industries or business sectors may have a more significant adverse impact on our income and assets than if we had a diversified development property portfolio.\nWe are not required to observe specific diversification criteria. Therefore, our target portfolio may at times be concentrated in certain asset types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure or secured by assets concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations. To the extent that our real estate portfolio will be concentrated in limited geographic regions, types of assets, industries or business sectors, downturns relating generally to such region, type of asset, industry or business sector may result, for example, in tenants defaulting on their lease obligations at a number of properties within a short time period, which may reduce future projected net income and the value of our publicly traded securities and, accordingly, adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur co-venture partners, co-tenants or other partners in co-ownership arrangements could take actions that decrease the value of an investment to us and lower our valuation.\nCertain of the development properties could involve joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements with third parties having investment objectives that are may or may not be similar to those of our company for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties, as well as the acquisition of real estate-related investments. We also may purchase and develop properties in joint ventures or in partnerships, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with the sellers of the properties, affiliates of the sellers, developers or other persons. Such investments may involve risks not otherwise present with other forms of real estate investment, including, for example:\n\u25cf the possibility that a co-venturer, co-tenant or partner in an investment might become bankrupt;\n\u25cf the possibility that the investment may require additional capital that we or our partner do not have, which lack of capital could affect the performance of the investment or dilute our interest if the partner were to contribute our share of the capital;\n\u25cf the possibility that a co-venturer, co-tenant or partner in an investment might breach a loan agreement or other agreement or otherwise, by action or inaction, act in a way detrimental to us or the investment;\n\u25cf that such co-venturer, co-tenant or partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become inconsistent with the business interests or goals of our company;\n\u25cf the possibility that we may incur liabilities as the result of the action taken by our partner or co-investor;\n\u25cf that such co-venturer, co-tenant or partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; or\n\u25cf that such partner may exercise buy/sell rights that force us to either acquire the entire investment, or dispose of our share, at a time and price that may not be consistent with our investment objectives.\nAny of the above might subject a property to liabilities in excess of those contemplated and thus reduce our returns on that investment.\nUninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage may adversely affect the value of your stock.\nThe nature of the activities at certain properties could expose us and our operators to potential liability for personal injuries and, in certain instances, property damage claims. For instance, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pollution, environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods and snow storms that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. We may not carry all the usual and customary insurance policies which would be carried by a similarly-positioned company, and we may not be carrying those insurance policies in amounts and types sufficient to cover every risk which may be encountered by our company. Insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums we will pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Mortgage lenders generally insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial property owners as a condition for providing mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our planned to-be-acquired properties. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We cannot assure you that it will have adequate coverage for such losses. If any of our properties incur a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of our assets will be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss. In addition, other than the capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we do not expect to have any contingent sources of funding in place to repair or reconstruct any uninsured damaged property, and we cannot assure you that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in a decreased value attributed to our publicly traded stock.\nWe could face losses with respect to abandoned predevelopment costs.\nThe development process inherently requires that a large number of opportunities be pursued with only a few being developed and constructed. We may incur significant costs for predevelopment activity for projects that are abandoned that directly affect our results of operations. We expect to institute procedures and controls that are intended to minimize this risk, but it is likely that there will be predevelopment costs charged to expense on an ongoing basis.\nWe may not have adequate financing to fund our future property acquisitions and project developments, and such capital resources may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe implementation of our new business plan including the prospective acquisition of development properties and the completion of construction projects on such properties will involve considerable sums of capital. We currently do not have any such capital and will be required to raise acquisition, construction and related funds in the future on a project by project basis. We may not be successful in our efforts to raise such funds, or capital that we can acquire may not be reasonably priced. In such a case, we may not be able to successfully effect our new business plan. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, our future business prospects and our public market stock valuation.\nRisk Factors Relating to Legacy LHE Business\nWe are exposed to credit risk of some of our customers.\nWe accept payment for certain of our products through credit cards and customer financing and our exposure to these credit risks may increase during an economic slowdown. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. Future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have an effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements.\nSales of the LHE products may lead to potential product liability claims arising from the design, manufacture and marketing of these products. Such claims may be subject to many uncertainties and outcomes which are not predictable, and we may incur significant legal expenses in defending these claims regardless of whether we are found to be liable for the claims. While we carry certain product liability insurance coverages, the actual cost to us of any product liability claim could be materially different than the amount of the current coverages we carry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock Generally\nNotice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard\nOn February 20, 2018, we received written notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market that the closing bid price of our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days, and that we are therefore not in compliance with the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice provides us with an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until August 19, 2018, to regain compliance with the listing rules. We will regain compliance if the closing bid price of our common stock is $1.00 per share or higher for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days during this compliance period, as confirmed by written notification from Nasdaq.\nIf we do not achieve compliance by August 19, 2018, we expect that Nasdaq would provide notice that our securities are subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur stock price has been and continues to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock could fluctuate due to various factors. In addition to other factors described in this section, these factors may include, among others:\n\u25cf conversion of outstanding stock options or warrants;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new investments;\n\u25cf developments in existing or new litigation;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results; and\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock markets have, in recent years, experienced significant volume and price fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded. Market prices and the trading volume of our stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due to the matters described above, as well as economic and political conditions in the United States and worldwide, investors\u2019 attitudes towards our business prospects, and changes in the interests of the investing community. As a result, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be adversely affected and our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares or to sell them at desired prices.\nWe may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called \u201cpenny stocks\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. Our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and is subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1 million or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market, thus possibly making it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from this rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from this rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nOur future capital needs could result in dilution of your investment.\nOur Board of Directors may determine from time to time that there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities. These issuances would likely dilute the ownership interests of our current investors and may dilute the net tangible book value per share of our common stock. Investors in subsequent offerings may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current stockholders which may adversely impact our current stockholders.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, contractual arrangements, any limitations on payments of dividends present in any of our future debt agreements and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage for our common stock or may issue negative reports and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. It may be difficult for companies such as us, with smaller market capitalizations, to attract a sufficient number of securities analysts that will cover our common stock. If one or more of the analysts who elect to cover our company downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. This could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.\nNevada law and our charter documents contain provisions that could delay or prevent actual and potential changes in control, even if they would benefit stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred shares which may be issued with dividend, liquidation, voting and redemption rights senior to our common stock without prior approval by the stockholders. The preferred stock may be issued for such consideration as may be fixed from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our Board may issue such shares of preferred stock in one or more series, with such designations, preferences and rights or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated in the resolution of resolutions.\nThe issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock may be issued quickly with terms calculated to discourage, make more difficult, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. As a result, our Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue preferred stock may discourage the potential hostile acquirer, possibly resulting in beneficial negotiations. Negotiating with an unfriendly acquirer may result in, among other things, terms more favorable to us and our stockholders. Conversely, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect any market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of the common stock.\nThese and other provisions in the Nevada corporate statutes and our charter documents could delay or prevent actual and potential changes in control, even if they would benefit our stockholders", "PERMNO": 88258, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "GADS"}
