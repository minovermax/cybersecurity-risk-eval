{"cik": "1410471", "company": "IPC Healthcare, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. If we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective.\nThe healthcare industry is complex and intensely regulated at the federal, state, and local levels and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations.\nAs a company involved in the provision of healthcare services, we are subject to a myriad of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. There are significant costs involved in complying with these laws and regulations. Moreover, if we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal damages, fines, sanctions, or penalties, including exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We may also be required to change our method of operations. These consequences could be the result of current conduct or even conduct that occurred a number of years ago. We also could incur significant costs merely if we become the subject of an additional investigation or legal proceeding alleging a violation of these laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether a\nfederal, state, or local government will determine that we are not operating in accordance with law, or whether the laws will change in the future and impact our business. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more significant healthcare laws and regulations that affect us:\n\u2022\nfederal laws, including the federal False Claims Act, that provide for penalties against entities and individuals which knowingly or recklessly make claims for government funds that contain or are based upon false or fraudulent information;\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, that prohibits the knowing and willful offering, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for the referral or recommendation of patients for items and services covered, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Stark Law or physician self-referral law, that (subject to limited exceptions) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to an entity for the provision of certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or a member of such physician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship with the entity, and prohibits the entity from billing for services arising out of such prohibited referrals;\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act that provides for criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose known overpayments;\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act that provides for civil monetary penalties on healthcare providers who fail to repay known overpayments within 60 days of identification or the date any corresponding cost report was due, if applicable, and also allows improper retention of known overpayments to serve as a basis for False Claims Act violations;\n\u2022\nstate law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, which typically are not limited to relationships involving governmental payors;\n\u2022\nprovisions of, and regulations relating to, HIPAA that provide penalties for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud a health-care benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nprovisions of HIPAA and HITECH limiting how covered entities, business associates and business associate sub-contractors may use and disclose PHI and the security measures that must be taken in connection with protecting that information and related systems, as well as similar or more stringent state laws;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws that provide penalties for providers for billing and receiving payment from a governmental healthcare program for services unless the services are medically necessary and reasonable, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;\n\u2022\nfederal laws that provide for administrative sanctions, including civil monetary penalties for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federal healthcare programs, payments by hospitals to physicians for reducing or limiting services to Medicare or Medicaid patients , or employing or contracting with individuals or entities who/which are excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to enroll in the Medicare and Medicaid programs before submitting any claims for services, to promptly report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs, and to re-enroll in these programs when changes in direct or indirect ownership occur or in response to revalidation requests from Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit general business entities from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging in certain practices, such as splitting fees with physicians;\n\u2022\nlaws in some states that prohibit non-domiciled entities from owning and operating medical practices in their states;\n\u2022\nprovisions of the Social Security Act (emanating from the DRA) that require entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5 million or more from a single Medicaid program to provide their employees, contractors and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state false claims acts and related statutes, that establish a new Medicaid Integrity Program designed to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse , and that increase financial incentives for both states and individuals to bring fraud and abuse claims against healthcare companies; and\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations restricting the techniques that may be used to collect past due accounts from consumers, such as our patients, for services provided to the consumer.\nProviders in the healthcare industry are the subject of federal and state investigations, as well as payor audits and related derivative lawsuits.\nDue to our participation in government and private healthcare programs, we are sometimes involved in inquiries, reviews, audits and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing and documentation requirements. Federal and state government agencies have active civil and criminal enforcement efforts that include investigations of healthcare companies, and their executives and managers. Under certain circumstances, these investigations can also be initiated by private individuals under whistleblower provisions which may be incentivized by the possibility for private recoveries. The DRA revised federal law to further encourage these federal, state and individually-initiated investigations against healthcare companies.\nResponding to these audit and enforcement activities can be costly and disruptive to our business operations, even when the allegations are without merit. If we are subject to an audit or investigation and a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed, we may be required to repay these agencies or private payors, or we may be subjected to pre-payment reviews, which can be time-consuming and result in non-payment or delayed payment for the services we provide. We also may be subject to other financial sanctions or be required to modify our operations.\nOn June 7, 2010, we received a civil investigative demand (CID) issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ), U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois. The CID requested information concerning claims that we have submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. The CID covered the period from January 1, 2003, through June 4, 2010, and requested production of a range of documents relating to our Medicare and Medicaid participation, physician arrangements, operations, billings and compliance programs. We believe we have a strong compliance focus, and that we operate with appropriate billing policies, procedures, provider training, and compliance programs and controls. We produced responsive documents and were in contact with representatives of the DOJ who informed us that the inquiry related to a qui tam whistleblower action filed under court seal in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). We also were informed that several state attorneys general were examining our Medicaid claims in coordination with the DOJ.\nThough we cooperated with the government\u2019s investigation and would welcome a resolution to this matter, we are now in active litigation with the federal government regarding this matter and intend to contest the case vigorously. On December 6, 2013, the U.S. District Court partially lifted the seal on the civil False Claims Act case related to this investigation. The unsealed portions of the Court docket include the whistleblower\u2019s Complaint, which contains allegations of improper billing to Medicare and Medicaid, a Notice of Election to Intervene filed by the federal government and a Notice of Election to Decline Intervention filed by the State of Illinois and 12 other states that participated in the investigation. On June 16, 2014, the federal government filed its Complaint in Intervention against IPC and several of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court. The Complaint in Intervention contains allegations of improper billing to Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs from January 1, 2003 to the present, seeks to recover treble damages and civil penalties under the civil False Claims Act, and seeks to recover damages under the common law theories of payment by mistake and unjust enrichment. On August 13, 2014, IPC and the IPC subsidiary defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the Complaint in Intervention or, in the alternative, to sever claims against the defendants. The federal government filed its response on September 18, 2014, to which the defendants replied on September 25, 2014. The court\u2019s decision, which was filed on February 17, 2015, grants the motion to dismiss in part and denies it in part. The Court\u2019s Opinion and Order dismisses the 29 IPC subsidiary and affiliate defendants without prejudice, but the Court denies the request to dismiss IPC, which remains the sole defendant in the lawsuit.\nIt is not possible to predict when this matter may be resolved, the time or resources that we will need to devote to this litigation, or what impact, if any, the outcome of this matter might have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAlthough the underlying government lawsuit is still in an early stage and no liability has been found by a court, on October 20 and 24, 2014, shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against certain of our current and former directors and officers. We are named as a nominal defendant in both suits. The actions both assert alleged breaches of fiduciary duties related to our billing practices, and incorporate allegations from the False Claims Act case. The lawsuits seek a variety of relief, including monetary damages and injunctive relief. On December 4, 2014, the derivative lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit. The litigation is in an early stage and it is not possible to predict when this matter may be resolved, the time or resources that we will need to devote to this litigation, or what impact, if any, the outcome of this matter might have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by the failure of our affiliated clinicians to appropriately document services they provide.\nWe rely upon our affiliated clinicians to appropriately and accurately complete necessary medical record documentation and assign appropriate reimbursement codes for their services. Reimbursement to us is conditioned on our affiliated clinicians providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of\nservice provided, and the medical necessity for the services. If our affiliated clinicians have provided incorrect or incomplete documentation or selected inaccurate reimbursement codes, this could result in nonpayment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors and result in recoupments or refund demands, affecting revenue already received.\nOur business model includes the use of physician assistants and nurse practitioners (Midlevel Practitioners), which implicates supervision and documentation requirements, as well as additional billing rules which may not be applicable to physicians.\nWe utilize Midlevel Practitioners to provide care under the supervision of our physicians. State and federal laws require that such supervision be performed and documented using specific procedures. For example, in some states some or all of the Midlevel Practitioner\u2019s chart entries must be countersigned. Under applicable Medicare rules, in certain cases, a Midlevel Practitioner\u2019s services are reimbursed at a rate equal to 85% of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule amount. However, in certain circumstances when a Midlevel Practitioner assists a physician who is directly and personally involved in the patient\u2019s care, we may bill for the services of the physician at the full Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rates and do not bill separately for the Midlevel Practitioner\u2019s services. We believe our billing and documentation practices related to our use of Midlevel Practitioners comply with applicable state and federal laws, but we cannot assure you that enforcement authorities will not find that our practices violate such laws.\nWe may be subject to a data security breach that could disrupt our business operations and expose us to substantial liability and reputational harm. Further, compliance with federal and state privacy and information security laws is expensive, and we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches.\nWe process and maintain sensitive personal information, including health information and other personal information subject to federal and state regulations. We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and confidentiality of PHI, including HIPAA and HITECH, as well as laws governing our use of other personal information, such as social security numbers. As part of our medical record keeping, third-party billing, and other services, we collect and maintain PHI in paper and electronic format. Our IPC-Link \u00ae platform relies heavily on the electronic exchange of PHI. We also regularly collect sensitive personal information and maintain proprietary and other confidential information relating to our business, and we maintain sensitive personal information about our employees, such as their social security numbers, bank account details, and similar information. Despite our efforts to prevent security and privacy breaches and unauthorized use of such information, they may still occur. An unauthorized person may penetrate our security systems, misappropriate or compromise personal or other sensitive information, or cause disruptions to our business operations. The sensitive data stored on our systems and at our facilities may be lost, stolen, or compromised due to acts of vandalism or theft, human error, or some other event. Likewise, employees, unintentionally or intentionally, may exceed their authorized access to our information systems and inadvertently or maliciously misuse such information.\nThe cost to recover from and remediate a data security breach could be substantial. If any non-compliance with existing or new laws and regulations related to sensitive personal information and PHI results in privacy or security breaches, we could be subject to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or even criminal sanctions. We may incur significant costs in order to demonstrate and document whether there is a low probability that the sensitive personal information or PHI has been compromised in order to overcome the presumption that an impermissible use or disclosure of sensitive personal information or PHI results in a reportable breach. We may incur significant costs to notify the relevant individuals, government entities, and, in some cases, the media in the event of a breach and to provide appropriate remediation and monitoring to mitigate the possible damage done by any such breach. Given the sensitivity of the information we process, we may also experience a loss of commercial confidence, brand association, and goodwill in the event of a serious cybersecurity event.\nFurther, new privacy or security laws, whether implemented pursuant to federal or state action, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle sensitive personal information and healthcare-related data and communicate with payors. In addition, compliance with these standards could impose significant costs on us or limit our ability to offer services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us. In particular, as a result of the expanded scope of HIPAA through HITECH, we may incur significant costs in order to minimize the amount of \u201cunsecured PHI\u201d we handle and retain or to implement improved administrative, technical or physical safeguards to protect PHI.\nProviders must be properly enrolled in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, before they can receive reimbursement for providing services, and there may be delays in the enrollment process.\nEach time a new affiliated clinician joins us, we must enroll the affiliated clinician under our applicable group identification number for Medicare and Medicaid programs and for certain managed care and private insurance programs before we can receive reimbursement for services the clinician renders to beneficiaries of those programs. The estimated time to receive approval for the enrollment is sometimes difficult to predict and, in recent years, the Medicare program carriers often have not issued these numbers to our affiliated clinicians in a timely manner. These practices result in delayed reimbursement that may adversely affect our cash flow and revenues.\nWe may face malpractice and other lawsuits that may not be covered by insurance.\nMalpractice lawsuits are common in the healthcare industry. The medical malpractice legal environment varies greatly by state. The status of tort reform, availability of non-economic damages or the presence or absence of other statutes, such as elder abuse or vulnerable adult statutes, influence the incidence and severity of malpractice litigation. We may also be subject to other types of lawsuits which may involve large claims and significant defense costs. Many states have joint and several liability for all healthcare providers who deliver care to a patient and are at least partially liable. As a result, if one healthcare provider is found liable for medical malpractice for the provision of care to a particular patient, all other healthcare providers who furnished care to that same patient, including possibly our affiliated clinicians, may also share in the full liability which may be substantial.\nWe currently maintain liability insurance coverage to cover professional liability and other claims. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us, our affiliated professional organizations or our affiliated clinicians, and we cannot provide assurance that any future liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our professional liability insurance coverage generally must be renewed annually and may not continue to be available to us in future years at acceptable costs and on favorable terms.\nWe have established reserves for potential medical malpractice liability losses which are subject to inherent uncertainties and a deficiency in the established reserves may lead to a reduction in our net income.\nOur professional liability insurance policy, which ends December 31 of each year, is written on a claims-made basis providing first dollar coverage up to our policy limits on new claims reported in the policy period. We record estimates for our liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, for claims incurred and reported and claims incurred but not reported during the policy period, based on actuarial loss projections using historical loss patterns. These insurance reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty as they could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While claims are monitored closely when estimating reserves, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. The unpredictable nature of the reporting of claims could result in significant fluctuations in the loss estimate from period to period. It is possible that actual losses and related expenses may differ, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If subsequent actual paid claims exceed our estimated reserves, we may be required to increase reserves, which would lead to a reduction in our future net income.\nCompetition for hospitalists and post-acute clinicians is intense, and we may not be able to hire and retain clinicians to provide services.\nWe are dependent on our affiliated clinicians to provide services and generate revenue. We compete with many types of healthcare providers, including teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and other practice groups, for the services of clinicians. The limited number of residents entering the job market each year and the limited number of other licensed providers seeking to change employers makes it challenging to meet our hiring needs and may require us to contract locum tenens physicians or to increase clinician compensation in a manner that decreases our profit margins. The limited number of residents and other licensed providers also impacts our ability to recruit new clinicians with the expertise necessary to provide services within our business and our ability to renew contracts with existing clinicians on acceptable terms. If we do not do so, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected. Our clinician turnover rate increased in 2014, but generally remained stable over the prior three years. If the turnover rate were to increase significantly, our growth could be impeded.\nWe may be unable to enforce the non-competition covenants of departed affiliated clinicians.\nWe usually enter into employment agreements with our affiliated clinicians which typically can be terminated without cause by either party upon prior written notice. The law governing enforcement of non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state. Where it is allowed by applicable state law to do so, substantially all of our\naffiliated clinicians have agreed not to compete within a specified geographic area and at specific facilities for a one year period after termination of employment.\nAlthough we believe that the non-competition and other restrictive covenants of our affiliated clinicians are reasonable in scope and duration and therefore enforceable under applicable state law, courts and arbitrators in some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants applicable to physicians. If a substantial number of our affiliated clinicians leave and we are unable to enforce the non-competition covenants in the employment agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We cannot predict whether a court or arbitration panel would enforce these covenants and it could be costly to enforce such covenants.\nRestrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to our clients, which could adversely affect our ability to meet growth and revenue targets.\nWhile all of our affiliated clinicians have completed residencies in the United States, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 8% of our employed clinicians were not U.S. citizens. The ability of these affiliated clinicians to work in the United States depends on our ability to obtain the necessary work visas and work permits. Existing and proposed limitations on, and eligibility restrictions for, these visas could have a significant impact on our ability to recruit clinicians. Further, in response to recent global political events, the level of scrutiny in granting visas has increased. New security procedures may delay the issuance of visas and affect our ability to hire clinicians in a timely manner.\nOur reliance on work visas for a number of our affiliated clinicians makes us particularly vulnerable to legislative changes and strict enforcement of new national security procedures, as it affects our ability to hire clinicians who are not U.S. citizens. If we are not able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for these affiliated clinicians or encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas, our ability to recruit and retain clinicians and meet our growth and revenue targets could be adversely affected.\nWe may not make appropriate acquisitions, may fail to integrate them into our business, and/or these acquisitions may alter our current payor mix.\nOur business is partially dependent on locating and acquiring or partnering with medical practices or individual physicians to provide hospitalist and post-acute care services. As part of our acquisition strategy, we regularly review potential acquisition opportunities. We believe that there continue to be a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing such acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any such acquisitions would be. If we are not successful in finding attractive acquisition candidates that we can acquire on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot successfully complete and efficiently integrate those acquisitions that we identify, we will not be able to realize the benefit of this part of our growth strategy. Furthermore, our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or strategic opportunities or successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any suitable opportunities. In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. This competition may intensify due to the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry, which may increase our acquisition costs.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully and efficiently integrate completed acquisitions, including our recently completed acquisitions and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected. Integrating completed acquisitions into our existing operations involves numerous short-term and long-term risks, including diversion of our management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, failure to retain payor contracts and failure of the acquired practice to be financially successful.\n\u2022\nWe cannot be certain of the extent of any unknown or contingent liabilities of any acquired business, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws. We may incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses. Also, depending on the location of the acquisition, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations that may differ from those of the states in which our operations are currently conducted.\n\u2022\nWe may acquire individual or group medical practices that operate with lower profit margins as compared with our current or expected profit margins or which have a different payor mix than our other practice groups, which would reduce our profit margins. Depending upon the nature of the local healthcare market, we may not be able to implement our business model, which may negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022\nIf we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders could be diluted, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. If we finance an acquisition with debt, it could result in higher leverage and interest costs.\nAs a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, and we may increase our acquisition costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nChanges to the fair value of contingent consideration to be paid in connection with our acquisitions of physician practices may result in significant fluctuations to our results of operations.\nIn connection with our acquisition of physician practices, we have an established liability of $44.9 million as of December 31, 2014 representing our estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration to be paid. The fair value of such contingent considerations is re-evaluated on a quarterly basis based on changes in our estimate of future operating results and changes in market discount rates. Any changes in our estimated fair value are recognized in our results of operations. Because contingent consideration is generally based on multiples of operating results of the acquired practices during a measurement period, changes to our estimate of projected operating results of the acquired practices may have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nChanges in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements may adversely affect our operations.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from direct billings to governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies. As a result, any negative changes in the rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide would have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results. Government funding for healthcare programs, in particular, is subject to unpredictable statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy and determinations by intermediaries, and governmental funding restrictions, all of which could materially impact program coverage and reimbursements for our services.\nThe Medicare program reimburses for our services based upon the rates set forth in the annually updated Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which relies, in part, on the SGR. Many private payors use the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule to determine their own reimbursement rates. Based on the SGR, the annual Medicare Physician Fee Schedule update is adjusted to reflect the comparison of actual expenditures to target expenditures. Because one of the factors for calculating the SGR is linked to the growth in the U.S. GDP, the SGR formula may result in a negative payment update if growth in Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 use of services exceeds GDP growth, a situation which has occurred every year since 2002 and the reoccurrence of which we cannot predict. Congress has repeatedly intervened to delay the implementation of the negative SGR payment update. With the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 on December 26, 2013, the 20.1 percent cut that was to occur was replaced with a 0.5 percent increase for services provided through March 31, 2014. On April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was enacted, which extends the 0.5% update through December 31, 2014 and replaces it with a 0% update from January 1 through March 31, 2015. However, there is no guarantee that Congress will continue to postpone implementation of the negative SGR payment in the future.\nMoreover, the existing methodology may result in significant yearly fluctuations in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule amounts, which may be unrelated to changes in the actual costs of providing physician services. Unless Congress enacts a permanent change in the SGR methodology, the uncertainty regarding reimbursement rates and fluctuation will continue to exist.\nAnother provision that affects physician payments is an adjustment under the Medicare statute to reflect the geographic variation in the cost of delivering physician services, by comparing those costs to the national average. This concerns the \u201cwork\u201d component of the GPCI. If Congress does not block this adjustment, payments would be decreased to any geographic area with an index of less than 1.0. Although Congress has delayed the GPCI payment adjustment several times, most recently in the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which blocks the GPCI payment adjustment until April 1, 2015. However, there is no guarantee that Congress will block the adjustment in the future, which could result in a decrease in payments we receive for physician services.\nSection 5501(a) of the Affordable Care Act authorized a quarterly primary care incentive payment (PCIP) program to augment the Medicare payment for primary care services when furnished by primary care practitioners beginning in 2011. Incentive payments equal 10 percent of the Medicare paid amount for eligible primary care services. Unless extended, the PCIP payment program will end and further bonus payments under the program will be unavailable after December 31, 2015.\nCongress has a strong interest in reducing the federal debt, which may lead to new proposals designed to achieve savings by altering payment policies. The BCA established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was tasked with achieving a reduction in the federal debt level of at least $1.2 trillion. That Committee did not draft a proposal by the BCA\u2019s deadline. As a result, automatic cuts (sequestration) in various federal programs were scheduled to take place, beginning in\nJanuary 2013, although the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 delayed the BCA\u2019s automatic cuts until March 1, 2013. While the Medicare program\u2019s eligibility and scope of benefits are generally exempt from these cuts, Medicare payments to providers are not exempt. The BCA did, however, provide that the Medicare cuts to providers would not exceed two percent. President Obama issued the sequestration order on March 1, 2013, with cuts going into effect on April 1, 2013. Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended the two percent sequestration for Medicare for another two years, through 2023, and a bill signed by the President on February 15, 2014, further extended these cuts for an additional year, through fiscal year 2024. On January 21, 2014, President Obama signed the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill, modifying for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 the cuts that went into effect under the sequester on March 1, 2013.\nIn fact, the situation with the federal budget remains in flux. From October 1, 2013 through October 16, 2013, the U.S. federal government ceased majority of its operations after Congress failed to enact legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year 2014. On October 17, 2013, President Obama signed into law the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014, which included a continuing resolution to fund the government until January 15, 2014 and suspended the statutory debt ceiling until February 7, 2014. After extending the government funding expiration date to January 18, 2014, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that was signed into law on January 17, 2014 and funded the government through September 30, 2014. On December 9, 2014, Congress passed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, which funds the government through September 30, 2015, however, this new law is a temporary measure that does not resolve the debt-limit issue. Many Members of Congress have made public statements indicating that some or all of these budget-related deadlines should be used as leverage to negotiate additional cuts in federal spending. The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts.\nThe magnitude of Medicare cuts that may be made through budget agreements is unclear, including with respect to physician reimbursement. However, under our provider compensation plan, any decrease in reimbursement rates would reduce our physician incentive payments. For example, the BCA\u2019s automatic two percent net reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates for the codes applicable to the services performed by our affiliated clinicians could reduce our net income margin by approximately 0.2 percent.\nBecause governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenues from these programs by increasing the amount we charge for our services. If our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs. Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use and delivery of healthcare services as a result of budgetary constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. We believe that these trends in cost containment will continue. These cost containment measures and other market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, any increased costs that we experience. Our business and financial operations may be materially affected by these developments.\nIf we inadvertently employ or contract with an excluded person, we may face government sanctions.\nIndividuals and entities can be excluded from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for violating certain laws and regulations, or for other reasons such as the loss of a license in any state, even if the individual retains other licensure. This means that they (and all others) are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, and if the excluded individual is a physician, all services ordered (not just provided) by such physician are also non-covered and non-payable. Entities which employ or contract with excluded individuals are prohibited from billing the Medicare or Medicaid programs for the excluded individual\u2019s services, and are subject to civil monetary penalties if they do. The OIG maintains a list of excluded individuals and entities. Although we have instituted policies and procedures through our compliance program to minimize the risks, there can be no assurance that we will not inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or that any of our current employees or contracts will not become excluded in the future without our knowledge. If this occurs, we may be subject to substantial repayments and civil penalties and the hospitals at which we furnish services also may be subject to repayments and sanctions, for which they may seek recovery from us.\nThe acute hospitalist and post-acute care industry is competitive.\nThere are other companies and individuals currently providing acute hospitalist and post-acute care services. We compete directly with national, regional and local providers of inpatient healthcare, and other companies could enter the market in the future and divert some or all of our business. On a national basis our competitors include Team Health and Envision, each of which may have greater financial and other resources available to them. We also compete with hospitalist and post-acute care groups and privately-owned hospitalist companies in each of our local markets. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions, which would have an adverse impact on our growth strategy. Since there are virtually no capital expenditures\nrequired to enter the industry, there are few financial barriers to entry. Individual physicians, physician groups and companies in other healthcare industry segments, including hospitals with which we have contracts, some of which have greater financial, marketing and staffing resources, may become competitors in providing hospitalist and post-acute care services and this competition may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position.\nBecause patients do not typically select their hospitalists or post-acute clinicians, we are completely reliant on referrals from third parties.\nOur business is based on referrals for our services. We receive referrals from community medical providers, emergency departments, payors, and hospitals in the same manner as other medical professionals receive patient referrals. We do not provide compensation or other remuneration to our referral sources for referring patients to us. A decrease in these referrals due to competition, concerns about the quality of our services, and other factors could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and adversely impact our financial condition. Similarly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain preferred provider status with significant third-party payors in the communities where we operate. If we are unable to maintain our referral base or our preferred provider status with significant third-party payors, it may negatively impact our revenues and our financial performance.\nHospitals and other inpatient and post-acute care facilities (collectively \u201cfacilities\u201d) may terminate their agreements with us or reduce the fees they pay us.\nWe currently derive approximately 8% of our net revenue for hospitalist and post-acute care services from contracts directly with facilities. Our current partner facilities may decide not to renew our contracts, introduce unfavorable terms, or reduce fees paid to us. Any of these events may impact the ability of our practice groups to operate at such facilities, which would negatively impact our revenue and profitability.\nSome of the hospitals where our affiliated clinicians provide services may have their medical staff closed to non-contracted clinicians.\nIn general, our affiliated clinicians may only provide services in a hospital where they have certain credentials, called privileges, which are granted by the medical staff and controlled by legally binding medical staff bylaws of the hospital. The medical staff decides who will receive privileges, and the medical staff of the hospitals where we currently provide services or wish to provide services could decide that non-contracted hospitalists can no longer receive privileges to practice there. Such a decision would limit our ability to furnish services in a hospital, decrease the number of our affiliated clinicians who could provide services, or preclude us from entering new hospitals. In addition, hospitals may attempt to enter into exclusive contracts for hospitalist services, which would reduce access to certain populations of patients within the hospital.\nMany states prohibit business entities from owning or controlling medical practices.\nThe laws in many of the states in which we operate, or may operate in the future, prohibit business entities from practicing medicine and from exercising control over or employing physicians who practice medicine. This corporate practice of medicine prohibition is intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician\u2019s professional judgment. These and other laws may also prevent fee-splitting, which is the sharing of professional service income with non-professional or business interests. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. There is a risk that state authorities or courts may find that our relationships with our affiliated clinicians and our practice groups violate state corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions. In addition, authorities or courts could determine that we have not complied with new laws which may be enacted, rendering our arrangements illegal. If any of these events occur, we may be subject to fines and penalties, and changes in our business model may be required.\nWe may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.\nDue to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors or the uninsured may result in a reduction in our rates of reimbursement or an increase in our uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in our net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs or the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain with private insurance, changes in those programs could increase patient responsibility amounts, resulting in a greater risk for us of uncollectible receivables. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty collecting payments from third-party payors in a timely manner.\nWe derive significant revenue from third-party payors, and delays in payment or audits leading to refunds to payors may impact our net revenue. We assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed payments. In the current healthcare environment, payors are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare, including proposals to revise coverage and reimbursement policies. We may experience difficulties in collecting our revenue because third-party payors may seek to reduce or delay payment to which we believe we are entitled. If we are not paid fully and in a timely manner for such services or there is a finding that we were incorrectly paid, our revenues, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain federal and state laws may limit our effectiveness at collecting monies owed to us from patients.\nWe utilize third parties to collect from patients any co-payments and other payments for services that our clinicians provide to patients. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act restricts the methods that third-party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. State laws vary with respect to debt collection practices, although most state requirements are similar to those under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If our collection practices or those of our collection agencies are inconsistent with these standards, we may be subject to actual damages and penalties. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable changes or conditions could occur in the states where our operations are concentrated.\nApproximately 57% of our net revenue in 2014 was generated by our operations in five states. Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Texas accounted for approximately 8%, 16%, 7%, 10%, and 16%, respectively, of our revenue in 2014. Adverse changes or conditions affecting these states where our operations are concentrated, such as healthcare reforms, changes in laws and regulations, reduced Medicaid reimbursements and government investigations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, our business may be harmed.\nDue to the importance of the healthcare industry in the lives of all Americans, federal, state, and local legislative bodies frequently pass legislation and promulgate regulations relating to healthcare reform. It is reasonable to believe that there may be increased federal oversight and regulation of the healthcare industry in the future. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on our business. It is possible that future legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures could adversely affect our business or could change the operating environment of the hospitals and other facilities where our clinicians provide services. It is possible that the changes to the Medicare or other governmental healthcare program reimbursements may serve as precedent to possible changes in other payors\u2019 reimbursement policies in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursements could lead to adverse changes in Medicare and other governmental healthcare programs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business model depends on numerous complex management information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations and result in potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.\nWe depend on a complex, specialized, integrated management information system and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for our billing operations. We may be unable to enhance our existing management information systems or implement new management information systems where necessary. Additionally, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications, or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems. Our management information systems may require modifications, improvements, or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to implement these systems is subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist us in creating and implementing these systems. Our failure to successfully implement and maintain all of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our failure to successfully operate our billing systems could lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.\nWe may incur significant costs if we are required to adopt certain provisions under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act.\nHITECH was enacted into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among the many provisions of HITECH are those relating to the implementation and use of certified Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our patient medical records are maintained and under the custodianship of the healthcare facilities in which we operate. However, if we are required to adopt the use of EHRs utilized by these healthcare facilities, determine to adopt certain EHRs, or comply with any related provisions of HITECH, we may incur significant costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial position.\nWe are dependent upon our key management personnel for our future success.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management personnel, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Adam D. Singer, M.D., for the management of our business and implementation of our business strategy. We have entered into employment agreements with Dr. Singer as well as our other named executive officers. Our agreement with Dr. Singer has a three year term and the agreements with our other named executive officers have one year terms, in each case, subject to automatic renewals. We maintain key man life insurance on Dr. Singer in the amount of $3.0 million and IPC is the designated beneficiary of such policy. The loss of Dr. Singer or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nWe have experienced significant growth in our business and personnel over the years which we expect to continue. For example, from 2012 to 2014 our annual patient encounters increased from 5,496,000 to 7,068,000 and we increased our number of clinicians from 1,418 to 1,867. We have managed this growth by augmenting the staff of our corporate office and the staff of our 36 operating regions. However, we may be unable to effectively manage this growth going forward with respect to appropriate hiring, training and oversight of personnel, or appropriate integration into our systems. These events could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed.\nOur intellectual property rights, including those rights related to IPC-Link\u00ae and certain trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, are important assets for us. We do not hold any patents protecting our intellectual property. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our business. For example, we may be subject to third-party intellectual property rights claims, and our technologies may not be able to withstand any such claims. Regardless of the merits of the claims, any intellectual property claims could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, if any claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our practices that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We also may have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses or may not be available to us at all. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nWe might need to raise additional capital, which might not be available.\nWe may require additional equity or debt financing for additional working capital, to consummate acquisitions or if we suffer significant losses. In the event additional financing is unavailable to us, we may be unable to expand or make acquisitions and the price of our common stock may decline.\nThe terms of our debt agreement could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions.\nOur existing secured debt agreement contains, and any future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. Our existing debt agreement includes covenants, including requirements that:\n\u2022\ngenerally do not allow us to borrow additional amounts without the approval of our lenders;\n\u2022\nrequire us to notify our lender of, and grant security interests in, newly-acquired companies;\n\u2022\nallow us to dispose of assets only in accordance with the terms of our existing secured debt;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to pay dividends without the approval of our lenders; and\n\u2022\nwe do not impair our lenders\u2019 security interests in our assets.\nWe may write off intangible assets, such as goodwill.\nOur intangible assets, which consist primarily of goodwill related to our acquisitions, are subject to annual impairment testing. Under current accounting standards, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and we may be subject to impairment losses as circumstances change after an acquisition. If we record an impairment loss related to our goodwill, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year in which the impairment is recorded. The amount of goodwill recorded at December 31, 2014 is $409.0 million as compared to stockholders\u2019 equity of $367.9 million.\nOur quarterly results will likely fluctuate from period to period, which could increase the volatility in the price of our common stock.\nWe have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in revenue and net income. Absent the impact and timing of acquisitions, our net revenue has historically been higher in the first and fourth quarters of the year primarily due to the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe number of physicians we have on staff during the quarter, which may fluctuate based upon the timing of hires due to the end of the academic year for graduating resident physicians and the schedule of the Internal Medicine Board exams and terminations in our existing practices; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in patient encounters, which are impacted by hospital and post-acute census, which can be volatile, physician productivity and seasonality due to the higher occurrence of illnesses such as flu and pneumonia in patient populations in the first quarter.\nAs a result of the fluctuations caused by these factors and due to the timing of acquisitions, our results of operations for any quarter are not indicative of results of operations for any future period or full year. These variations in our results of operations could contribute to volatility in the price of our common stock. In addition, we have significant fixed operating costs, including physician practice salaries and benefits and, as a result, are highly dependent on patient encounters and the productivity of our affiliated clinicians to sustain profitability.\nProvisions in our charter documents could limit another party\u2019s ability to acquire us and deprive our investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their securities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain several provisions that may make it substantially more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. This may make it more difficult or expensive for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nOur ability to designate the rights and preferences of undesignated preferred stock could result in the issuance of stock with rights and preferences that are superior to those of our common stock, which could reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to designate by resolution, different classes and/or series of stock from the 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. Our board of directors is also empowered to fix the relative rights, preferences, privileges and limitations of each class or series of preferred stock. This means that our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences, including, among other things, dividend, liquidation, redemption and voting rights that are superior to the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of our common stock. In addition, we may issue other securities, such as convertible promissory notes, that may have rights and preferences that are superior to those of the shares of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors has the ability, without further stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of our common stock and securities exercisable for, convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our authorized capital stock. The ability of our board of directors to designate the rights and preferences of the preferred stock could impede or deter an unsolicited tender offer, merger or takeover of our business, or make a change of control of our company difficult to accomplish. In addition, the issuance of shares of our common stock or other securities having rights and preferences superior to those of our outstanding common stock could reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock, which means that capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 only source of gain.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our current, as well as any future, financing agreements may preclude us from\npaying any dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 92527, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "IPCM"}
