The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt.\nTo service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 the economic and competitive conditions in the asset-backed securities market;\n\u00b7 the performance of our current and future automobile contracts;\n\u00b7 the performance of our residual interests from our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities;\n\u00b7 any operating difficulties or pricing pressures we may experience;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain credit enhancement for our securitizations;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain dealer relationships;\n\u00b7 the passage of laws or regulations that affect us adversely;\n\u00b7 our ability to compete with our competitors; and\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire and finance automobile contracts.\nDepending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders.\nWe Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business.\nWe have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to:\n\u00b7 acquire automobile contracts;\n\u00b7 fund overcollateralization in warehouse credit facilities and securitizations;\n\u00b7 pay securitization fees and expenses;\n\u00b7 fund spread accounts in connection with securitizations;\n\u00b7 satisfy working capital requirements and pay operating expenses;\n\u00b7 pay taxes; and\n\u00b7 pay interest expense.\nHistorically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy.\nPeriods of Significant Losses.\nFrom time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005.\nWe expect to earn quarterly profits during 2016; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report, and also under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income throughout the four years ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our pretax income was $61.4 million, compared to pretax income of $52.2 million, $37.2 million and $9.2 million for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a pretax loss of $14.5 million for the year 2011. Our net income for 2015 was $34.7 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to net income of $29.5 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, $21.0 million, or $0.67 per diluted share and $69.4 million, or $2.72 per diluted share for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively, and a net loss of $14.5 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for 2011. Net income for 2012 includes an income tax benefit of $60.2 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, related to reversal of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. Such tax benefit cannot be expected to recur.\nOur Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms.\nOur business strategy requires that warehouse credit facilities be available in order to purchase significant volumes of receivables.\nHistorically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are \"warehoused\" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance of asset-backed notes. Upon issuance of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was renewed in August 2014, extending the revolving period to August 2016, and adding an amortization period through August 2017. In April 2015, we entered into a new $100 million facility with a revolving period extending to April 2017 followed by an amortization period to April 2019. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility with a revolving period extending to November 2017, followed by an amortization period to November 2019. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity\u201d.\nIf we are unable to maintain warehouse financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts.\nWe depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By \"permanent financing\" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 market conditions;\n\u00b7 the approval by all parties of the terms of the securitization;\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire a sufficient number of automobile contracts for securitization.\nAs stated elsewhere in this report, during 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Although we have seen improvements in the capital markets from 2010 and thereafter, as compared to 2008 and 2009, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we could expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities.\nWhen we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as \"excess spread cash flows.\"\nUnder the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities.\nWhile the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility:\n\u00b7 may require increased credit enhancement, including an increase in the amount required to be on deposit in the spread account to be accumulated for the particular pool; and\n\u00b7 in certain circumstances, may permit affected parties to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the securitized or warehoused contracts from us to an unaffiliated servicer.\nWe typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such higher than expected losses occurred in 2008 through 2010, which had an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. Should significant increases in losses reoccur, such recurrence might have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf We Are Unable to Obtain Credit Enhancement for Our Securitizations Upon Favorable Terms, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired.\nIn our securitizations from 1994 through 2008, we utilized credit enhancement in the form of one or more financial guaranty insurance policies issued by financial guaranty insurance companies. Each of these policies unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed timely interest and ultimate principal payments on the senior classes of the securities issued in those securitizations. These guarantees enabled those securities to achieve the highest credit rating available. This form of credit enhancement reduced the costs of our securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancement available to us at the time. Due to significantly reduced investor demand for securities carrying such a financial guaranty, this form of credit enhancement may not be economical for us in the future. The 19 securitization transactions we executed from 2010 through 2015 did not utilize financial guaranty insurance policies. Prior to the second quarter of 2014, none of the securities issued in those transactions received the highest possible credit rating from any rating agency. As we pursue future securitizations, we may not be able to obtain:\n\u00b7 credit enhancement in any form on terms acceptable to us, or at all; or\n\u00b7 similar highest available credit ratings for senior classes of securities to be issued in future securitizations.\nWe have observed an adverse trend in the greater credit spread between the interest rate payable on our securitization trust debt and risk-free investments. As of the date of this report, interest rates on risk-free debt are close to historical lows, which have offset some of the adverse effect on us of greater credit spreads. If interest rates on risk-free debt increase, or if the trend of increased spreads should continue, we would expect increased interest expense, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nThe automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Corporation. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us.\nIf Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nWe are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, no single dealer accounted for more than 0.75% and 0.40%, respectively, of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nWe specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks.\nIf automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated for securitizations that are accounted for as financings and warehoused automobile contracts. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us.\nIf We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired.\nWe are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including:\n\u00b7 our failure generally to observe and perform our responsibilities and other covenants;\n\u00b7 certain bankruptcy events; or\n\u00b7 the occurrence of certain events of default under the documents governing the facilities.\nThe loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio.\nIf We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nOur senior management team averages over 19 years of service with us. Charles E. Bradley, Jr., our President and CEO, has been our President since our formation in 1991. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nIf We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nFailure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things:\n\u00b7 require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications;\n\u00b7 limit the interest rates, fees and other charges we are allowed to charge;\n\u00b7 limit or prescribe certain other terms of our automobile contracts;\n\u00b7 require specific disclosures to our customers;\n\u00b7 define our rights to repossess and sell collateral; and\n\u00b7 maintain safeguards designed to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information.\nOur industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) has the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at its own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC has conducted an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. See Legal Proceedings - FTC Action. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. Our industry is also under investigation by the United States Department of Justice, which is conducting an inquiry that appears to be focused on securitization practices. In that inquiry, we received a subpoena in January 2015, which required that we produce specified documents. We are cooperating with that inquiry. Such inquiry could in the future result in the imposition of damages, fines or civil or criminal claims and/or penalties. No assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of the inquiry or any resulting proceeding(s), which might materially and adversely affect us.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with:\n\u00b7 applicable laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 changes in existing laws or regulations;\n\u00b7 changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations; or\n\u00b7 any additional laws or regulations that may be enacted in the future.\nRecent Legislation and Proposed Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank\"), adopted in 2010, mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. The law provides a regulatory framework and requires that regulators, some of which are new regulatory bodies created by Dodd-Frank, draft, review and approve more than 200 implementing regulations and conduct numerous studies that are likely to lead to still more regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act includes risk retention requirements. Six federal agencies have approved a rule implementing these requirements. The rule, which is set to become effective in December 2015, generally requires sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Our future securitization structures may be adversely affected by the risk retention requirement.\nCompliance with these new laws and regulations may be or likely will be costly and can affect operating results. Compliance requires forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nIf We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nWe operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages.\nWhile we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes.\nNegative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation.\nFrom time to time there are negative news stories about the \u201csub-prime\u201d credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees.\nIf We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nWe are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.\nA breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability\nWe hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security.\nIt is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations.\nSuch persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers.\nThese risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications.\nA successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe Have Substantial Indebtedness.\nWe currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,952.2 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $1,731.6 million of securitization trust debt, $196.5 million of warehouse lines of credit, $9.0 million of residual interest financing and $15.1 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition by, among other things:\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing amounts available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nAlthough we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors\u2019 exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nBecause We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired.\nThe terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following:\n\u00b7 incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 making capital expenditures in excess of agreed upon amounts;\n\u00b7 paying dividends or other distributions to our shareholders or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock or subordinated obligations;\n\u00b7 making investments;\n\u00b7 creating or permitting liens on our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 transferring or selling our assets;\n\u00b7 engaging in mergers or consolidations;\n\u00b7 permitting a change of control of our company;\n\u00b7 liquidating, winding up or dissolving our company;\n\u00b7 changing our name or the nature of our business, or the names or nature of the business of our subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7 engaging in transactions with our affiliates outside the normal course of business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due.\nIn addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings.\nRisks Related to General Factors\nIf The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nOur business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Florida and Pennsylvania, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us.\nOur Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters.\nOur automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us.\nIf an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired.\nOur profitability is largely determined by the difference, or \"spread,\" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded.\nOur stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2015, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 4,405,328 shares of our common stock, or approximately 17%.\nWe Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. See \"Dividend Policy\".\nForward-Looking Statements\nDiscussions of certain matters contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties.
