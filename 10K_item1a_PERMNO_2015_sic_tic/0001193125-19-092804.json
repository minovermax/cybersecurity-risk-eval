RISK FACTORS\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and ownership of our common stock is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results, and we may not achieve our expected operating results in the future.\nWhile we were originally formed as Anaplan, LLC in 2008 and first introduced our business planning platform in 2011, much of our growth has occurred over the last three years. Over the last three years we have hired new senior management, substantially increased our sales and customer success headcount, shifted our sales strategy to increase our focus on large global enterprises, which we define as companies that are members of the Forbes Global 2000, or Global 2000, and increased our reliance on partners to accelerate our sales process and provide implementation services. We have also substantially increased our engineering headcount and increased the frequency of our product enhancements and releases. As we have a limited history of operations at our current scale and under our current strategy, our ability to forecast our future operating results and plan for and model future growth is more limited than that of companies with longer operating histories and subject to a number of uncertainties. In addition, we have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing markets. If the assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, or if we do not execute on our strategy and manage these risks and uncertainties successfully, our operating results could differ materially from our expectations and those of securities analysts and investors, and our business could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each period since inception, including net losses of $131.0 million, $47.6 million, and $40.2 million, respectively, in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. We have an accumulated deficit of $343.2 million at January 31, 2019. Our losses and accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to acquire new customers and develop our platform. We expect our operating expenses to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we make investments and implement initiatives designed to grow our business, including:\n\u2022\nexpanding our sales and marketing organization to increase our overall customer base and expand sales within our current customer base;\n\u2022\nexpanding our offices and headcount internationally as we seek to continue to penetrate international markets;\n\u2022\ninvesting in research and development to improve the capabilities of our platform;\n\u2022\ngrowing our partner ecosystem;\n\u2022\nmaking additional investments to broaden and deepen our user community;\n\u2022\nexpanding our infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, to support future growth; and\n\u2022\ninvesting in legal, accounting, and other administrative functions necessary to support our operating as a public company.\nThese initiatives may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue, if at all, in an amount sufficient to offset these higher expenses and to achieve and sustain profitability. Growth of our revenue may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including a decrease in our ability to attract and retain customers, a failure to successfully implement our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy, a failure to increase our number of partners, increasing competition, decreasing growth of our overall market, privacy-related regulatory developments in the U.S. and abroad, or an inability to timely and cost-effectively introduce new products and services that are favorably received by customers and partners. Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also initially incur increased losses because costs associated with acquiring customers are generally incurred up front. In contrast, subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements that last typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. You should not consider our recent growth in revenue as indicative of our future performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations, as well as our key metrics discussed elsewhere in this report, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and deferred revenue, as well as other metrics such as billings that our analysts may use to evaluate our business, have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future, and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, key metrics and other metrics may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors. If we fail to meet these expectations for any particular period, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Factors that may cause these quarterly fluctuations include, without limitation, those listed below:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our existing customer base and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand use of our platform by existing customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to release platform updates and enhancements on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully compete in our markets;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of completion of professional services engagements;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in sales of our software subscriptions, which have historically been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year but may vary in future quarters;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages or security breaches;\n\u2022\nadverse litigation, judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, such as with respect to privacy; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry, and market conditions, both domestically and internationally.\nBecause we derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform, failure of Connected Planning solutions in general and our platform in particular to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue from our cloud-based enterprise planning and performance management software platform. As such, the market acceptance of cloud-based Connected Planning solutions in general and our platform in particular are critical to our continued success. Market acceptance of a cloud-based Connected Planning solution depends in part on market awareness of the benefits that Connected Planning can provide over legacy planning products, emerging point products and manual processes and organizations more broadly deploying planning solutions to their employees and across functional lines of business. In addition, in order for cloud-based Connected Planning solutions to be widely accepted, organizations must overcome any concerns with placing sensitive information on a cloud-based platform. The market for cloud-based Connected Planning solutions is at an early stage of development, and we cannot be sure that this market will expand in a manner that will support the growth of our business. In addition, demand for our platform in particular is affected by a number of other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include continued market acceptance of our platform, the pace at which existing customers realize benefits from the use of our platform and decide to expand deployment of our platform across their business, the extent to which our customers involve a wider group of employees in planning, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, technological change, the perception of ease of use, reliability and security, the pace at which enterprises transform their business planning and performance management capabilities, and developments in data privacy regulations. In addition, we expect that the planning and performance management and integration needs of our large and midsize enterprise customers will continue to rapidly change and increase in complexity. We will need to improve the functionality, ease of use, and performance of our platform continually to meet those rapidly changing, complex demands. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of Connected Planning solutions in general or our platform in particular, our business operations, financial results, and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, both domestically and internationally, the growth of our revenue will be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and our ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has\nalready invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional strategic planning and management solutions into its business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new products and services. Furthermore, as our industry matures or if competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell to new customers based on factors such as pricing, technology, and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, and our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and expanding their use of our platform. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the initial contract term expires, add additional authorized users to their subscriptions, and upgrade to a higher level of functionality on the platform. Our customers generally enter into agreements with two- to three- year subscription terms and have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Our customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices or terms or with the same or a greater number of authorized users or level of functionality. Some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us, and we may not be able to accurately predict renewal rates.\nIn addition, our growth strategy is a \u201cland-and-expand\u201d strategy that depends in substantial part on our customers expanding the use of our platform in their organizations through use by additional users, use across more functional areas of their organization, including finance, sales, supply chain, marketing, human resources, and operations, and the purchase of subscriptions providing additional features and functionality. To increase the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers, we will need to introduce new features and functionality to our platform to more comprehensively address the needs of customers deploying our platform to address a wider variety of use cases. If our customers do not realize benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, or if they do not believe that they will realize additional benefits through broader deployment of our platform in other functional areas of their organizations, or in other uses cases, our ability to increase our revenue will suffer. Achieving incremental sales to our current customer base requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. If we are not able to attract the attention of senior management, our sales efforts may not be effective and our ability to increase our revenue will suffer.\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends upon training our customers to effectively utilize our platform to unlock its full potential. Our failure to effectively educate, train and provide continuing guidance and support to our customers may adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur business requires our customers to be trained on our platform to effectively implement and increase adoption of our platform. Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business and financial condition. Our platform is designed to be deployed in a wide range of technological environments, and integrates data from a broad and complex range of workflows and systems. Our ability to support such large-scale\ndeployments using disparate technologies requires ongoing training in the proper use of our platform. In order to maximize the value of our platform we must continue to educate and train our customers to develop the skills necessary to harness the power of our platform. Without proper implementation and training, including training qualified professionals and developing a steady stream of skilled users of our platform, we may not be able to accelerate our business. Failure to develop a pipeline of qualified, highly trained professionals may adversely impact our financial performance. If our customers are unable to implement our platform, perceptions of our company and our platform may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or increase their purchases of our related services. Our customers and partners need regular training to derive the numerous benefits of our platform and maximize its potential without which our results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we experience a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nSecurity incidents have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems. These security incidents may be caused by or result in, but are not limited to, security breaches, computer malware or malicious software, computer hacking, denial of service attacks, security system control failures in our own systems or from vendors we use, email phishing, software vulnerabilities, social engineering, sabotage, and unintentional downloads of malware. Such security incidents, whether intentional or otherwise, may result from actions of hackers, criminals, nation states, vendors, employees, customers, or others. The techniques used to effect unauthorized penetration of computer systems are constantly evolving and have been increasing in sophistication. While we have security measures in place that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, these measures could be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient control measures to defend against these techniques. Our users may also disclose or lose control of their passwords, or use the same of similar passwords on third parties\u2019 systems, which could lead to unauthorized access to their accounts on our platform.\nWe may also experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems on our systems due to service attacks, unauthorized access, or other security-related incidents. For example, third parties may conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any successful denial of service attack could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our platform and damage to our brand.\nOur platform involves the storage and transmission of our customers\u2019 sensitive proprietary information, including their business and financial data. As a result, unauthorized access to customer data or security breaches could result in the loss, or unauthorized dissemination, of such data, which could seriously harm our or our customers\u2019 businesses and reputations. Any of these security incidents could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions, result in reputational damage or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our operating results. Any insurance coverage we may have related to security and privacy damages may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. These risks are likely to increase as we continue to grow the scale and functionality of our platform and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of our customers\u2019 information and data, which may include proprietary or confidential data or personal or identifying information.\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe market for business planning software is highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry for some software or services. Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control, including those factors set forth in \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our platform, as well as adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur competitors include Oracle Corporation, or Oracle, SAP AG, or SAP, and International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, which are well-established providers of business planning and analytics software with long-standing relationships with many customers. Some customers may be hesitant to adopt cloud-based software such as ours or to purchase cloud-based software from us and may prefer to purchase from such legacy software vendors. Oracle, SAP, and IBM are larger than we are and have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do. These vendors, as well as other competitors, may offer business planning software on a standalone basis at a low price or bundled as part of a larger product sale. Our competitors may also seek to partner with other leading cloud providers.\nWe also face competition from custom-built software vendors and from vendors of specific applications, some of which offer cloud-based solutions, including Callidus Software Inc., a subsidiary of SAP, in sales performance management and Adaptive Insights Inc., recently acquired by Workday, Inc., in mid-market finance applications. We may also face competition from a variety of vendors of cloud-based and on-premises software products that address only a portion of the use cases addressed by our platform, including spreadsheets, which are used by virtually every business to some degree for business planning. Some of these applications may have greater functionality than our platform for the specific use cases for which they were designed, even if they lack the breadth of planning capabilities provided by our platform. In addition, other companies that provide cloud-based software in different target markets may develop software or acquire companies that operate in our target markets, and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal software or simply use the manual processes that they have traditionally used. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services than we can. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, and major distribution agreements with consultants, systems integrators, and resellers. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our operating results would be negatively affected. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive market position, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our service.\nOur ability to increase our customer base, achieve broader market acceptance of our platform, grow our revenue, and achieve and sustain profitability will depend, to a significant extent, on our\nability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. Our sales and marketing expenses represent a significant percentage of our revenue, and our operating results will suffer if our sales and marketing expenditures do not contribute to increasing revenue as we anticipate. We are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers. Over the last two years we have substantially increased the size of our direct sales force, and accordingly many of the new members of our sales force have not yet become fully productive. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries can be costly, complex, and time-consuming, and requires additional set up and upfront costs that may be disproportionate to the initial revenue that we expect to receive from those countries. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel. Attrition rates may increase, and we may face integration challenges as we continue to seek to aggressively expand our sales force. Moreover, we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing overseas marketing campaigns, and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement. Our business will be harmed if our continuing investment in increasing our sales and marketing capabilities do not generate a significant increase in revenue.\nIf we fail to continue to enhance our platform and adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products, and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards and trends and continue to enhance our platform, introduce new functionality, update our infrastructure on a timely basis to broaden the appeal of our platform to potential new customers, provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, increase the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers, and keep pace with technological developments. The success of any enhancement, new functionality, or infrastructure development depends on several factors, including timely completion and market acceptance. Any new enhancement, functionality, or infrastructure development might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours at lower prices.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the planned release dates of enhancements to our platform. Delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our platform, any of which could cause us to lose existing customers or impair our ability to attract new customers. In addition, the introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our ability to compete. Any delay or failure in the introduction of enhancements, functionality, or infrastructure developments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platform must also integrate with a variety of third-party technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browser, and database technologies. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with existing or future technologies could reduce the demand for our platform, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business. Further, the emergence of new industry standards\nrelated to strategic planning and operational execution products and services may adversely affect the demand for our platform. In addition, because our platform is cloud-based, we need to continually enhance and improve our platform to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communications, and database technologies and standards. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with future hardware or software technologies, or to comply with new industry standards, could reduce the demand for our platform and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.\nWe have established strategic relationships with global strategic consulting firms, global systems integrators, regional consulting firms, implementation partners, and technology partners. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem by continuing to establish and maintain relationships with such third parties. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our platform by potential customers.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, we could incur increased operating expenses and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer adoption or usage of our platform or increased revenue.\nAdverse global economic and market conditions may negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in the United States and abroad. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or in regions globally like Europe and Asia, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, decreased government spending, perceived impact of global trade barriers like tariffs and sanctions and the corresponding retaliatory actions, economic uncertainty, or other difficulties may affect one or more of the sectors or countries in which we sell our platform. Global economic and political uncertainty, including the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, increased tariffs and international trade disputes, may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending, result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our international operations and cause customers to delay or reduce their technology spending. In addition, a strong dollar could reduce demand for our products in countries with relatively weaker currencies. These adverse conditions could result in reductions in the rate of enterprise software spending generally, sales of our platform, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, lower renewal rates, and increased price competition. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs, service outages, or disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.\nOur platform is complex, has contained defects and errors and may continue to contain undetected defects or errors. We are continuing to evolve the features and functionality of our platform through updates and enhancements, and as we do so, we may introduce additional defects or errors\nthat may not be detected until after deployment by our customers. In addition, if our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruptions in service may result. Moreover, if we acquire companies or integrate into our platform technologies developed by third parties, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the newly-obtained technologies into our platform and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our reputation. In addition, while we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems.\nSince our customers use our platform for important aspects of their business, any actual or perceived errors, defects, disruptions in service, outages, or other performance problems could damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Any defects or errors in our platform and solutions, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems could result in any of the following, each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations:\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects;\n\u2022\nloss of existing or potential customers or partners;\n\u2022\ninterruptions or delays in sales of our platform;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndelay in the development or release of new functionality or improvements to our platform;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which could harm our reputation;\n\u2022\nsales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and customer service resources;\n\u2022\nbreach of warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts; and\n\u2022\nan increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\nAlthough we have contractual protections, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, in our standard terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims by customers, partners or other third parties. Any insurance coverage we may have may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us, or cover only a portion of such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim against us could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management\u2019s time and other resources.\nInterruptions, delays in service or inability to increase capacity, including internationally, at our third-party data center facilities could impair the use or functionality of our platform, harm our business, and subject us to liability.\nWe currently serve our customers from third-party data center facilities operated by Equinix, Inc. located in California and Virginia in the United States, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Frankfurt in Germany. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could interrupt service or impair the use or functionality of our platform. In addition, as we continue to increase the number of customers and users on our platform, we will need to increase the capacity of our data center infrastructure, including internationally. If we do not increase our capacity in a timely manner, customers could experience\ninterruptions or delays in access to our platform, and we may not be able to attract potential customers in specific regions of the world unless we open data centers in those regions. As we continue to add data centers and capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the use or functionality of our platform. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems, or those of our third-party data centers, could result in impairment of or interruptions in service. Impairment of or interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our platform is unreliable.\nBecause our platform is sold to large and midsize enterprises with complex operating environments, we encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our platform by large and midsize enterprises. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete sales could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary significantly from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers\u2019 decision-making processes, procurement requirements, and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles;\n\u2022\nthe need by some customers for lengthy evaluations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, features, or functionality by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe length and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes.\nIn the enterprise market, a customer\u2019s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision, requiring us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating enterprise customers as to the use and value of our platform. In addition, our ability to successfully sell our platform to large and midsize enterprises is dependent on us attracting and retaining sales personnel with experience in selling to larger organizations. Moreover, our target customers may prefer to purchase software that is critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors. Our typical sales cycles can range from three to nine months, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or lengthen further. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the subscription term, downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts, which are typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters.\nAccordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of renewals, may not be fully apparent from our reported results of operations until future periods.\nIn addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenue is recognized over the life of the customer agreement. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements with them. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nIn addition, professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed or upon the completion of the project, depending on the type of professional services arrangement involved. Professional services engagements typically span from a few weeks to several months, which can make it difficult to predict the timing of revenue recognition for such services and the corresponding effects on our results of operations. Professional services revenue has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, as we are increasingly leveraging our partners to provide these services. In addition, because professional services expenses are recognized as the services are performed, professional services, and total margins can significantly fluctuate from period to period.\nThe sum of our revenue and changes in deferred revenue may not be an accurate indicator of business activity within a period.\nInvestors or analysts sometimes look to the sum of revenue and changes in deferred revenue, sometimes referred to as \u201cestimated billings,\u201d as an indicator of business activity in a period for businesses such as ours. However, these measures may significantly differ from underlying business activity for a number of reasons including:\n\u2022\na relatively large number of transactions occur at the end of the quarter. Invoicing of those transactions may or may not occur before the end of the quarter based on a number of factors including receipt of information from the customer, volume of transactions, and holidays. A shift of a few days has little economic impact on our business, but will shift deferred revenue from one period into the next;\n\u2022\nmulti-year upfront billings may distort trends;\n\u2022\nsubscriptions that have deferred start dates; and\n\u2022\nservices that are invoiced upon delivery.\nAccordingly, we do not believe that estimated billings is an accurate indicator of future revenue for any given period of time. However, many companies that provide subscriptions report changes in estimated billings as a key operating or financial metric, and it is possible that analysts or investors may view this metric as important. Thus, any changes in our estimated billings could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in our subscription or pricing models could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs the markets for our software subscriptions grow, as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours or as we enter into new international markets, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have historically used. Regardless of pricing model used, large customers may demand higher price discounts than in the past. As a result, we may be required to reduce our prices, offer shorter contract durations or offer alternative pricing models, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nWe have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our platform and services. In the past, we have been able to increase our prices for our platform and services, but we may choose not to introduce or be unsuccessful in implementing future price increases. Our competitors may introduce new products that compete with ours or reduce their prices, or we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on our historical pricing models. As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if our mix of products sold changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or change our pricing model, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and expect to continue to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. During this period, we also established operations in a number of countries outside the United States. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to significantly expand our operations and headcount in the near term, including internationally. We sell our platform to customers in 46 countries and have employees in North America, Europe and Asia. We plan to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively and execute our business plan. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures, and we will need to ensure that we maintain high levels of customer support. Failure to effectively manage growth and execute our business plan could result in difficulty or delays in increasing the size of our customer base, declines in quality of customer support or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely affect our business performance and results of operations.\nWe invest significantly in research and development, and to the extent our research and development investments are not directed efficiently or do not result in material enhancements to our platform, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nA key element of our strategy is to invest significantly in our research and development efforts to enhance the features, functionality, performance, and ease of use of our platform to address additional applications and use cases that will broaden the appeal of our platform and facilitate the broad use of our platform across the largest enterprise customers. If we do not spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling innovation and technologies, our business may be harmed and we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Moreover, research and development projects can be technically challenging and expensive. As a result of the nature of research and development cycles, there will be delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development activities and the time we are able to offer compelling enhancements to our platform and generate revenue, if any, from those activities. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a platform enhancement we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that do not lead to the successful introduction of functionality or platform improvements that are competitive in our current or future markets our business and results of operations will suffer.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with the implementation services provided by us or our partners.\nOur business depends on the professional services that are performed to help our customers use our platform. Professional services may be performed by our own staff, by a third-party partner or by a combination of the two. Our strategy is to work with partners to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers, and we expect the number of our partner-led implementations to continue to increase over time. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a partner or with the type of professional services or functionality delivered, even if we are not contractually responsible for the partner services, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our or our partner\u2019s services could damage our ability to expand the scope of functionality subscribed to by that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits, or we could face contract terminations, in which case we would be subject to refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unexcused downtime under our agreements with our customers. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, revenue, and operating results.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOnce our platform is implemented, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues or perceived technical issues relating to the platform. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform to existing and prospective customers and our business, operating results, and financial position.\nIf we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, and expedite the awareness of Connected Planning solutions, our revenue and competitive position may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing widespread awareness of our brand and Connected Planning solutions in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform, attracting new customers, and maintaining existing customers. For\nexample, widespread awareness of our brand is critical to ensuring that we are invited to participate in requests for proposals from prospective customers. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments to promote our brand. However, brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and, even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform. We believe that the importance of our brand and reputation will increase as competition in our market further intensifies.\nIn addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our platform, as well as the products and services of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors\u2019 products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. Additionally, the performance of our partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our partners\u2019 services. Negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our partners or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful. The upfront investment and costs incurred to build and maintain our brand, both domestically and internationally, may not generate increased market acceptance and may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and certain key employees, and the loss of any executive officer or key employee, or the inability to identify and recruit executive officers and key employees in a timely manner, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and certain key employees. We rely on our executive officers and key employees in the areas of business strategy, research and development, marketing, sales, services, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of executives or key employees, which could disrupt our business. We do not maintain key-man insurance for any member of our senior management team or any other employee. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Conversely, we may terminate the employment of the senior management team and certain key employees, which may subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and employment claims. Moreover, we may experience high levels of attrition after the expiration of the lock-up period in connection with our initial public offering, or IPO, when employees may receive significant proceeds from sales of our common stock in the public markets. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software for Internet-related services, and for direct sales personnel. In particular, competition is intense for experienced software and cloud infrastructure engineers in San Francisco in the United States and London and York in the U.K., our primary development locations. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for\nexperienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or our company have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and potentially in litigation. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur senior management team, including members of our financial and accounting staff, has worked at the company for a limited time.\nDespite having significant experience in their individual areas of expertise, several key members of our executive leadership team have a relatively short tenure with the Company. These members of management are critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, and overall business success. Because of these recent changes, our senior management team has not worked at the company for an extended period of time and may not be able to work together effectively to execute our business objectives.\nBecause our platform could be used to collect and store personal information, domestic and international privacy concerns could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nWe may collect, process, and store personal information for our customers and similar data about our employees and services providers. Additionally, our customers can use our platform to collect, process, and store certain types of personal or identifying information regarding their employees and customers. In most cases we contractually prohibit our customers from using our platform to collect, process, or store sensitive information (such as personal health information or credit card information); however, our customers may breach such use prohibitions without our knowledge. Such a breach could result in our violation of the laws, rules, or regulations governing the collection, use, and protection of personal information, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, as our customers face increased scrutiny for data privacy breaches, they may elect to transfer the risk to us through contractual provisions which may subject us to increasing levels of contractual liability for data privacy breaches.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where our platform is available. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The CCPA takes effect on January 1, 2020, and broadly defines personal information, extends expanded privacy rights and protections to California residents, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. In addition to California, many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws, rules, and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, data residency, security, and disclosure of personal information and breach notification procedures. Laws, rules, and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, data residency, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses. Interpretation of, and costs of compliance with, these laws, rules, and regulations and their application to our platform and services in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.\nIn the United States, these include laws, rules, and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and\nAbuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, or our customers, must comply. There may be substantial amounts of personally identifiable information or other sensitive information processed and stored on our platform.\nIn December 2015, European Union, or EU, institutions reached agreement on a draft regulation that was formally adopted in April 2016, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018, includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, and it replaces both the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive and supersedes applicable EU member state legislation.\nThe GDPR significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance from those in existing EU data protection law. EU data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines for violations of the GDPR of up to a maximum of \u008020 million or 4% of the data controller\u2019s or data processor\u2019s total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and actual or alleged violations of the GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. We have taken and will continue to take steps to cause our processes to be compliant with applicable portions of the GDPR, but the rules and regulations under the GDPR may not be fully articulated and we cannot assure you that our steps will be compliant. Our efforts to comply with the GDPR or other new data protection laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial operational costs, require us to modify our data handling practices), and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the EU, the United Kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the EU known as \u201cBrexit\u201d. This has created uncertainty with regard to the future regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective customers in Europe, including the United Kingdom, to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of European residents. The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of European residents\u2019 personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs, and could result in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed.\nWe have been certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield with respect to our transfer of certain personal data from the European Union to the United States. The Privacy Shield program is subject to annual review and may be challenged, suspended, or invalidated. At present, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework and the use of EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or the Model Clauses, to protect data exports between the European Union and the U.S. are both subject to ongoing legal challenges. These legal challenges may result in a ruling that the industry-standard measures we, and other companies, have taken are no longer sufficient. It is also possible that the Privacy Shield program may need to be updated by the European Commission and Department of Commerce to take into account the GDPR. Moreover, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the European Union to the United States and may be at risk of experiencing reluctance or refusal of European or multi-national customers to use our solutions and incurring regulatory penalties, which may have an adverse effect on our business. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates, and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, and other standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, rules, regulations, and other standards\u2019 actual or alleged legal obligations, such as contractual or self-regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our platform. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and\npractices or modify our platform, which we may be unable to do in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we were to fail to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations, or to protect our customers\u2019 data, or were perceived to have failed to comply with these obligations, we could be subject to enforcement action against us, including fines, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our software particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nOur global operations and sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations subject us to risks inherent in international operations that can harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA key element of our strategy is to operate globally and sell our products to customers across the world. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers located outside the United States. Operating globally requires significant resources and management attention and subject us to regulatory, economic, geographic, and political risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having operations in many countries;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nvariations in adoption and acceptance of cloud computing in different countries, requirements or preferences for domestic products, and difficulties in replacing products offered by more established or known regional competitors;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ndiffering technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;\n\u2022\ncommunication and integration problems related to entering and serving new markets with different languages, cultures, and political systems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign privacy and security laws and regulations, including data privacy laws that require customer data to be stored and processed in a designated territory, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Travel Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act), import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\nweak economic conditions in certain countries or regions and general economic uncertainty around the world;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting and hiring employees in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe preference for localized software and licensing programs;\n\u2022\nthe preference for localized language support;\n\u2022\nunstable regional and economic political conditions;\n\u2022\nweaker protection in some jurisdictions for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe fragmentation of longstanding regulatory frameworks caused by Brexit.\nAny of the above risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our revenue from customers outside of the United States or increase our operating costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties generally include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, those limitations may not be fully enforceable in all situations, and we may still incur substantial liability under those agreements. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWhile our international contracts are sometimes denominated in US dollars, a significant portion of our revenue is in foreign currencies and the majority of our international costs are denominated in\nlocal currencies. Over time, an increasing portion of our international contracts may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and failure to comply with these laws could subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments, or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, and other consequences. Any investigations, actions, or sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our platform must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nWe incorporate encryption technology into our platform. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our platform in those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our platform, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore,\nU.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Any violations of such economic embargoes and trade sanction regulations could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, and reputational harm.\nChanges in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs in expanding, protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property and our ability to expand our existing intellectual property portfolio. We primarily rely on copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or contractual agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we may not be able to secure our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and international markets in which we operate.\nSome or all of our issued patents may be invalidated or otherwise limited, allowing our competitors to develop competitive offerings. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention or that we can effectively use that patent to limit the ability of other companies to develop competitive products. We cannot be certain that we are the first to use the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications or otherwise used in our platform, that we are the first to file for protection in our patent applications, or that third parties do not have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our patented technology. While we have patents and patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our platform is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States (in particular, some foreign jurisdictions do not permit patent protection for software), and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States, including the America Invents Act, and by other national governments and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAlthough we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that have access to material confidential information and enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, these agreements may not be effective in controlling access to\nand distribution of our platform and propriety information or preventing reverse engineering. Further, these agreements may not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our platform.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property may have already occurred or may occur in the future. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights and could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which may be costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nThere has been considerable activity in our industry to develop intellectual property and enforce intellectual property rights. Our success depends upon our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our platform and underlying technology, and we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover aspects of our platform or the underlying technology. In the future, others may claim that our platform and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights.\nClaims of intellectual property rights infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights might require us to stop using technology found to violate a third party\u2019s rights, redesign our platform, which could require significant effort and expense and cause delays of releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our platform. With respect to such technology for which intellectual property rights are claimed to be infringed or otherwise violated by our technology or the conduct of our business, if we cannot or do not license any infringed or otherwise violated technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar non-infringing technology from another source, we could be forced to limit or stop selling our platform, we may not be able to meet our obligations to customers under our customer contracts, we may be unable to compete effectively, and our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers and business partners or to pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our platform, or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming, damage our reputation and brand, and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies, and we use third-party software development tools as we continue to develop and enhance our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party\nsoftware we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace such software. In addition, integration of the software used in our platform with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our functionality, and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties. In the event that we are not able to maintain our licenses to third-party software, or cannot obtain licenses to new software as needed, or in the event third-party software used in conjunction with our platform contains errors or defects, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur platform utilizes open source software, which could negatively affect our ability to offer our products and subject us to litigation or other adverse consequences.\nOur platform utilizes software governed by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, the MIT License and the Apache License. The use of open source software involves a number of risks, many of which cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. For example, the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses. We may face claims alleging noncompliance with open source license terms or misappropriation or other violation of open source technology. These claims could result in litigation, damage our reputation in the open-source community, or require us to purchase a costly license, devote additional research or development resources to re-engineer our products or services, discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, require us to make the source code of our proprietary code generally available, or result in us being enjoined from the offering of components of our platform that contained the open source software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. We also could be subject to lawsuits from other parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results or financial condition, and could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our platform. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software.\nIf the market for enterprise cloud software develops more slowly than we expect or declines our business could be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, nearly all of our revenue has come from sales of our subscription-based cloud software platform. We expect these sales to account for the substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud computing in general and of cloud-based business planning solutions in particular. The enterprise cloud software market is not as mature as the market for on-premises enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether enterprise cloud software will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to enterprise cloud software. It is difficult to predict customer adoption\nrates and demand for our platform, the future growth rate and size of the enterprise cloud software market, or the entry of competitive solutions. The expansion of the enterprise cloud software market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with enterprise cloud software, as well as the ability of enterprise cloud software companies to address security and privacy concerns. If other enterprise cloud software providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for enterprise cloud software as a whole, including our platform, may be negatively affected. If enterprise cloud software does not achieve widespread adoption, or if there is a reduction in demand for enterprise cloud software caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, or otherwise, our business could be adversely affected. Even if the enterprise cloud software market achieves widespread adoption in certain geographies, our business may be adversely affected if it does not achieve widespread adoption in other geographies.\nForecasts of market opportunity and market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and, even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nEstimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates of the size of the markets that we may be able to address and forecasts relating to the expected growth in the performance management and analytic applications software market are subject to many assumptions and may prove to be inaccurate. We may not be able to address fully the markets that we believe our platform may address, and these markets may not grow at the rates that we forecast. Even if our platform is able to address the markets that we believe represent our market opportunity and even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nOur corporate culture promotes visionary thinking, teamwork and creativity, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, it could harm our business.\nOur corporate culture promotes an entrepreneurial mindset that has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the core principles that have fueled our growth. We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. We hope to maintain our growth trajectory and will continue to hire aggressively as we expand, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, after the lock-up period in connection with our IPO expires at the end of the day on April 9, 2019, many of our existing employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our common stock in the public markets, which could lead to employee attrition that could adversely impact our culture and employee morale. Our aggressive focus on increasing our headcount and our transition from a private company to a public company may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nAs we expand our geographical footprint and increase our headcount we will need to maintain our corporate culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions. Any failure to maintain the cohesiveness our culture could negatively affect our business, reduce our ability to retain and recruit personnel and could lead to the failure to achieve our vision and implement our strategy.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We could also enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions for the same purpose. The pursuit of any of these strategic transactions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, we have limited experience in consummating strategic transactions. If we acquire additional businesses or enter into other strategic transactions, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the strategic transactions. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the strategic transactions due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ninability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nincurrence of transaction-related costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support, or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the strategic transaction.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nStrategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase our financial risk, and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, if a strategic transaction fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial position may suffer.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings and payments by customers. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund\nour ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, strategic transactions, a decline in the level of customer prepayments or unforeseen circumstances. We may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for these or other reasons, and we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential strategic transactions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nIf we default on our credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted and our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe have a credit facility that we may draw on to finance our operations, strategic transactions, and other corporate purposes. Our obligations pursuant to this credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on our assets for the benefit of the lenders. Our credit facility contains financial and operating covenants, including maintenance of specified financial ratios, customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, restrictions on certain intercompany transactions, and limitations on the amount of dividends and stock repurchases. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants or other obligations in the credit facility, or the occurrence of certain events specified in the credit facility, could result in a default under the credit facility and any future financial agreements into which we may enter. If we default on the obligations under our credit facility, our lenders may pursue various remedial actions against us, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring repayment of any outstanding amounts drawn on our credit facility;\n\u2022\nterminating our credit facility;\n\u2022\ndisposing of our assets subject to the lien; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to pay significant damages.\nIf any of these events occur, our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well as our business, could be seriously harmed. For more information on our credit facility, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nCatastrophic events and other events beyond our control may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, and our data centers are located in Santa Clara, California, Ashburn, Virginia, Frankfurt, Germany, and Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe incur increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased, and may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act, in fiscal 2020.\nPublic company reporting and disclosure obligations have caused our business and financial condition to become more visible. We believe that this increased visibility may result in threatened or actual litigation from time to time. If such claims are successful, our business, and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them and the diversion of management resources, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements, or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. During our most recent fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2019, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was identified relating to an error in the accounting for stock-based compensation expense with respect to certain of our restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted prior to our IPO. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The error was corrected through an immaterial correction relating specifically to stock-based compensation expense in the three and nine months ended October 31, 2018, as described in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We remediated this material weakness during the quarter ended January 31, 2019 by enhancing, and adding additional review controls over non-standard share-based payment awards. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended,\nand anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the applicable stock exchange. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we will be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act in fiscal 2020. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we will continue to take advantage, or intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of\nJuly 31, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or (iv) January 31, 2024.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire in fiscal 2029 and 2025 for federal and state purposes, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nFurthermore, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Reform Act, although the treatment of tax losses generated in taxable years ending before December 31, 2017, has generally not changed, tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. The reduced availability of net operating losses in future taxable years could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Such an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We do not believe that our IPO and concurrent private placement resulted in an ownership change, or if they did, we do not believe they will trigger any material limitation on the use of our tax attributes for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. However, the extent of such limitations for prior years, if any, has not yet been determined. Future changes in our stock ownership, however, could also cause an \u201cownership change.\u201d It is possible that an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nComprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe recently enacted Tax Reform Act includes significant changes in the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or \u201ctoll-charge\u201d on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. The primary impact of the new legislation on our provision for income taxes will be a reduction of the future tax benefits of existing temporary differences, which are primarily comprised of net operating loss carryforwards. Since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, we do not anticipate that these changes will have a material impact on our operating results, but we continue to examine the impact that this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition, including with respect to our non-U.S. operations, could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Reform Act and what effect that legal challenges will have on the Tax Reform Act.\nAdverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our customers, which could increase the costs of our services and adversely affect our business.\nThe application of federal, state, local, and international tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or\nordinances could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect) and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the Internet. These enactments could adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable or that we are not required to collect such taxes with respect to the jurisdiction. Sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. increasing states\u2019 ability to assert taxing jurisdiction on out-of-state retailers could result in certain additional jurisdictions asserting that sales and use and other taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could harm our future results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in federal, state, or international tax laws and accounting principles. In addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world, many of which have not established clear guidance on the tax treatment of SaaS-based companies. Any tax assessments, penalties, and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on us going forward will effectively increase the cost of our products to our customers and might adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for periods prior and subsequent to such change. For example, recent new standards issued by the FASB that could materially impact our financial statements include certain changes to accounting for leases. We may\nadopt one or more of these standards retrospectively to prior periods, and the adoption may result in an adverse change to previously reported results. Additionally, the adoption of these standards may potentially require enhancements or changes in our systems and could require our financial management to devote significant time and resources to implementing those changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in October 2018 at a price of $17.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $20.95 to $40.68, through March 20, 2019. In addition to factors discussed in this report, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance, including key metrics, and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our projected operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new software or enhancements to services, acquisitions, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our services due to computer hardware, software, or network problems;\n\u2022\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;\n\u2022\ntrading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of market standoff or contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources, and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nSubstantial blocks of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market when \u201clock-up\u201d or \u201cmarket standoff\u201d periods end. Substantial sales of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market, particularly by our directors, executive officers, or significant shareholders, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares All of the shares of common stock sold in our IPO are freely tradeable in the United States, except for any shares purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. Substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock prior to our IPO and shares issued in the concurrent private placement are currently restricted from resale as a result of market standoff and \u201clock-up\u201d agreements that have been entered into with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC in connection with our IPO. These shares will become available to be sold on April 10, 2019, 181 days after the date of the final prospectus used in connection with our IPO. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC may, in their discretion, permit our stockholders to sell shares prior to the expiration of the restrictive provisions contained in those lock-up agreements. Shares held by directors, executive officers, and other affiliates will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and various vesting agreements.\nCertain of our stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders, subject to market standoff and lock-up agreements.\nIn addition, we have filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and expiration of market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements referred to above, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding restricted stock units will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market. The issuance of these shares will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such issuance or conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts cease or reduce coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, and the holders of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately a majority of our common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding options and no settlement of outstanding restricted stock units. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our entire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This provision may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from engaging in a business combination with us even if the business combination would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential\nacquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for many types of disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 18141, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PLAN"}
