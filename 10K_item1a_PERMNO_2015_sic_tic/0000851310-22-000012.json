RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and harmed, and may continue to disrupt and harm, our business, financial condition and operating results. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such as travel bans and restrictions, social distancing requirements and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic and these related responses have caused, and may continue to cause, decreased demand for our offerings or delayed purchasing decisions by our customers, a global slowdown of economic activity (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), supply chain constraints, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below:\n\u2022Declines in demand for our offerings or delays in purchasing decisions as a result of the initial COVID-19 outbreak, which generally occurred in the first half of 2020 and may occur in the future, including as a result of social distancing requirements and shelter-in-place orders limiting our ability to deploy our products, and general economic uncertainty causing a number of businesses to delay or reduce costs;\n\u2022Supply chain disruptions and component shortages, exacerbated by overall increased demand for such components, and increased costs related to freight and shipping and securing timely and sufficient supply of certain product components;\n\u2022Delays in payments or defaults by our customers or if customers terminate their relationships with us or do not renew their agreements on economic or other terms that are favorable to us;\n\u2022Challenges in establishing certain new customer relationships due to travel and meeting restrictions as a result of COVID-19; and\n\u2022Our modified business practices in response to the pandemic, such as having most of our employees work remotely, canceling all non-essential employee travel, and cancelling, postponing or holding virtually events and meetings. We may in the future be required to, or choose voluntarily to, take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees; we have been and will continue to be flexible in allowing or limiting access to our various office locations based on local conditions. To the extent our current or future measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWhile we have seen improvements in our markets in recent periods, we remain cautious given recent COVID-19 surges across the globe and the impact the pandemic continues to have on global supply chains and the pricing and availability of certain materials and components. The severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses and its economic consequences continue to be uncertain, dynamic and difficult to predict, and the pandemic\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and on our business, operations and financial performance, depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: government, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport, prohibitions on, or voluntary cancellation of, large gatherings of people and social distancing requirements, and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response to local or regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of government funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility; volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the success of vaccination efforts and pace of recovery in the regions and countries where we conduct business, including the impact of any faltering or unsuccessful reopening of economic activity or subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19. As a result of the uncertainty and disrupted market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, operating results and financial condition has been and may continue to be adversely affected.\nWe depend on cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media industry spending for our revenue and any material decrease or delay in spending in any of these industries would negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur revenue has been derived from worldwide sales to service providers and broadcast and media companies, as well as, in recent years, streaming media companies. We expect that these markets will provide our revenue for the foreseeable future. Demand for our products and solutions will depend on the magnitude and timing of spending by customers in each of these markets for the purpose of creating, expanding or upgrading their systems. These spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022the impact of general economic conditions, actual and projected, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government and business responses thereto on the global economy and regional economies;\n\u2022access to financing;\n\u2022annual budget cycles of customers in each of the industries we serve;\n\u2022the impact of industry consolidation;\n\u2022customers suspending, reducing or shifting spending due to: (i) new video or cable industry standards; (ii) industry trends and technology shifts, such as virtualization and cloud-based solutions, and (iii) new products and solutions, such as products and services based on our VOS software platform or our CableOS software-based cable access solutions;\n\u2022delayed or reduced near-term spending as customers transition away from video appliance solutions and adopt new business and operating models enabled by software- and cloud-based solutions, including SaaS unified video processing solutions;\n\u2022federal, state, local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications, television broadcasting and streaming media;\n\u2022overall demand for communication services and consumer acceptance of new video and data technologies and services;\n\u2022competitive pressures, including pricing pressures;\n\u2022the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022discretionary end-user customer spending patterns.\nIn the past, specific factors contributing to reduced spending have included:\n\u2022uncertainty and deteriorated market conditions regionally and globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022weak or uncertain economic and financial conditions in the United States or one or more international markets;\n\u2022uncertainty related to development of industry technology;\n\u2022delays in evaluations of new services, new standards and systems architectures by certain customers;\n\u2022emphasis by certain of our customers on generating revenue from existing subscribers or end-customers, rather than from new subscribers or end-customers, through construction, expansion or upgrades;\n\u2022a reduction in the amount of capital available to finance projects of our customers and potential customers;\n\u2022proposed and completed business combinations and divestitures by our customers and the length of regulatory review of each;\n\u2022completion of a new system or significant expansion or upgrade to a system; and\n\u2022bankruptcies and financial restructuring of major customers.\nIn the past, adverse economic conditions in one or more of the geographies in which we offer our products have adversely affected our customers\u2019 spending in those geographies and, as a result, our business. During challenging economic times, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and in tight credit markets, many customers have delayed and reduced and may continue to delay or reduce capital expenditures. This has resulted and could continue to result in reductions in revenue from our products, longer sales cycles, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the United States, Europe or other key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate, we could experience a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, since most of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, global economic and market conditions may impact currency exchange rates and cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region, which could lead to delayed or reduced spending in those countries or regions, thereby negatively impacting our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, industry consolidation has in the past constrained, and may in the future constrain or delay, spending by our customers. Further, if our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the spending of customers in the markets on which we focus, our revenue may decline.\nAs a result of these various factors and potential issues related to customer spending, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue in the future, and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers, a failure to continue diversifying our customer base, or a decrease in the number of larger transactions could harm our business and our operating results.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from relatively few customers, due in part to the consolidation of media customers. Sales to our top 10 customers in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 accounted for approximately 58%, 51% and 49% of revenue, respectively. Although we continue to seek to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets and further expanding internationally, we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration.\nIn the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Comcast accounted for 26%, 20% and 23% of our net revenue, respectively. Further consolidation in the cable industry could lead to additional revenue concentration for us. The loss of any significant customer, or any material reduction in orders from any other significant customer, or our failure to qualify our new products with any significant customer could materially and adversely affect, either long term or in a particular quarter, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Further, while Comcast\u2019s election to license our CableOS software contains commitments in license fees to us, if Comcast deploys our solutions more slowly or at a scale that is lower than we anticipate, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely effected.\nIn addition, we are involved in most quarters in one or more relatively large individual transactions. A decrease in the number of the relatively larger individual transactions in which we are involved in any quarter could materially and adversely affect our operating results for that quarter.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to increase our revenues from some or all of the markets we address, or to do so profitably, and any failure to increase revenues and profits from these customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and solutions in a timely manner to meet the needs of our customers and to remain competitive.\nAll of the markets we address are characterized by continuing technological advancement, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. To compete successfully, we must continually design, develop, manufacture and sell new or enhanced products and solutions that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability and meet our customers\u2019 changing needs. However, we may not be successful in those efforts if, among other things, our products and solutions:\n\u2022 are not cost effective;\n\u2022 are not brought to market in a timely manner;\n\u2022 are not in accordance with evolving industry standards;\n\u2022 fail to meet market acceptance or customer requirements; or\n\u2022 are ahead of the needs of their markets.\nIf new standards or some of our new products are adopted later than we predict or not adopted at all, or if adoption occurs earlier than we are able to deliver the applicable products or functionality, we risk spending significant research and development time and dollars on products or features that may never achieve market acceptance or that miss the customer demand window and thus do not produce the revenue that a timely introduction would have likely produced.\nIf we fail to develop and market new and enhanced products and solutions on a timely basis, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive.\nThe markets for our products are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change and declining average sales prices in the past.\nOur competitors in our Video appliance business include ATEME, MediaKind, Synamedia, Grass Valley, Evertz Microsystems, CommScope and Imagine Communications. Our competitors in our Video SaaS business include Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Kaltura, iStreamPlanet, Brightcove and Edgecast. Our competitors in our Cable Access business include CommScope, Casa Systems and Cisco Systems, Vecima Networks and Calix.\nA number of our principal business competitors in both of our business segments are substantially larger and/or may have access to greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources than we have. Consolidation in the Video industry has led to the acquisition of a number of our historic competitors over the last several years by private equity firms and by AWS. With respect to our Cable Access business, our competitors are generally substantially larger than us.\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors may have more long-standing and established relationships with certain domestic and foreign customers. Many of these large enterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in spending by customers in our markets and may be better able to navigate periods of market uncertainty, such as the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. They often have broader product lines and market focus, and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their products together to meet the needs of a particular customer, and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide. To the extent large enterprises that currently do not compete directly with us choose to enter our markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition would likely intensify.\nFurther, some of our competitors have offered, and in the future may offer, their products at lower prices than we offer for our competing products or on more attractive financing or payment terms, which has in the past caused, and may in the future cause, us to lose sales opportunities and the resulting revenue or to reduce our prices in response to that competition. Also, some competitors that are smaller than we are have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, aggressive price competition in order to gain customer traction and market share. Reductions in prices for any of our products could materially and adversely affect our operating margins and revenue.\nAdditionally, certain customers and potential customers have developed, and may continue to develop, their own solutions that may cause such customers or potential customers to not consider our product offerings or to displace our installed products with their own solutions. The growing availability of open source codecs and related software, as well as new server chipsets that incorporate encoding technology, has, in certain respects, lowered the barriers to entry for the video processing industry. The development of solutions by potential and existing customers and the reduction of the barriers to entry to enter the video processing industry could result in increased competition and adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nIf any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies were to become the industry standard, our business could be seriously harmed. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products to market earlier than us, or if these products are more technologically capable than ours, our revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future growth depends on a number of video and broadband industry trends.\nTechnology, industry and regulatory trends and requirements may affect the growth of our business. These trends and requirements include the following:\n\u2022convergence, whereby network operators bundle video, voice and data services to consumers, including mobile delivery options;\n\u2022continued strong consumer demand for streaming video services;\n\u2022continued adoption of public cloud SaaS platforms to stream video content to consumers, as well as for broadcast infrastructure workflows;\n\u2022continued growth in targeted advertising as a key revenue source for video streaming service providers;\n\u2022the pace of adoption and deployment of high-bandwidth technology, such as DOCSIS 3.x, DOCSIS 4.0, next generation LTE and fiber-to-the-premises (\u201cFTTP\u201d);\n\u2022the use of digital video by businesses, governments and educational institutions globally;\n\u2022efforts by regulators and governments in the United States and internationally to encourage the adoption of broadband and digital technologies, including 5G broadband networks, as well as to regulate broadband access and delivery;\n\u2022the need to develop partnerships with other companies involved in video infrastructure workflow and broadband services;\n\u2022the extent and nature of regulatory attitudes towards issues such as network neutrality, competition between operators, access by third parties to networks of other operators, local franchising requirements for telcos to offer video, and other new services, such as mobile video; and\n\u2022the outcome of disputes and negotiations between content owners and service providers regarding rights of service providers to store and distribute recorded broadcast content, which outcomes may drive adoption of one technology over another in some cases.\nIf we fail to recognize and respond to these trends, by timely developing products, features and services required by these trends, we are likely to lose revenue opportunities and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur software-based cable access product initiatives expose us to certain technology transition risks that may adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe believe our CableOS software-based cable access solutions, supporting centralized, DAA or hybrid configurations, will significantly reduce cable headend costs and increase operational efficiency, and are an important step in cable operators\u2019 transition to all-IP networks. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to innovate and develop and deploy our cable access solutions in a timely manner, or are otherwise delayed in making our solutions available to our customers, our business may be adversely impacted, particularly if our competitors develop and market similar or superior products and solutions.\nWe believe our software-based cable access solutions will continue to replace and make obsolete current CMTS solutions, which is a market our products have historically not addressed, as well as cable edge-QAM products. If demand for our software-based cable access solutions is weaker than expected, our near and long-term operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Moreover, if competitors adapt new cable industry technology standards into competing cable access solutions faster than we do, or promulgate a new or competitive architecture for next-generation cable access solutions that renders our CableOS solution obsolete, our business may be adversely impacted.\nThe sales cycle for our CableOS solutions tends to be long. For cable operators, upgrading or expanding network infrastructure is complex and expensive, and investing in a CableOS solution is a significant strategic decision that may require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify. Potential customers need to ensure our CableOS solution will interoperate with the various components of its existing network infrastructure, including third-party equipment, servers and software. In addition, since we are a relatively new entrant into the CMTS market, we need to demonstrate significant performance, functionality and/or cost advantages with our CableOS solutions that outweigh customer switching costs. If sales cycles are significantly longer than anticipated or we are otherwise unsuccessful in growing our CableOS sales, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and, as a result, may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, causing our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future, on an annual and a quarterly basis, as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n\u2022the level and timing of spending of our customers in the United States, Europe and in other markets;\n\u2022economic and financial conditions specific to each of the cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media industries, as well as general economic and financial market conditions, including the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and government and business responses thereto as well as related supply chain and labor shortage issues;\n\u2022changes in market acceptance of and demand for our products or our customers\u2019 services or products;\n\u2022the timing and amount of orders, especially from large individual transactions and transactions with our significant customers;\n\u2022the mix of our products sold and the effect it has on gross margins;\n\u2022the timing of revenue recognition, including revenue recognition on sales arrangements and from transactions with significant service and support components, which may span several quarters;\n\u2022our transition to a SaaS subscription model for our Video business, which may cause near-term declines in revenue;\n\u2022the timing of completion of our customers\u2019 projects;\n\u2022the length of each customer product upgrade cycle and the volume of purchases during the cycle;\n\u2022competitive market conditions, including pricing actions by our competitors;\n\u2022the level and mix of our domestic and international revenue;\n\u2022new product introductions by our competitors or by us;\n\u2022uncertainty in both the U.K. and the European Union due to the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union and the impact of the U.K.\u2019s transitional period following this exit, which could adversely affect our results, financial condition and prospects;\n\u2022changes in domestic and international regulatory environments affecting our business;\n\u2022the evaluation of new services, new standards and system architectures by our customers;\n\u2022the cost and timely availability to us of components, subassemblies and modules;\n\u2022the mix of our customer base, by industry and size, and sales channels;\n\u2022changes in our operating and extraordinary expenses;\n\u2022the timing of acquisitions and dispositions by us and the financial impact of such transactions;\n\u2022impairment of our goodwill and intangibles;\n\u2022the impact of litigation, such as related litigation expenses and settlement costs;\n\u2022write-downs of inventory and investments;\n\u2022changes in our effective federal tax rate, including as a result of changes in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, and changes in our effective state tax rates, including as a result of apportionment;\n\u2022changes to tax rules related to the deferral of foreign earnings and compliance with foreign tax rules;\n\u2022the impact of applicable accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes that requires us to establish reserves for uncertain tax positions and accrue potential tax penalties and interest; and\n\u2022the impact of applicable accounting guidance on business combinations that requires us to record charges for certain acquisition related costs and expenses and generally to expense restructuring costs associated with a business combination subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe timing of deployment of our products by our customers can be subject to a number of other risks, including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel, the availability of third-party equipment and services, our customers\u2019 ability to negotiate and enter into rights agreements with video content owners that provide our customers with the right to deliver certain video content, and our customers\u2019 need for local franchise and licensing approvals.\nWe often recognize a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter. We establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected revenue levels for a specified period, and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. Accordingly, even small variations in the timing of revenue, particularly from relatively large individual transactions, can cause significant fluctuations in operating results in a particular quarter.\nAs a result of these factors and other factors, our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nWe purchase several key components, subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources, and we rely on contract manufacturers and other subcontractors.\nOur reliance on sole or limited suppliers, particularly foreign suppliers, and our reliance on contractors for manufacturing and installation of our products, involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, subassemblies or modules; reduced control over costs, quality and timely delivery of components, subassemblies or modules; supplier discontinuation of components, subassemblies or modules we require; and timely installation of products. In addition, our financial results may be impacted by tariffs imposed by the United States on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods. If any such tariffs are imposed on products or components that we import, including those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we could experience reduced revenues or may have to raise our prices, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThese risks could be heightened during a substantial economic slowdown because our suppliers and subcontractors are more likely to experience adverse changes in their financial condition and operations during such a period. Further, these risks could materially and adversely affect our business if one of our sole sources, or a sole source of one of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, is adversely affected by a natural disaster or the outbreak of disease, epidemics and other pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our supply chain. While we expend resources to qualify additional component sources, consolidation of suppliers and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts. Managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult during time periods in which we introduce new products and during time periods in which demand for our products is increasing, especially if demand increases more quickly than we expect.\nPlexus Services Corp. (\u201cPlexus\u201d), which manufactures our products at its facilities in Malaysia, currently serves as our primary contract manufacturer, and currently accounts for a majority, by dollar amount, of the products that we purchase from our contract manufacturers. Most of the products manufactured by our French and Israeli operations are outsourced to another third-party manufacturer in France and Israel, respectively. From time to time we assess our relationship with our contract manufacturers, and we do not generally maintain long-term agreements with any of our suppliers or contract manufacturers. Our agreement with Plexus has automatic annual renewals, unless prior notice is given by either party, and has been automatically renewed for a term expiring in October 2022.\nDifficulties in managing relationships with any of our current contract manufacturers, particularly Plexus, that manufacture our products off-shore, or any of our suppliers of key components, subassemblies and modules used in our products, could impede our ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements and adversely affect our operating results. An inability to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our products or any materials used in our products, or the inability of any of our contract manufacturers to scale their production to meet demand, such as the inability of certain of our contract manufacturers to operate at capacity for periods of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may occur again in future periods, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, had negatively impacted and could continue to negatively affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business and materially and adversely affect our revenue and other operating results. Furthermore, if we fail to meet customers\u2019 supply expectations, our revenue would be adversely affected and we may lose sales opportunities, both short and long term, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Increases, from time to time, in demand on our suppliers and subcontractors from our customers or from other parties have, on occasion, caused delays in the availability of certain components and products. In response, we may increase our inventories of certain components and products and expedite shipments of our products when necessary. These actions could increase our costs and could also increase our risk of holding obsolete or excess inventory, which, despite our use of a demand order fulfillment model, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nWe rely on resellers, value-added resellers and systems integrators for a significant portion of our revenue, and disruptions to, or our failure to develop and manage our relationships with these customers or the processes and procedures that support them could adversely affect our business.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our revenue through sales to resellers, value-added resellers (\u201cVARs\u201d) and systems integrators that assist us with fulfillment or installation obligations. We expect that these sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of our revenue in the future. Accordingly, our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of channel partners.\nWe generally have no long-term contracts or minimum purchase commitments with any of our reseller, VAR or system integrator customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Our competitors may provide incentives to any of our reseller, VAR or systems integrator customers to favor their products or, in effect, to prevent or reduce sales of our products. Any of our reseller, VAR or systems integrator customers may independently choose not to purchase or offer our products. Many of our resellers, and some of our VARs and system integrators are small, are based in a variety of international locations, and may have relatively unsophisticated processes and limited financial resources to conduct their business. Any significant disruption of our sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their business with respect to the purchase of, and payment for, our products, or their ability to comply with our policies and procedures as well as applicable laws, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our failure to continue to establish or maintain successful relationships with reseller, VAR and systems integrator customers could likewise materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face risks associated with having outsourced engineering resources located in Ukraine.\nWe outsource a portion of our research and development and product support activities to our third-party partner, GlobalLogic, a Hitachi group company. Through GlobalLogic, we have a significant number of engineering resources located in Kyiv, Ukraine that are dedicated to our Cable Access and Video business segments. Political, social and economic instability and unrest or violence in Ukraine from the ongoing military conflict with the Russian Federation have caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to the business and operations of GlobalLogic, which could slow or delay the development and support work our outsourced engineering teams are undertaking for us. Any escalation of political tensions, military activity, instability, unrest or conflict could limit or prevent our employees from traveling to, from, or within Ukraine to direct and coordinate our outsourced engineering teams, or cause us to shift all or portions of the development and support work occurring in Ukraine, and/or cause GlobalLogic to relocate personnel to other locations or countries pursuant to its business continuity plans. Any resulting delays could negatively impact our product development and support efforts, operating results and our business.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 890 employees in our international operations, representing approximately 70% of our worldwide workforce. In recent years, we have expanded our international operations significantly. For example, upon the closing of our acquisition of Thomson Video Networks (\u201cTVN\u201d) on February 29, 2016, we added 438 employees, most of whom were based in France. Our ability to manage our business effectively in the future, including with respect to any future growth, our operation as both a hardware and increasingly software- and SaaS-centric business, the integration of any acquisition efforts such as our acquisition of TVN, and the breadth of our international operations, will require us to train, motivate and manage our employees successfully, to attract and integrate new employees into our overall operations, to retain key employees and to continue to improve and evolve our operational, financial and management systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant majority of our employees working mostly or completely from home, which has required us to allocate additional resources towards IT and operations, and which may create new challenges for our operational and management systems. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these efforts, and our failure to effectively manage our operations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with having facilities and employees located in Israel.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we maintained facilities in Israel with a total of 226 employees, or approximately 18% of our worldwide workforce. Our employees in Israel engage in a number of activities, for both our Video and Cable Access business segments, including research and development, product development, product management, supply chain management for certain product lines and sales activities.\nAs such, we are directly affected by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Any significant conflict involving Israel could have a direct effect on our business or that of our Israeli contract manufacturers, in the form of physical damage or injury, restrictions from traveling or reluctance to travel to from or within Israel by our Israeli and other employees or those of our subcontractors, or the loss of Israeli employees to active military duty. Most of our employees in Israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces, and approximately 8% of those employees were called for active military duty in 2021. In the event that more of our employees are called to active duty, certain of our research and development activities may be significantly delayed and adversely affected. Further, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, as a result of terrorist attacks or hostilities, conflicts between Israel and any other Middle Eastern country or organization, or any other cause, could significantly harm our business. Additionally, current or future tensions or conflicts in the Middle East could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn order to manage our growth, we must be successful in addressing management succession issues and attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur future success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our management to operate effectively, both individually and as a group. We must successfully manage transition and replacement issues that may result from the departure or retirement of members of our executive management. We cannot provide assurances that changes of management personnel in the future would not cause disruption to operations or customer relationships or a decline in our operating results.\nWe are also dependent on our ability to retain and motivate our existing highly qualified personnel, in addition to attracting new highly qualified personnel. Competition for qualified management, technical and other personnel is often intense, particularly in Silicon Valley, Israel and Hong Kong where we have significant research and development activities, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Competitors and others have in the past attempted, and are likely in the future to attempt, to recruit our employees. While our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality, non-solicitation and ownership of inventions, we generally do not have non-competition agreements with our personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring such personnel, particularly senior management and engineers and other technical personnel, could negatively affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, a certain portion of our personnel in the United States is comprised of foreign nationals whose ability to work for us depends on obtaining the necessary visas. Our ability to hire and retain foreign nationals in the United States, and their ability to remain and work in the United States, is affected by various laws and regulations, including limitations on the availability of visas. Changes in United States laws or regulations affecting the availability of visas have, and may continue to adversely affect, our ability to hire or retain key personnel and as a result may impair our operations.\nOur products include third-party technology and intellectual property, and our inability to acquire new technologies or use third-party technology in the future could harm our business.\nIn order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products, we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties. Although companies with technology useful to us are often willing to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with respect to such technology, we cannot provide assurances that such agreements may be negotiated on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The failure to enter, or a delay in entering, into such technology development or licensing agreements, when necessary or desirable, could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our products, and, as noted, intend to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. In addition, the technologies that we license may not operate properly or as specified, and we may not be able to secure alternatives in a timely manner, either of which could harm our business. We could face delays in product releases until alternative technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our products, if we are able to do so at all. These delays, or a failure to secure or develop adequate technology, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nCybersecurity incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by disrupting our business operations, compromising our products and services, damaging our reputation or exposing us to liability.\nCyber criminals and hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security, misappropriate our proprietary information or cause business interruptions. Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In the past, we have faced compromises to our network security, and companies are facing additional attacks as workforces become more distributed following shelter-in-place orders. While we have invested in and continue to update our network security and cybersecurity infrastructure and systems, if our cybersecurity systems fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyber-attacks, phishing schemes, ransomware, data protection breaches, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022our intellectual property and other proprietary data, or financial assets, could be stolen;\n\u2022our ability to manage and conduct our business operations could be seriously disrupted;\n\u2022defects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our product, software and SaaS offerings, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products; and\n\u2022personally identifiable data of our customers, employees and business partners could be compromised.\nShould any of the above events occur, our reputation, competitive position and business could be significantly harmed, and we could be subject to claims for liability from customers, third parties and governmental authorities. Additionally, we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our business operations utilize and rely upon numerous third-party vendors, manufacturers, solution providers, partners and consultants, and any failure of such third parties\u2019 cybersecurity measures could materially and adversely affect or disrupt our business.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by natural disasters affecting us or impacting our third-party manufacturers, suppliers, resellers or customers.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in California, which is prone to earthquakes. In addition, climate change is contributing to an increase in erratic weather patterns globally and intensifying the impact of certain types of catastrophes, such as floods and wildfires. We have employees, consultants and contractors located in regions and countries around the world. In the event that any of our business, sales or research and development centers or offices in the United States or internationally are adversely affected by an earthquake, flood, wildfire or by any other natural disaster, we may sustain damage to our operations and properties, which could cause a sustained interruption or loss of affected operations, and cause us to suffer significant financial losses.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers for the production of our products. Any significant disruption in the business or operations of such manufacturers or of their or our suppliers could adversely impact our business. Our principal contract manufacturers and several of their and our suppliers and our resellers have operations in locations that are subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather, tsunamis, floods, fires and earthquakes, which could disrupt their operations and, in turn, our operations.\nIn addition, if there is a natural disaster in any of the locations in which our significant customers are located, we face the risk that our customers may incur losses or sustained business interruption, or both, which may materially impair their ability to continue their purchase of products from us. Accordingly, natural disaster in one of the geographies in which we, or our third-party manufacturers, their or our suppliers or our customers, operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nFinancial, Transactional and Tax Risks\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds at all or on terms acceptable to us.\nWe engage in the design, development and manufacture and sale of a variety of video and cable access products and system solutions, which has required, and will continue to require, significant research and development expenditures.\nWe are monitoring and managing our cash position in light of ongoing market conditions due to COVID-19. We believe that our existing cash of approximately $133.4 million at December 31, 2021 will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional funds to take advantage of presently unanticipated strategic opportunities, satisfy our other cash requirements from time to time, or strengthen our financial position. Our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including factors beyond our control, such as weakness in the economic conditions in markets in which we sell our products and continued uncertainty in financial, capital and credit markets. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when and if it is needed.\nWe may raise additional financing through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, debt financings, or corporate partnership or licensing arrangements. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, our stockholders may experience dilution, and any new equity or convertible debt securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to holders of our common stock. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. To the extent we raise capital through debt financing arrangements, we may be required to pledge assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness and the interest on such debt may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf adequate capital is not available, or is not available on reasonable terms, when needed, we may not be able to take advantage of acquisition or other market opportunities, to timely develop new products, or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes (together, the \u201cNotes\u201d), or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the Notes or in connection with any repurchase of Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the applicable maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as set forth in the applicable indenture governing the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, including the Notes.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes of the applicable series or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes or at their respective maturity may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase such Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture governing the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of such Notes or at their respective maturity as required by the applicable indenture governing the Notes would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under such indenture, or the fundamental change itself, could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. Moreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the applicable indenture governing the Notes could constitute an event of default under any such agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase such series of Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of each indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our debt (including the Notes) when due. In addition, the Credit Agreement we entered into with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender, and Harmonic International GmbH, as co-borrower, on December 19, 2019 and amended in 2020, permits us to incur certain additional indebtedness and grant certain liens on our assets that could intensify the risks discussed above.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled under the respective indenture governing such Notes to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company made an irrevocable election under the terms of the indentures governing each series of the Notes to settle the principal portion of such Notes solely with cash and may pay or deliver, as the case may be, any conversion value greater than the principal amount in cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company\u2019s election. Accordingly, if one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we would be required to settle the principal portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their series of Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such series of Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for each series of the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date, and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of each series of Notes. This requires us to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of each series of Notes to their face amount over the respective terms of the Notes. We report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our future financial results or the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts on an entity\u2019s own equity. Among other changes, ASU No. 2020-06 removes from United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the life of the instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and can be adopted either on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\nThe Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2022 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption is expected to reduce additional paid-in capital and convertible debt (mezzanine equity) by approximately $32.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of outstanding convertible debt, which was initially separated and recorded in stockholder\u2019s equity, and to remove the remaining debt discount of approximately $15.2 million related to this previous separation. The net effect of these adjustments will be recorded as a reduction in the balance of the opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2022.\nThe Company currently expects the adoption of this ASU will result in the reduction of non-cash interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2022 and future periods until the settlement of the remaining outstanding Notes. The required use of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible notes on diluted earnings per share is not expected to have a material impact. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company and the trustee for 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes entered into supplemental indentures for both 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes. Pursuant to the supplemental indentures, the Company eliminated its option to settle the principal of the Notes in shares of the Company's common stock upon conversion. Accordingly, the dilutive effect of the Company's 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes will be limited to the conversion premium. The adoption of this ASU will have no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions, and any acquisition could disrupt our operations, cause dilution to our stockholders and materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we have acquired, and we may continue to acquire, businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that we believe complement or expand our existing business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022unanticipated costs or delays associated with an acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties in the assimilation and integration of acquired operations, technologies and/or products;\n\u2022potential disruption of our business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the regular operations of the business during the acquisition process;\n\u2022the challenges of managing a larger and more geographically widespread operation and product portfolio after the closing of the acquisition;\n\u2022potential adverse effects on new and existing business relationships with suppliers, contract manufacturers, resellers, partners and customers;\n\u2022compliance with regulatory requirements, such as local employment regulations and organized labor in France;\n\u2022risks associated with entering markets in which we may have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses and our own business as a result of integration;\n\u2022difficulties in bringing acquired products and businesses into compliance with applicable legal requirements in jurisdictions in which we operate and sell products;\n\u2022impact of known potential liabilities or unknown liabilities, including litigation and infringement claims, associated with companies we acquire;\n\u2022substantial charges for acquisition costs or for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items;\n\u2022substantial impairments to goodwill or intangible assets in the event that an acquisition proves to be less valuable than the price we paid for it;\n\u2022difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform financial and other standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022delays in realizing, or failure to realize, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition; and\n\u2022the possibility that any acquisition may be viewed negatively by our customers or investors or the financial markets.\nCompetition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets and product lines has been, and is likely to continue to be, intense. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition that we would like to consummate, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms or because the target chooses to be acquired by another company. Furthermore, in the event that we are able to identify and consummate any future acquisitions, we may, in each of those acquisitions:\n\u2022issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022incur substantial debt to finance the acquisition or assume substantial debt in the acquisition;\n\u2022incur significant acquisition-related expenses;\n\u2022assume substantial liabilities, contingent or otherwise; or\n\u2022expend significant cash.\nThese financing activities or expenditures could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and financial condition or the price of our common stock. Alternatively, due to difficulties in the capital or credit markets at the time, we may be unable to secure capital necessary to complete an acquisition on reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, even if we were to obtain benefits from acquisitions in the form of increased revenue and earnings per share, there may be a delay between the time the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time we recognize such benefits.\nIn addition to the risks outlined above, if we are unable to successfully receive payment of any significant portion of our existing French R&D credit receivables from the French authority as expected, or are unable to successfully apply for or otherwise obtain the financial benefit of new French R&D credits in future years, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as well as our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $240.2 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet associated with prior acquisitions. In the event we determine that our goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down all or a portion of such goodwill, which could result in a material non-cash charge to our results of operations in the period in which such write-down occurs.\nIf we are unable to successfully address one or more of these risks, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may sell one or more of our product lines, from time to time, as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets, and any such divestiture could adversely affect our continuing business and our expenses, revenues, results of operation, cash flows and financial position.\nWe periodically evaluate our various product lines and may, as a result, consider the divestiture of one or more of those product lines. We have sold product lines in the past, and any prior or future divestiture could adversely affect our continuing business and expenses, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDivestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line, the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur, delays in closing any sale, the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business, unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from the seller\u2019s information technology and other operating systems, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification or breach of transition services obligations of the seller. Expected cost savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to the seller\u2019s fixed cost structure, and a seller may experience varying success in reducing fixed costs or transferring liabilities previously associated with the divested business.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting generally accepted accounting principles is uncertain. Significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward and changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our operating results.\nU.S. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. We are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business. Changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under U.S. GAAP that have a significant effect on our reported financial results and require us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply with the updated standards or interpretations.\nIn addition, we have in the past and may in the future need to modify our customer contracts, accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles. The cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition.\nFluctuations in our future effective tax rates could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are required to periodically review our deferred tax assets and determine whether, based on available evidence, a valuation allowance is necessary. The realization of our deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent upon the generation of sufficient U.S. and foreign taxable income in the future to offset these assets. Based on our evaluation, we recorded a net increase in valuation allowance of $0.3 million and $6.7 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, against the net deferred tax assets. The increases in valuation allowance in 2021 and 2020 were offset by the valuation allowance release of $9.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to deferred taxes for certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company reduced its valuation allowance in 2021 based on continued improved operating results over the past few years and expectations about generating foreign taxable income in the future. Changes in the amount of the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions valuation allowance could result in a material non-cash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. In the event we determine that it is appropriate to create a reserve or increase an existing reserve for any such potential liabilities, the amount of the additional reserve will be charged as an expense in the period in which it is determined. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment for the applicable period, a further charge to expense in the period such shortfall is determined would result. Either such charge to expense could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results for the applicable period.\nOur future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge our international tax structure or if the relative mix of U.S. and international income changes for any reason. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our effective income tax rate will be less than the U.S. federal statutory rate in future periods.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe or our customers may face intellectual property infringement claims from third parties.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the telecommunications industry have extensive patent portfolios. Also, patent infringement claims and litigation by entities that purchase or control patents, but do not produce goods or services covered by the claims of such patents (so-called \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d or \u201cNPEs\u201d), have increased rapidly over the last decade or so. From time to time, third parties, including NPEs, have asserted, and may assert in the future, patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers, and have initiated audits to determine whether we have missed royalty payments for technology that we license. Our suppliers and their customers, including us, may have similar claims asserted against them. A number of third parties, including companies with greater financial and other resources than us, have asserted patent rights to technologies that are important to us.\nAny intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial expense and significant diversion of the efforts of our management and technical personnel. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities and temporary or permanent injunctions and require us to seek licenses from third parties or pay royalties that may be substantial. Furthermore, necessary licenses may not be available on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. An unfavorable outcome on any such litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments, or could prohibit us from selling certain of our products. Any such outcome could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur suppliers and customers may have intellectual property claims relating to our products asserted against them. We have agreed to indemnify some of our suppliers and most of our customers for patent infringement relating to our products. The scope of this indemnity varies, but, in some instances, includes indemnification for damages and expenses (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) incurred by the supplier or customer in connection with such claims. If a supplier or a customer seeks to enforce a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs defending such claim, the underlying claim or both. An adverse determination in either such proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may be the subject of litigation which, if adversely determined, could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to claims arising in the normal course of business. The costs of defending any litigation, whether in cash expenses or in management time, could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. An unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant settlement costs. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights and data may adversely affect us.\nAt December 31, 2021, we held 110 issued U.S. patents and 46 issued foreign patents, and had 49 patent applications pending. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing arrangements, maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures, we can give no assurances that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. We can give no assurances that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies or design around the patents that we own. In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future.\nWe may enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and vendors and our customers, as needed, and generally limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurances that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, we have taken in the past, and may take in the future, legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and other resources, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur use of open source software in some of our products may expose us to certain risks.\nSome of our products contain software modules licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and in less time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source closely, it is possible our past, present or future use of open source has triggered or may trigger the foregoing requirements. Furthermore, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to import and export control and trade and economic sanction laws and regulations that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export control laws, and may be exported outside the U.S. only with the required export license or through an export license exception, in most cases because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. We are also subject to U.S. trade and economic sanction regulations which include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to the United States embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products, or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products, in those countries. Although we take precautions and have processes in place to prevent our products and services from being provided in violation of such laws, our products may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. In March 2020, we received an administrative subpoena from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) requesting information about transactions involving Iran. The transactions were by the French company TVN, which we acquired in early 2016. Pursuant to regulations that remained in place until 2018, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies were allowed to engage in transactions with Iran if certain requirements were met. Harmonic is fully cooperating in the OFAC investigation. If we are found to have violated U.S. export control laws as a result of the pending OFAC investigation or future investigations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws. While we do not anticipate the impact of the OFAC investigation to be material on our business, our business and operating results could be adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise.\nIn addition, we may be subject to customs duties that could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results or, if we are able to pass on the related costs in any particular situation, would increase the cost of the related product to our customers. As a result, the future imposition of significant increases in the level of customs duties or the creation of import quotas on our products in Europe or in other jurisdictions, or any of the limitations on international sales described above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Further, some of our customers in Europe have been, or are being, audited by local governmental authorities regarding the tariff classifications used for importation of our products. Import duties and tariffs vary by country and a different tariff classification for any of our products may result in higher duties or tariffs, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and potentially increase the cost of the related products to our customers.\nOur business and industry are subject to various laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business and industry are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws. For example, we are subject to environmental regulations such as the European Union\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) and Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cRoHS\u201d) directives and similar legislation enacted in other jurisdictions worldwide. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in such regions and countries. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they would likely result in additional costs, and could require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which, among other things, requires an annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. If we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation as of future year-ends, we may incur substantial additional costs in an effort to correct such problems, and investors may lose confidence in our financial statements, and our stock price may decrease in the short term, until we correct such problems, and perhaps in the long term, as well.\nWe are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to conduct research, disclose, and report whether or not our products contain certain conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or its surrounding countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we may incur certain additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free and/or we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\nChanges in telecommunications legislation and regulations in the United States and other countries could affect our sales and the revenue we are able to derive from our products. In particular, on December 14, 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) voted to repeal the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules and return to a \u201clight-touch\u201d regulatory framework. The FCC\u2019s new rules, which took effect in June 2018, granted providers of broadband internet access services greater freedom to make changes to their services, including, potentially, changes that may discriminate against or otherwise harm our business. However, a number of parties have appealed these rules, which appeals are currently being reviewed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; thus the future impact of the FCC's repeal and any changes thereto remains uncertain. Additionally, on September 30, 2018, California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018. Since the FCC repealed its nationwide regulations, seven states have also enacted a state-level net neutrality law and a number of other states are considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. We cannot predict whether the FCC order or state initiatives will be modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. The repeal of the net neutrality rules or other regulations dealing with access by competitors to the networks of incumbent operators could slow or stop infrastructure and services investments or expansion by service providers. Increased regulation of our customers\u2019 pricing or service offerings could limit their investments and, consequently, revenue from our products. The impact of new or revised legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe depend significantly on our international revenue and are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including those of our resellers, contract manufacturers and outsourcing partners, which may negatively affect our operating results.\nRevenue derived from customers outside of the United States in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 represented approximately 44%, 49% and 50% of our revenue, respectively. Although no assurance can be given with respect to international sales growth in any one or more regions, we expect that international revenue will likely continue to represent, from year to year, a majority, and potentially increasing, percentage of our annual revenue for the foreseeable future. A significant percentage of our revenue is generated from sales to resellers, VARs and systems integrators, particularly in emerging market countries. Furthermore, the majority of our employees are based in our international offices and locations, and most of our contract manufacturing occurs outside of the United States. In addition, we outsource a portion of our research and development activities to certain third-party partners with development centers located in different countries, particularly Ukraine and India.\nOur international operations, international operations of our resellers, contract manufacturers and outsourcing partners, and our efforts to maintain and increase revenue in international markets are subject to a number of risks, which are generally greater with respect to emerging market countries, including the following:\n\u2022growth and stability of the economy in one or more international regions, including regional economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards;\n\u2022import and export license requirements, tariffs, taxes, economic sanctions, contractual limitations and other trade barriers;\n\u2022our significant reliance on resellers and others to purchase and resell our products and solutions, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u2022availability of credit, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u2022longer collection periods and greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, especially from smaller customers and resellers, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u2022compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and/or similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u2022the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, treaties and technical standards;\n\u2022fulfilling \u201ccountry of origin\u201d requirements for our products for certain customers;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social and/or economic instability and unrest (e.g., Ukraine), including risks related to terrorist activity, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u2022changes in economic policies by foreign governments, including the imposition and potential continued expansion of economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union on the Russian Federation;\n\u2022changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade protection measures, import or export requirements, trade embargoes and other trade barriers, including those between the United States and China;\n\u2022any negative economic impacts resulting from the political environment in the United States or the United Kingdoms\u2019 exit from the European Union; and\n\u2022business and economic disruptions and delays caused by outbreaks of disease, epidemics and potential pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led and may continue to lead to trade shows and in-person meetings being canceled or delayed and employees working remotely, and which has impacted our supply chain and may continue to impact our supply chain or general business in other manners.\nWe have certain international customers who are billed in their local currency, primarily the Euro, British pound and Japanese yen, which subjects us to foreign currency risk. In addition, a portion of our operating expenses relating to the cost of certain international employees, are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Israeli shekel, British pound, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan and Indian rupee. Although we do hedge against the Euro, British pound, Israeli shekel and Japanese yen, gains and losses on the conversion to U.S. dollars of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. Furthermore, payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the United States. Unpredictable payment cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period.\nMost of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region, leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability from sales in that country or region. The potential negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar on our business may be exacerbated by the significant devaluation of a number of foreign currencies. Also, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken against many foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that a weaker dollar would lead to growth in customer spending in foreign markets.\nOur operations outside the United States also require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international regulations that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for corrupt purposes. For example, our operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. Our activities in certain emerging countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or channel partners that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws, even though these parties may not be under our control. Under the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by their directors, officers, employees, channel partners, sales agents, consultants, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. We have internal control policies and procedures with respect to FCPA compliance, have implemented FCPA training and compliance programs for our employees, and include in our agreements with resellers a requirement that those parties comply with the FCPA. However, we cannot provide assurances that our policies, procedures and programs will prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws by our employees or agents, particularly in emerging market countries, and as we expand our international operations. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in criminal or civil sanctions against us.\nThe effect of one or more of these international risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nSome anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nWe have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board. These include provisions:\n\u2022authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022limiting the ability of our stockholders to call, and bring business before, special meetings;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board;\n\u2022controlling the procedures for conducting and scheduling of Board and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022providing our Board with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.\nThese provisions could delay hostile takeovers, changes in control of the Company or changes in our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur common stock price may be extremely volatile, and the value of an investment in our stock may decline.\nOur common stock price has been highly volatile. We expect that this volatility will continue in the future due to factors such as:\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, including market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022increases or decreases in the general stock market or to the stock prices of technology companies;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations, new products or new services by us or by our competitors or customers;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022announcements by our customers regarding end user market conditions and the status of existing and future infrastructure network deployments;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022future equity or debt offerings or our announcements of these offerings.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Select Market and the securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. In these circumstances, investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price over the short term, or at all.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100 million of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchase program expires in February 2025 and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Share repurchases will be made from time to time in open market purchases and 10b5-1 trading plans, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. Any share repurchases remain subject to the circumstances in place at that time, including prevailing market prices. As a result, there can be no guarantee around the timing or volume of our share repurchases. The stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility and diminish our cash reserves. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\nOur stock price may decline if additional shares are sold in the market or if analysts drop coverage of or downgrade our stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we issue additional shares upon exercise of stock options, including under our 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and in connection with grants of restricted stock units on an ongoing basis. To the extent we do not elect to pay solely cash upon conversion of the Notes, we will also be required to issue additional shares of common stock upon conversion. Increased sales of our common stock in the market after exercise of outstanding stock options or grants of restricted stock units could exert downward pressure on our stock price. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the availability of research and reports that third-party industry or securities analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the liquidity of our stock and our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 81621, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "HLIT"}
