RISK FACTORS\nBefore investing in Mid Penn common stock, an investor should carefully consider the risk factors described below, which are not intended to be all inclusive, and to review other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Mid Penn. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem less significant, or that we are otherwise not specifically focused on, may also impact our business, results of operations, and our common stock. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and an investor could lose all or part of his or her investment in Mid Penn.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cMid Penn,\u201d or \u201cMid Penn Bancorp, Inc.,\u201d collectively refer to Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. and its banking subsidiary, and specific references to the \u201cBank\u201d refer to Mid Penn Bank, the wholly-owned banking subsidiary of Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Primary Business and Industry\nMid Penn is subject to interest rate risk\nMid Penn\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Mid Penn\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest income Mid Penn receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest expense it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) Mid Penn\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of Mid Penn\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of Mid Penn\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, Mid Penn\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.\nManagement believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on Mid Penn\u2019s results of operations. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged, or rapid change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn is subject to credit risk\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 83 percent of Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio in Table 8 of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis consisted of commercial, industrial and agricultural, construction, and commercial real estate loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or secured consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses may be insufficient\nMid Penn maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires Mid Penn to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem credits and other factors, both within and outside of Mid Penn\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Mid Penn\u2019s allowance for possible loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance, Mid Penn may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan and lease losses. Any increases in the allowance resulting from loan loss provisions will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nCompetition from other financial institutions may adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s profitability\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating both commercial and consumer loans. This competition comes principally from other banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of its larger competitors who offer loans enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce Mid Penn\u2019s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of Mid Penn\u2019s larger competitors who accept deposits enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition, and more convenient branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than Mid Penn, which could decrease the deposits that Mid Penn attracts or require Mid Penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, Mid Penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary also competes with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies and governmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of its non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive and costly regulations that govern its banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over Mid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit Mid Penn\u2019s margins on banking services, reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition.\nThe Basel III capital requirements require us to maintain higher levels of capital, which could reduce our profitability\nBasel III targets higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital. Although the new capital requirements are continuing to be phased in through January 1, 2019, Basel III signals a growing effort by domestic and international bank regulatory agencies to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain higher levels of capital. The Basel III implementation activities and related regulatory capital targets require additional capital to support our business risk profile prior to final implementation of the Basel III standards. Mid Penn may be required to maintain higher levels of capital, thus potentially reducing opportunities to invest capital into interest-earning assets, which could limit the profitable business operations available to Mid Penn, and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Mid Penn\u2019s information systems are interrupted or sustain a breach in security, those events may negatively affect Mid Penn\u2019s financial performance and reputation\nIn conducting its business, Mid Penn relies heavily on its information systems. Maintaining and protecting those systems and data is difficult and expensive, as is dealing with any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems, whether due to acts or omissions by Mid Penn or by a third party, and whether intentional or not. Any such failure, interruption, or breach could result in failures or disruptions in Mid Penn\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. A breach of Mid Penn\u2019s information security may result from fraudulent activity committed against Mid Penn or its clients, resulting in financial loss to Mid Penn or its clients, or privacy breaches against Mid Penn\u2019s clients. Such fraudulent activity may consist of check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, \u201cphishing\u201d, social engineering, identity theft, or other deceptive acts. The policies, procedures, and technical safeguards put in place by Mid Penn to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption, or security breach of its information systems and data may be insufficient to prevent or remedy the effects of any such occurrences. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of Mid Penn\u2019s information systems and data could damage Mid Penn\u2019s reputation, cause Mid Penn to incur additional expenses, result in online services or other businesses becoming inoperable, subject Mid Penn to regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose Mid Penn to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn\u2019s business operations and interaction with customers are increasingly done via electronic means, and this has increased risks related to cyber security\nMid Penn is exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. An increased level of attention in the industry is focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. To combat against these attacks, Mid Penn has policies and procedures in place to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of its information systems and it has insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks. While Mid Penn has not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, nor is it aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, it may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if it falls victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that cyber-attacks may have caused; deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nMid Penn\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented\nManagement periodically reviews and updates Mid Penn\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on performance by personnel or certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of Mid Penn\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are required to make a number of judgments in applying generally accepted accounting standards, and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these accounting standards could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to our reports of financial condition and results of operations\nGenerally accepted accounting standards involving estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, the fair value of certain financial instruments including investment securities, income tax assets or liabilities (including deferred tax assets and any related valuation allowance), and share-based compensation. While we have identified critical accounting policies and have procedures and processes in place to support making the related judgments and estimates, changes to the processes, assumptions, or models in the application of these generally accepted accounting standards, and the impact to the related judgments and estimates could result in a decrease to net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC issues changes to or updated interpretations of the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of Mid Penn\u2019s financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised guidance could also result in material adverse effects to our reported capital.\nMid Penn\u2019s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in Pennsylvania\nUnlike larger or regional financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, Mid Penn\u2019s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in Pennsylvania, especially in the central part of the State including Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Luzerne, Northumberland, and Schuylkill Counties, which were the counties and markets primarily served by Mid Penn in the years up to and including 2017. In addition, with the acquisition of The Scottdale Bank and Trust Company effective January 8, 2018, Mid Penn has begun to serve customers in Western Pennsylvania with five offices located in Westmoreland and Fayette Counties. The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation, recession, unemployment, real estate values, trends in national and global economics, and other factors beyond our control. An economic recession or a delayed recovery over a prolonged period of time in Pennsylvania, or more specific to the areas in the State served by Mid Penn, could cause an increase in the level of the Bank\u2019s non-performing assets and loan and lease losses, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity, and eroding capital. Mid Penn cannot assure that adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel\nMid Penn\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain qualified, key personnel. Competition for the best personnel in most activities engaged in by Mid Penn can be intense, and Mid Penn may not be able to hire or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of Mid Penn\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on Mid Penn\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of Mid Penn\u2019s market, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nMid Penn is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility\nFrom time to time, customers may make claims and take legal action pertaining to Mid Penn\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to Mid Penn\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to Mid Penn, the claims or related litigation processes may result in significant financial expense and liability, and/or adversely affect the market perception of Mid Penn and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations\nMid Penn is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on Mid Penn and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect Mid Penn\u2019s powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on Mid Penn\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy, or changes in supervisory activities, to affect many aspects of Mid Penn\u2019s operations, including capital levels, lending and funding practices, and liquidity standards. New laws and regulations may increase costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect operations, and may significantly affect the markets in which Mid Penn does business, the markets for and value of Mid Penn\u2019s loans and investments, the ability to attract deposits at a reasonable cost, the fees charged, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect Mid Penn\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Mid Penn has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose Mid Penn to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, Mid Penn\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Mid Penn cannot be readily realized or liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to Mid Penn. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPrior levels of market volatility were unprecedented and future volatility may have materially adverse effects on our liquidity and financial condition\nIn the recent past, the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on stock prices, security prices, and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength. If such levels of market disruption and volatility return, there can be no assurance that Mid Penn will not experience adverse effects, which may materially affect its liquidity, financial condition, and profitability.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments which may adversely affect its earnings\nPoor economic conditions and the resulting bank failures from the most recent recession have stressed the DIF and increased the costs of Mid Penn\u2019s FDIC insurance assessments. Additional bank failures may prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue special assessments. Mid Penn generally is unable to control the amount of premiums or special assessments that its banking subsidiary is required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock at the current rate or at all.\nIf we conclude that the decline in the value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings\nMid Penn reviews its investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the fair value of individual securities or the portfolio as a whole is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of its investment securities has declined below its carrying value, Mid Penn is required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary. If Mid Penn concludes that the decline is other than temporary, it is required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings. Changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and/or prolonged price declines may result in Mid Penn concluding that impairment of these securities is other than temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down these securities to their fair value. Due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset is impaired, the impairment disclosed, or lack thereof, may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future.\nMid Penn is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities\nA significant portion of Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, Mid Penn may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Mid Penn may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require Mid Penn to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit Mid Penn\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws, may increase Mid Penn\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although Mid Penn has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s financial performance may suffer if its information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments\nEffective and competitive delivery of Mid Penn\u2019s products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes, both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables Mid Penn to reduce costs. Mid Penn\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of Mid Penn\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Additionally, as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves, keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for Mid Penn. There can be no assurance that Mid Penn will be able to effectively, and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowing By Acquisition Entails Certain Risks\nOn January 8, 2018, we completed a merger acquisition The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company and on January 16, 2018, we entered into an agreement providing for the acquisition of First Priority Financial Corp., which transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, pending receipt of required regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions. Growth by acquisition involves risks. The success of our acquisitions may depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of the acquired company with our businesses in a manner that does not result in decreased revenues resulting from disruption of existing customer relationships of the acquired company. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than planned.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nFurther, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a company we plan to acquire may deteriorate between the date a merger or other acquisition agreement is entered into and the transaction is completed. Depending upon the terms we negotiate in the related merger or acquisition agreement, the deterioration may not allow us to fail to close the proposed transaction, such that we may be required to close the proposed transaction with such a company to the detriment of our future financial condition.\nAdditionally, if a pending acquisition is not completed due to the failure to satisfy certain conditions or otherwise, expenses incurred in connection therewith could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition because we would not have realized the expected benefits.\nDifficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business\nWe have spent and may continue to spend significant resources identifying businesses to acquire. The efficient and effective integration of any businesses we acquire into our organization is critical to our growth. The Scottdale Merger, the First Priority Merger, and any future mergers or acquisitions, involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the culture, operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of customers. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of Scottdale and First Priority could also harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe plan to pursue a growth strategy and there are risks associated with rapid growth\nWe intend to pursue a growth plan consistent with our prior business strategy, including growth by acquisition, as well as leveraging our existing branch network and adding new branch locations in current and adjacent markets we choose to serve. The Scottdale Merger and First Priority Merger were part of our growth strategy.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions and competition. If we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel, control costs and maintain asset quality, this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe interest rate on our subordinated notes will remain fixed until December 2020, when some will begin to float to Prime plus 0.50%\nThe per annum interest rate on the $7.5 million of our subordinated notes issued in December 2015 is fixed at 5.15%, until December 2020 when the interest rate will float at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Prime rate plus 0.50%, provided that the interest rate applicable will at no time be less than 4.0%. The per annum interest rate on the $10 million of our subordinated notes issued in December 2017 is fixed at 5.25% until December 2022, when it will float at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Prime rate plus 0.50%, provided that the interest rate applicable will at no time be less than 5.0%. Depending on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition at the time of these rates changing from fixed to variable, an increase in the interest rate on our subordinated debt could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Mid Penn Common Stock\nThe trading volume in Mid Penn\u2019s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies\nMid Penn\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ; however, the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which Mid Penn has no control. Given the generally lower trading volume of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock, significant sales of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause Mid Penn\u2019s stock price to fall.\nThe market price of Mid Penn common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for investors to resell shares of common stock owned by them at times or at prices they find attractive\nThe market price of our common stock as reported on NASDAQ is subject to constant change during business trading hours. We expect that the market price of Mid Penn common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurance about the stability or trend of market prices for Mid Penn common stock. Stock price volatility may make it difficult for investors to resell their Mid Penn common stock when they want and at times or prices that they find attractive. Mid Penn\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include those described elsewhere in this entire \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, in this document, and our other filings with the SEC.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, and principal and interest on its subordinated notes, depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiary, which is subject to regulatory limits\nMid Penn is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries, primarily the Bank. Its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and principal and interest on its subordinated notes depends on its receipt of dividends from the Bank. Dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings, imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to profitability, financial condition, liquidity, and capital management limits. There is no assurance that Mid Penn\u2019s subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that Mid Penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future. Federal Reserve policy, which applies to Mid Penn as a registered bank holding company, also provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of earnings from both the current period and a designated look-back period. Mid Penn\u2019s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock.\nMid Penn may need to, or be required to, raise additional capital in the future, and capital may not be available when needed and on terms favorable to current stockholders\nFederal banking regulators require Mid Penn and its subsidiary bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation, and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by Mid Penn\u2019s management and board of directors, based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support Mid Penn\u2019s business operations.\nIf Mid Penn raises capital through merger and acquisition activities, or through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities, it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on Mid Penn\u2019s stock price. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to Mid Penn\u2019s current common stockholders, which may adversely impact its current common stockholders.\nMid Penn\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, Mid Penn cannot be certain of its ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms and acceptable time frames or to raise additional capital at all. If Mid Penn cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed, its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOfferings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock\nWe may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings are likely to receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nPennsylvania Business Corporation Law and various anti-takeover provisions under our articles of incorporation and bylaws could impede the takeover of Mid Penn\nVarious Pennsylvania laws affecting business corporations may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire Mid Penn, even if the acquisition would be advantageous to shareholders. In addition, we have various anti-takeover measures in place under our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including a supermajority vote requirement for mergers, the staggered election of Mid Penn\u2019s board of directors, and the absence of cumulative voting. Any one or more of these laws or measures may impede the takeover of Mid Penn without the approval of our board of directors and may prevent our shareholders from taking part in a transaction in which they could realize a premium over the current market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is not insured by any governmental entity\nAlthough Mid Penn and the Bank are regulated by governmental agencies, Mid Penn common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of the Bank or any other bank and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, any other governmental entity or by any other public or private entity. Investment in Mid Penn common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described elsewhere in this entire \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, in this document, and our other filings with the SEC. Mid Penn common stock is also subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any other public traded company. As a result, investors who acquire Mid Penn common stock may lose some or all of their investment.", "PERMNO": 85656, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MPB"}
