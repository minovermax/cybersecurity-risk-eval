Before purchasing our common stock, you should read and consider carefully the following risk factors as well as all other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial, which could also impair our business and financial position. If any of the events described below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of operations and/or our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. As a result, you could lose some or all of any investment you may make in our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have experienced a fire at our TRIC facility which has caused significant damage and, as a result of the fire, we revised our plans for the commercialization of our AquaRefining technologies. However, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful. On the evening of November 29, 2019, a fire occurred at our LAB recycling facility at TRIC. The cause of ignition is likely related to on-site contractor work that was being performed on the day of the fire. The fire was substantially contained to the AquaRefining area of the plant, however the fire destroyed or impaired beyond recovery substantially all of the AquaRefining equipment, including all 16 AquaRefining modules, control wiring and other supporting infrastructure.\nWhen we designed and developed TRIC, we did so at a time when our business model assumed that TRIC would be the first of many LAB recycling facilities owned and operated by us. Commencing in 2017, we began to shift our focus away from the development of additional Company-owned LAB recycling facilities and towards the licensing of our AquaRefining technology to partners engaged in LAB recycling. We continued to develop TRIC as a LAB recycling facility for purposes of demonstrating AquaRefining on a commercial scale. However, as a result of the fire and our high costs of capital, we decided that the cost of restoring TRIC to its pre-fire state would not be the best use of our available cash and that we may be able to achieve the benefits of operating 16 AquaRefining modules, namely the demonstration of the scalability of our AquaRefining technologies, through a less costly commercialization program. Commencing in early 2020, we began to focus on licensing opportunities within the $20+ billion lead battery recycling marketplace. We believe this path is far less capital intensive than a rebuild of TRIC to its pre-fire state and we believe this plan could be funded solely or primarily from cash on hand plus any further insurance proceeds and asset disposition of the AquaRefinery. However, there can be no assurance that our revised business model will be successful or that we will acquire the additional capital sufficient to fund our revised business plan.\nOur business strategy includes licensing arrangements and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances, however as of the date of this report we have no such agreements in place and there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Failure to successfully integrate such licensing arrangements, joint ventures, or strategic alliances into our operations could adversely affect our business. We propose to commercially exploit our AquaRefining process primarily by licensing our technology to third parties and entering into joint ventures and strategic relationships with parties involved in the manufacture and recycling of LABs, including Clarios, among others. Although we are currently seeking to negotiate such an agreement with Clarios as further discussed herein, as of the date of this report, we have not entered into any such licensing, joint venture or strategic alliance agreements, apart from our equipment supply agreement with Clarios, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on terms that benefit us, if at all. Our ability to enter into licensing, joint ventures and strategic relationships with third parties will depend on our ability to demonstrate the technological and commercial advantages of our AquaRefining process, of which there can be no assurance. Also, even if we are able to enter into licensing, joint venture or strategic alliance agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the expected benefits of any such arrangements. In addition, licensing programs, joint ventures and strategic alliances may involve significant other risks and uncertainties, insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the transaction, potential additional challenges in protecting our intellectual property, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, such as product quality, technology issues and legal contingencies. In addition, we may be unable to effectively integrate any such programs and ventures into our operations. Our operating results could be adversely affected by any problems arising during or from any licenses, joint ventures or strategic alliances.\nSince we have a limited operating history and have only recently commenced revenue producing operations, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. We formed our corporation in June 2014 and only commenced revenue producing operations in the first quarter of 2017. From inception through December 31, 2020, we generated a total of $11.5 million of revenue, all of which was derived primarily from the sale of lead compounds and plastics and, to a lesser extent, the sale of lead bullion and AquaRefined lead. To date, our operations have primarily consisted of the development and testing and limited operations of our AquaRefining process, the construction of our initial LAB recycling facility at TRIC, the continuing development of our LAB recycling operations at TRIC and limited revenue producing operations as we brought those LAB recycling operations online. As a result of the November 2019 fire at TRIC, we have suspended all plant-based revenue producing operations and have shifted our business model to focus exclusively on the licensing of our AquaRefining technology to partners engaged in LAB recycling. As of the date of this report, we are unable to estimate when we expect to commence any meaningful commercial or revenue producing operations from our licensing model. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations. As an early stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications and delays in a new business, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of our plan of commercialization and the fact that we have suspended operations at TRIC;\n\u2022\nour ability to demonstrate that our AquaRefining technology can be operated on a commercial scale;\n\u2022\nour ability to license our AquaRefining process and sell our AquaRefining equipment to recyclers of LABs; and\n\u2022\nour ability to realize the expected benefits of our strategic partnerships with Clarios and BASF.\nInvestors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nOur business is dependent upon our successful implementation of novel technologies and processes and there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement such technologies and processes in a manner that supports the successful commercial roll-out of our business model. While much of the technology and processes involved in lead recycling operations are widely used and proven, our AquaRefining process is largely novel and, to date, has been demonstrated on a modest scale of operations. While we have shown that our proprietary technology can produce AquaRefined lead on a small scale, we had just begun to demonstrate that we can produce AquaRefined lead on a commercial scale prior to the November 2019 fire at TRIC. Further, as we endeavored to complete our AquaRefining production line, we continuously encountered unforeseen complications that delayed the ramping up of our AquaRefining modules and the integration of our AquaRefining process with the traditional lead recycling operations. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar unforeseen complications as we pursue our revised business model.\nWe may need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2020, we had total cash of $6.5 million and working capital of $4.9 million. As of the date of this report, we believe that we may require additional capital in order to fund our current level of ongoing costs and our proposed business plan over the next 12 months as we move forward with our capital light licensing strategy. We intend to acquire the necessary capital though the recovery of insurance proceeds on our fire related claims and the possible sale of certain equipment and assets at TRIC. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect insurance proceeds or acquire proceeds from the sale of TRIC in amounts sufficient to fund the capital requirements or, if we are successful, that we will not require additional capital. If needed, we may seek funding through the sale of equity or debt financing. Funding that includes the sale of our equity may be dilutive. If such funding is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, this coronavirus spread to other countries, including the United States, and efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus intensified. At this time, we and most of our partners and suppliers are subject to travel restrictions, shelter in place requirements and limited, if any, operations. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that we or our partners and suppliers may take in respect of this coronavirus may result in a period of disruption to work in progress. Our partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses could be disrupted, and our ongoing and future recovery from the TRIC fire, resumption of limited V1.25L operations and license negotiations could be negatively affected. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our business and financial condition. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nWe have elected not to renew our current agreement with Veolia and it is unlikely that we will continue to partner with Veolia. In February 2019, we entered into an Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement with Veolia North America Regeneration Services, LLC, or Veolia. Pursuant to the Agreement, Veolia agreed to provide development of operations programs, start-up of new equipment and operations, maintenance and management services at our AquaRefining facility at TRIC. As a result of the November 2019 fire at TRIC, we have suspended all operations at TRIC pending our clean-up of the fire damage and development of our plan for resuming operations. In January 2020, we declared a force majeure under the Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement and suspended payments to Veolia thereunder. The Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement included an initial term expiring March 6, 2021 and an automatic renewal provision unless either party elects not to renew. We have elected not to renew the Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement and it is presently scheduled to terminate on March 6, 2021.\nOur business model is new and has not been proven by us or anyone else. We are engaged in the business of producing recycled lead through a novel, and proven on a modest scale, technology. While the production of recycled lead is an established business, to date all recycled lead has been produced by way of traditional smelting processes. To our knowledge, no one has successfully produced recycled lead in commercial quantities other than by way of smelting. In addition, neither we nor anyone else has ever successfully built a production line that commercially recycles LABs without smelting. Further, there can be no assurance that either we or our licensees will be able to produce AquaRefined lead in commercial quantities at a cost of production that will provide us and our proposed licensees with an adequate profit margin. The uniqueness of our AquaRefining process presents potential risks associated with the development of a business model that is untried and unproven.\nEven if our licensees are successful in recycling lead using our processes, there can be no assurance that the AquaRefined lead will meet the certification and purity requirements of our potential customers. A key component of our business plan is the production of recycled lead through our AquaRefining process of the highest purity (at least 99.99% pure lead), which we refer to as AquaRefined lead. We believe that our AquaRefined lead will provide our licensees with a revenue premium over the market price of lead on the London Metal Exchange, or LME, and, more importantly, the ability to produce AquaRefined lead will be vital to confirming the efficacy and relevancy of our proprietary technology. Our licensees and their customers will require that our AquaRefined lead meet certain minimum purity standards and, in all likelihood, require independent assays to confirm the lead\u2019s purity. As of the date of this report, we have produced limited quantities of AquaRefined lead and in November 2018, Clarios confirmed its approval of the purity of our AquaRefined lead by providing to us official vendor approval to receive finished lead at its manufacturing facilities. However, we have not produced AquaRefined lead in significant commercial quantities and there can be no assurance that our licensees will be able to do so or, if our licensees are able to produce AquaRefined lead in significant commercial quantities, that such lead will continue to meet the required purity standards of their customers.\nWhile we have been successful in producing AquaRefined lead in small volumes, there can be no assurance that either we or our licensees will be able to replicate the process, along with all of the expected economic advantages, on a large commercial scale either for us or our prospective licensees. Our commercial operations have primarily involved the production of lead compounds and plastics from recycled LABs, and more recently, the sale of lead bullion and AquaRefined lead. In April 2018, we commenced the limited production of cast lead bullion (mixture of lead purchased to prime the kettles and AquaRefined lead from our AquaRefining process), and in June 2018, we commenced the sale of pure AquaRefined lead in the form of two tonne blocks. While we believe that our development, testing and limited production to date has validated the concept of our AquaRefining process, the limited nature of our operations to date are not sufficient to confirm the economic returns on our production of recycled lead. There can be no assurance that our licensees will be able to produce AquaRefined lead in commercial quantities at a cost of production that will provide us and our proposed licensees with an adequate profit margin.\nOur business may be negatively affected by labor issues and higher labor costs. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing employees. As of the date of this report, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our labor relations to be acceptable. However, we could experience workforce dissatisfaction which could trigger bargaining issues, employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and benefit consequences, especially during critical operation periods. We could also experience a work stoppage or other disputes which could disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results. In addition, legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages and higher labor costs. There can be no assurance that we may not experience labor issues that negatively impact our operations or results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business. As of the date of this report, we have secured granted/allowed patents in the following countries/regions: U.S. (9837689, 10665907, 10793957, 10689769, 10340561, 10316420), Canada (2930945), China (201480071929.1, 201680041675.8, 201680041600.X, 201680041571.7, 201580062811.7), Europe (3072180, 3294916, 3221918, and allowed 3483305), Eurasia (32371, 35532, and allowed 201791004), South Africa (2016/04083, 2017/08454, 2017/08455, 2017/04123, 2018/04384), South Korea (101739414, 101882932, 101926033, 102096976), Honduras (80-2019), India (318321), Indonesia (IDP000061176, IDP000066550), Japan (6173595, 6805240, 6775006, 6592088), Mexico (357027), OAPI (17808, 19078, 18736), Ukraine (118037, 119580), Vietnam (22588) Australia (2014353227, 2015350562, 2016260407, 2017213449, and allowed 2016260408, ARIPO (4995, and allowed AP/P/2017/009999), and Chile (allowed 2018-01459).\nWe also have further patent applications pending in the United States and numerous corresponding patent applications pending in 20 additional jurisdictions relating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. However, no assurances can be given that any patent issued, or any patents issued on our current and any future patent applications, will be sufficiently broad to adequately protect our technology. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patents issued now or in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.\nEven patents issued to us may not stop a competitor from illegally using our patented processes and materials. In such event, we would incur substantial costs and expenses, including lost time of management in addressing and litigating, if necessary, such matters. Additionally, we rely upon a combination of trade secret laws and nondisclosure agreements with third parties and employees having access to confidential information or receiving unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technology to protect our proprietary rights and technology. These laws and agreements provide only limited protection. We can give no assurance that these measures will adequately protect us from misappropriation of proprietary information.\nOur processes may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions. The applied science industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. Though we do not expect to be subject to any of these allegations, any allegation of infringement could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause suspension of operations or force us to enter into royalty, license, or other agreements rather than dispute the merits of such allegation. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings, we may be forced into protracted and costly litigation. We may not be successful in defending such litigation and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate our key agreement with Clarios on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In February 2017, we entered into a series of agreements with Clarios, including an equipment supply agreement pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to work with Clarios on the development of a program for the conversion of Clarios and certain strategic partners of Clarios\u2019 existing lead smelters throughout North and South America, China and Europe to a lead recycling process utilizing our AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services. The equipment supply agreement discusses the development of the conversion program in general terms and contemplates that the parties will enter into a definitive development program agreement that is based on the general terms set forth in the equipment supply agreement and provides more detailed terms and conditions, including the economic obligations and rights of each party. We have agreed not to license our AquaRefining technology and equipment to third parties in the aforementioned regions until such time as we and Clarios have agreed on certain matters relating to the initial conversion of a Clarios facility. In June 2019, we entered into an agreement with Clarios to amend the equipment supply agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to use good faith, commercial best-efforts to conclude the discussion and negotiation of, and enter into, a development program agreement no later than the 90th day following our satisfaction of certain performance criteria agreed upon by Clarios and us, however those performance conditions were based on the operation of 16 AquaRefining modules at TRIC, which is unlikely. If we are unable to agree with Clarios on revised performance standards, we may be unable to sell AquaRefining equipment or license our AquaRefining technology to third-parties until the expiration of the Equipment Supply Agreement in June 2021 or the agreement\u2019s earlier termination. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and conclude a definitive development program agreement with Clarios on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that Clarios will maintain the same level of interest in and commitment to the proposed joint development of our AquaRefining technologies. On May 1, 2019, Johnson Controls International plc announced that it had completed the sale of its battery group assets, formerly held by Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc., to Brookfield Business Partners L.P. The acquired battery group assets now operates under the name Clarios. The agreements and proposed business projects between us and Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. (collectively, the \"Aqua Metals Collaboration\") are now under the control of Clarios, and that certain members of the former management of Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. are now employed in similar capacities by Clarios. We have also been advised that Clarios and Brookfield Business Partners L.P. have expressed their interest in continuing the Aqua Metals Collaboration initiated by us and Johnson Controls Battery Group, Inc. Although there can be no assurance that Clarios currently has, and/or will maintain, the same level of interest in our joint collaboration as its predecessor, as Clarios could, for example, no longer have an interest in our technologies or have competing priorities, we currently have no reason to believe that Clarios and Brookfield Business Partners L.P. have lost interest. In addition, the change of control of the battery group may cause disruptions and distractions that adversely affect its ability to further the Aqua Metals Collaboration. For these and other reasons, Johnson Controls\u2019 sale of its battery group assets to Brookfield Business Partners L.P. could possibly have a material adverse effect on the Aqua Metals Collaboration.\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect our prospects for growth and operating results. Our prospects for growth and operating results will be directly affected by the general global economic conditions of the industries in which our suppliers, partners and customer groups operate. We believe that the market price of our principal product, recycled lead, is relatively volatile and reacts to general global economic conditions. Lead prices decreased from $2,139 per tonne on May 5, 2015 to a low of $1,554 per tonne on November 23, 2015 because of fluctuations in the market. Lead price per tonne was approximately $2,018 at the end of December 2020. Our business will be highly dependent on the economic and market conditions in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. These conditions affect our business by reducing the demand for LABs and decreasing the price of lead in times of economic downturn and increasing the price of used LABs in times of increasing demand of LABs and recycled lead. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not negatively impact our liquidity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the United States. A part of our strategy involves our pursuit of growth opportunities in certain international market locations. We intend to pursue licensing or joint venture arrangements with local partners who will be primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations. Any expansion outside of the US will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop and operate any such facilities, including the sales, supply and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. Our international operations expose us to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:\n\u2022\nincreased cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndiminished ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nheightened price sensitivities from customers in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish or contract for local manufacturing, support and service functions;\n\u2022\nlocalization of our LABs and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Federal Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlaws favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\nweaker legal protections of contract terms, enforcement on collection of receivables and intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;\n\u2022\nmarket disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the United States;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers\u2019 councils and labor unions;\n\u2022\nissues related to differences in cultures and practices; and\n\u2022\nchanging regional economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nU.S. government regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns may adversely affect our business. Our operations and the operations of our licensees in the United States will be subject to the federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of lead acid batteries including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"OSHA\") of 1970 and comparable state statutes. Our facilities and the facilities of our licensees will have to obtain environmental permits or approvals to expand, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. We and our licensees may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our respective facilities. In addition to permitting requirements, our operations and the operations of our licensees are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead and acids involved in battery reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead.\nWe and our licensees are also subject to inspection from time to time by various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies and, as a result of these inspections, we and our licensees may be cited for certain items of non-compliance. For example, in August 2018, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or Nevada OSHA, delivered to us a citation and notification of penalty. The citation listed a number of items related to our compliance with Nevada OSHA\u2019s Lead Standard. We reached a settlement agreement with Nevada OSHA on the amount of penalties associated with the citation. We also agreed to engage a lead compliance expert to audit our facility at TRIC for compliance with all provision of the Lead Standard and to generate a written report with findings of any noncompliance, recommended corrective actions, and a time frame to correct the findings of noncompliance. We agreed with Nevada OSHA to correct all findings of noncompliance within the time frame proposed by the lead compliance expert in their report. The lead compliance expert has been engaged, has visited the facility at TRIC and has completed the written report. We have corrected all findings of noncompliance in a timely manner.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws could subject our business and the businesses of our licensees to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. In addition, in the event we are unable to operate and expand our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally responsible, we and our licensees may face opposition from local governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\nThe development of new AquaRefining technology by us or our partners or licensees, and the dissemination of our AquaRefining process will depend on our ability to acquire necessary permits and approvals, of which there can be no assurance. As noted above, our AquaRefining processes will have to obtain environmental permits or approvals to operate, including those associated with air emissions, water discharges, and waste management and storage. In addition, we expect that any use of AquaRefining operations at our partner's facilities will require additional permitting and approvals. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary permits and approvals could prevent us and our partners and licensees from pursuing additional AquaRefining expansion, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects. Further, the loss of any necessary permit or approval could result in the closure of an AquaRefining facility and the loss of our investment associated with such facility.\nOur business involves the handling of hazardous materials and we may become subject to significant fines and other liabilities in the event we mishandle those materials. The nature of our operations involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead or acids, into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. We are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. Any such liability could result in judgments or settlements that restrict our operations in a manner that materially adversely effects our operations and could result in fines, penalties or awards that could materially impair our financial condition and even threaten our continued operation as a going concern.\nWe will be subject to foreign government regulation and environmental, health and safety concerns that may adversely affect our business. As our business expands outside of the United States, our operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the U.S., or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business.\nIn the event we are unable to present and operate our AquaRefining process and operations as safe and environmentally responsible, we may face opposition from local governments, residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our facilities.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our shares may be subject to fluctuation and volatility. You could lose all or part of your investment. The market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since January 1, 2020, the reported high and low sales prices of our common stock have ranged from $0.33 to $8.06 through February 22, 2021. The market price of our shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our shares are covered by analysts;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of technological innovations or new competitive products by others;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments and the decisions of regulatory authorities as to the approval or rejection of new or modified products;\n\u2022\nour sale or proposed sale, or the sale by our significant stockholders, of our shares or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our research and development projects or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our shares; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our shares and result in substantial losses being incurred by our investors. In the past, following periods of market volatility, public company stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could impose a substantial cost upon us and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline. In addition, independent industry analysts may provide reviews of our AquaRefining technology, as well as competitive technologies, and perception of our offerings in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what these industry analysts report, and because industry analysts may influence current and potential customers, our brand could be harmed if they do not provide a positive review of our products and platform capabilities or view us as a market leader.\nWe have received a notice of delisting for failure to satisfy the Nasdaq continued listing rule concerning the composition of our audit committee. On May 19, 2020, Sushil \u201cSam\u201d Kapoor resigned from our board of directors, or Board. Mr. Kapoor was one of three members of the audit committee of our Board. As a consequence of Mr. Kapoor\u2019s resignation, we became out of compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2), which requires that the board of directors of a Nasdaq listed company have an audit committee made up of at least three independent directors. On May 19, 2020, we advised The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC of Mr. Kapoor\u2019s resignation, its consequences with regard to compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(c)(2) and our intention to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) in a timely manner. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(4), we have an automatic cure period in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) until (i) the earlier of our next annual stockholders\u2019 meeting or May 19, 2021; or (ii) if our next annual stockholders\u2019 meeting is held before November 16, 2020, then we must evidence compliance no later than November 16, 2020. We intend to appoint a third independent director to our Board and audit committee, and thereby regain compliance Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2), prior to our next annual meeting of stockholders. However, if we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) in a timely manner, the Nasdaq will commence suspension and delisting procedures.\nA securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit are pending against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A putative consolidated class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit are pending against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers. These lawsuits may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we deny the material allegations in the lawsuits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, defending the lawsuits could result in substantial costs. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future, both related and unrelated to the existing class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits. Such litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, result in substantial costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate to protect us from potential claims; however, we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies and, in any event, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will adequately protect us from claims made. Further, as a result of the pending litigation, the costs of insurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, which might make it more difficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our securities or the availability of our securities for future issuance or sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. Issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the perception that such issuances or sales might occur, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to pursue our business plan and cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\ndo not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholders' proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors, and\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This forum selection provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees.", "PERMNO": 15493, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "AQMS"}
