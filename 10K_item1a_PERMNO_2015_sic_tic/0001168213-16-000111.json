{"cik": "1168213", "company": "AEROPOSTALE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our strategic direction, prospects and future results. Certain factors, including factors outside of our control, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. The following risk factors should be read in connection with evaluating our business and future prospects. All forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after such statements are made. Such uncertainties include, among others, the following factors:\nRisks Relating to our Chapter 11 Filings\nOur voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, our ability to operate and reorganize under the Chapter 11 Cases, and our ability to successfully emerge from bankruptcy are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nOn May 4, 2016, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 proceedings are being jointly administered under the caption \u201cIn re A\u00e9ropostale, Inc., et al.,\u201d Case No. 16-11275. We will continue to operate our business as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe timing of our emergence from bankruptcy and the terms of our emergence may affect our relationship with our creditors, customers, suppliers and employees and have a significant impact on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to continue to operate in bankruptcy and to emerge from bankruptcy will depend on various factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with and operate under the terms of any cash management orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time, which subject us to restrictions on transferring cash and other assets;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain adequate cash on hand and to generate cash from operations throughout the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund our emergence and to fund our operations after emergence from the bankruptcy process on reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees during the pendency of our bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain good customer and supplier relationships in light of developments in our bankruptcy proceedings and the terms of our emergence and our ability to manage contracts that are critical to our operations; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third party motions in Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the bankruptcy proceedings. These risks include:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with the covenants and conditions of the DIP Facility;\n\u2022\nour ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or a sale; and\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our strategic business plan.\nThese risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and employees, as well as with customers, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of opportunities. In addition, while the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the cases, which may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the risks and uncertainties\nassociated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 reorganization process may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of customers and suppliers.\nDifficulties of providing services while attempting to reorganize our businesses in bankruptcy may make it more difficult to maintain and promote our services and attract customers to our services and to keep our suppliers. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience collection issues with otherwise valid receivables of certain customers. Adverse resolution of these disagreements may impact our revenues and other costs of services, both prospectively and retroactively. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of these disagreements. Our suppliers, vendors and services providers may require stricter terms and conditions, and we may not find these terms and conditions acceptable. In addition, we may experience a loss of confidence by current and prospective suppliers, customers, landlords, employees or other stakeholders, which could make it more difficult for us to operate and have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to timely obtain suitable supplies at competitive prices could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified personnel, which could materially affect our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nOur key executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in the retail industry and have made significant contributions to the growth and success of our brands. We are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our key executive officers and other personnel. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles. This uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Any failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile we operate our businesses as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and, in some cases, certain lenders prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with the various creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in-interest and one or more hearings. The creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in-interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process delays major transactions and limits our ability to respond quickly to opportunities and events in the marketplace. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe are beneficial to us.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with the budget or liquidity covenants or other covenants in our DIP Facility, which could result in an event of default under the credit agreements governing the DIP Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe DIP Facility requires the Company to maintain minimum excess availability of at least (a) $25,000,000 during the month of May 2016 and (b) $13,000,000 at all times thereafter. In addition, the DIP Facility includes a covenant that requires the Company to limit expenditures to amounts provided in an agreed DIP budget, subject to certain permitted variances. Furthermore, the DIP Facility includes a series of milestones related to the Chapter 11 Cases. While these milestones allow the Company to simultaneously pursue both a plan of reorganization and a sale process, either path requires the Company to achieve a series of intermediate process benchmarks and, in any event, requires that a plan become effective or a sale be consummated, in either case, within 145 days after the Petition Date. Failure to comply with these covenants or milestones would result in an event of default under the DIP Facility and permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans and otherwise exercise remedies under the loan documentation for the DIP Facility.\nOur DIP Facility contains covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreement governing our DIP Facility contains various covenants that require us to have a specified minimum amount of liquidity. These covenants also limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default, which could prompt the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders under the agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under the agreement.\nWe may not obtain final approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the DIP Facility, which would limit our access to funding for operations.\nThe DIP Facility remains subject to final approval by the Bankruptcy Court. In the event that the DIP Facility is not approved, we will face a liquidity shortfall that, if not resolved, could jeopardize our ability to continue as a going concern and could ultimately result in our liquidation.\nTrading in our securities during the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Our common stock may be canceled and holders of common stock may not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nAt this time it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization on our business, various creditors and security holders, or when it may be possible to emerge from Chapter 11. Trading prices for the Company's securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of the Company's securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. The Company expects that its equity holders could experience a significant or complete loss on their investment, depending on the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur liquidity constraints have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, the consummation of a plan of reorganization and our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the DIP Facility. Further, there can be no assurance that our planned operational improvements, including reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, will be successful.\nRisks Relating to A\u00e9ropostale\u2019s Common Stock\nOur common stock was delisted from the NYSE and is not expected to be listed on any other national securities exchange during our Chapter 11 process.\nTrading in our common stock was suspended and removed from listing on the NYSE on April 21, 2016. We will not be able to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange during our Chapter 11 process, although our common stock has been trading in the over-the-counter, or the \u201cOTC,\u201d market. The trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than NYSE may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders.\nOur common stock is currently traded in the Pink market, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., which involves additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.\nSecurities traded in the OTC market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nBecause our common stock trades on the OTC market, in some cases, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that our exploration of strategic or financial alternatives will result in any transaction being consummated or any other specific action; and speculation and uncertainty regarding the outcome of our exploration of such alternatives may adversely impact our business.\nIn parallel with executing on our reorganization, further to our March 2016 announcement and pursuant to the authorization of the Board of Directors, management is continuing to explore a full range of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. The Company has retained advisors to assist in a review of alternatives. Substantial uncertainty exists as to as to the outcome of these discussions, and there are no assurances that these efforts will result in any transaction, agreement, or any other specific action, which if implemented will be successful, and the process of exploring strategic alternatives will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses.\nFailure to effectively execute or to realize the anticipated benefits of our announced new cost reduction program could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIn January 2016, we announced plans to optimize our cost structure through an aggressive new cost reduction program targeting both direct and indirect spending across the organization, which will also include reducing our corporate headcount. We also announced that as a part of its effort to position the Company for long-term success, we are reviewing our leases and other contracts to ensure they are competitive with current market dynamics and that we are closing 113 U.S. locations, as well as all 41 stores in Canada. Risks related to our cost reduction program include delays in implementation, changes in plans that impact associated costs, impact on employee morale, failure to meet operational and strategic targets and the recording of additional charges. The inability to successfully implement these initiatives or failure to do so as timely as we anticipate, could impact our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may continue to experience declines in comparable store sales and there can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful.\nOur comparable sales have declined by 9% in fiscal 2015, 11% in fiscal 2014 and 15% in fiscal 2013 and we experienced declining operating results over these periods. Our comparable sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nmall traffic and the actions of our competitors or mall anchor tenants;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns;\n\u2022\nfashion trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our inventory management;\n\u2022\ncalendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods;\n\u2022\nthe timing and effectiveness of promotional events;\n\u2022\nweather conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our business reflecting the general peak sales for clothing and accessories during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.\nWe have taken steps focused on executing our key merchandising, operational and financial initiatives to improve our performance. Our ability to fund operations and capital expenditures in the future is dependent on our ability to generate cash from operations to fund our liquidity needs, maintain or improve margins, decrease the rate of decline in store sales and to\nborrow funds available under its loan agreements. In addition, if our comparable sales and/or results of operations fail to meet the expectations of investors then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our strategic initiatives, including our recent initiative to divide our existing stores into a Factory chain and a Mall chain. If such strategic initiatives are not achieved this could have a significant adverse effect on our operations. The inability to access sufficient liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us and we may need to take various actions, which also could have material adverse consequences to us. For further discussion see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for more information.\nA significant decrease in sales or existence of excess inventory could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur net sales are disproportionately higher from August through January each year due to increased sales from back-to-school and holiday shopping. Our net sales from February through July are typically lower due to, in part, the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season. Any significant decrease in sales during any season, but in particular the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, in order to prepare for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products would require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which would reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts which may occur during key selling times such as school holidays, Easter and regional fluctuations in the calendar during the back-to-school selling season.\nIf we cannot revitalize our brand, our business will be adversely impacted.\nAs we discuss above in Item 1. \u201cBusiness,\u201d in the first quarter of 2016 we have taken, and intend to take strategic and operational actions designed to reconnect with our customers to revitalize our brand and return to profitability. However, we cannot be assured that the changes we have made, or the additional actions we are taking or intend to take, will be successful, or that such actions and changes will be successful.\nIf we cannot successfully revitalize our brand, or if the revitalization takes longer than anticipated, our business and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted. If customer purchases lag behind our expectations, we may experience decreased net merchandise sales, negative comparable store sales and higher operating losses.\nWe rely on a small number of vendors to supply a significant amount of our merchandise.\nDuring fiscal 2015 and 2014, we sourced approximately 81% of our merchandise from our top five merchandise vendors. Most of our suppliers could discontinue selling to us at any time. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us, or if an agreement with a supplier is terminated, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we do not own or operate any of our own manufacturing facilities and therefore we depend upon independent third party vendors to manufacture all of the merchandise we sell in our stores. If any of our vendors, especially our primary vendors which manufacture the majority of our merchandise, ship orders to us late, do not meet our quality standards, or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans and we are unable to obtain replacement products in a timely fashion, then there would be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn the event that a vendor fails to deliver merchandise in a timely manner under our contract, we may be forced to find an alternative arrangement. If an alternative arrangement is not possible or practical, it may result in a lack of supply and liquidity constraints. The Company has been in a dispute with MGF Sourcing US, LLC, an affiliate of Sycamore Partners, relating to the Sourcing Agreement. This caused a disruption in the supply of merchandise and resulted in both a liquidity constraint and lost sales. On May 11, 2016, the Company reached an agreement in principle with MGF Sourcing to resolve the dispute subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Sourcing Agreement will terminate when the parties comply with their respective obligations under outstanding orders. The Company plans to obtain its supply from other vendors when the Sourcing Agreement terminates.\nIf we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to consumers' fashion preferences, domestically and/or internationally, in a timely manner, our profitability will decline.\nIf we are not able to keep pace with the rapidly changing fashion trends, both domestically and/or internationally, and consumer apparel tastes, our profitability will decline, as it did in fiscal 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. We produce casual and\nactive, comfortable apparel, some of which displays the \u201cA\u00e9ropostale\u201d, \u201cA\u00e9ro\u201d or \u201cP.S. from A\u00e9ropostale\u201d logo and also fashion oriented apparel. There can be no assurance that fashion trends will not move away from casual clothing or that we will not have to alter our design strategy to reflect changes in consumer preferences. Failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in styles, trends, desired images or brand preferences, and to allocate the mix of product optimally by store criteria has had, and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIndustry conditions are increasingly competitive.\nThe teen and children's specialty retail industries have historically been highly competitive. One of our competitive advantages throughout our history has been our promotional business model. A number of our competitors are now also operating a more promotional business, similar to our own. As a result, we now face increased competition based upon price and promotion. Greater or continued promotional activity in the teen or child specialty retail industries could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls in which we are located.\nIn order to generate customer traffic, we must locate our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls. We cannot control the development of new shopping malls, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, or the success of individual shopping malls. We have experienced a decrease in shopping mall traffic which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store, or the closure of a significant number of shopping malls in which we have stores, either by a single landlord with a large portfolio of malls, or by a number of smaller individual landlords, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe effect of global, national, regional and local economic pressures and conditions may adversely affect our sales.\nOur business is highly sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates (including the high level of teenage unemployment), interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Accordingly, consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products, may decline during recessionary periods and periods of economic uncertainty, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Therefore, our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by economic conditions on a local, regional, national and/or global level. Our customer continues to be adversely impacted by the current macroeconomic environment. In addition, we believe that a decline in mall traffic has adversely affected our results of operations.\nOur ability to react to raw material cost fluctuations, labor and energy prices could reduce our overall profitability.\nGlobal inflationary economic conditions have contributed to our reduced overall profitability. In addition, any reduction in merchandise available to us or any significant increase in the costs to produce that merchandise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have strategies in place to mitigate the rising cost of raw materials and our overall profitability depends on the success of those strategies. Additionally, increases in other costs, including labor and energy, could also adversely impact our results of operations as well.\nInternet sales are subject to numerous risks.\nWe sell merchandise over the internet through our e-commerce websites, www.aeropostale.com, www.ps4u.com and www.gojane.com. Our internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022the successful implementation of new systems and internet or mobile platforms;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems, causing, among other things, website downtimes and other technical failures;\n\u2022reliance on third-party computer hardware/software;\n\u2022rapid technological change;\n\u2022liability for online content;\n\u2022violations of state or federal laws, including those relating to online privacy;\n\u2022credit card fraud; and\n\u2022telecommunications failures and vulnerability to electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nOur failure to successfully address and respond to these risks could reduce internet sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brand.\nClosing stores could result in significant costs to us.\nWe have announced plans to close underperforming stores and could, in the future, decide to close additional stores that are producing losses or that are not as profitable as we expect. If we decide to close any stores before the expiration of their lease terms, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or \u201cbuy out\u201d the remaining term of the lease. We also may incur costs related to the employees at such stores, whether or not we terminate the leases early. Upon any such closure, the closing costs, including fixed assets and inventory write-downs, could adversely affect our results and could adversely affect our cash on hand.\nFailure of new business concepts would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nWe expect that the introduction of new brand concepts will play an important role in our overall business strategy. Our ability to succeed with a new brand concept requires significant expenditures and management attention. Additionally, any new brand is subject to certain risks including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including management and designers, diversion of management's attention from our core A\u00e9ropostale business and the ability to obtain suitable sites for new stores.\nOur revenues, product costs and other expenses are subject to foreign economic and currency risks due to our operations outside of the United States.\nWe have operations in Canada and our vendors, independent manufacturers and licensees are located around the world. The value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies has seen significant volatility recently. While our business is conducted in U.S. dollars (other than our operations in Canada), we source virtually all of our production overseas, all of our licensees operate outside of the United States and we generate revenues in Canada. Cost increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials or products more expensive and more difficult to finance. Additionally, fluctuations in exchange rates could impact the operations of our international licensees, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur foreign sources of production may not always be reliable, which may result in a disruption in the flow of new merchandise to our stores.\nThe large majority of the merchandise that we purchase is manufactured overseas. We generally do not have any long-term merchandise supply contracts with our vendors and the imports of our merchandise by our vendors are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs and quotas. We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: (i) political instability; (ii) labor instability/employee unrest (iii) enhanced security measures at foreign and United States ports, which could delay delivery of goods; (iv) imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from countries in a region within which we do business; (v) imposition of additional or greater duties, taxes, and other charges on imports; (vi) delayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to the failure of our vendors to comply with applicable import regulations; and (vii) delayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to unexpected or significant port congestion or labor unrest at United States ports. Any disruption to our vendors and our foreign sources of production due to any of the factors listed above or due to other unforeseeable events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business could suffer if a manufacturer fails to use acceptable labor practices.\nOur sourcing suppliers and independent manufacturers are required to operate in compliance with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations. While our vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices for our vendors and suppliers, we do not control these third parties or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer, or by one of the sourcing suppliers, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or sourcing supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. To help mitigate this risk, we engage a third party independent contractor to visit the production facilities from which we receive our products. This independent contractor assesses the compliance of the\nfacility with, among other things, local and United States labor laws and regulations as well as foreign and domestic fair trade and business practices.\nBecause of our international licensing operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nModifications and/or upgrades to our information technology systems may disrupt our operations.\nWe regularly evaluate our information technology systems and requirements. Modifications may include replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with replacing, modifying, upgrading, maintaining and expanding these systems, including inaccurate system information, system disruptions and user acceptance and understanding. Information technology system disruptions and inaccurate system information, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, there is no assurance that a successfully implemented system will deliver the anticipated value to us.\nWe could face liability from, or our ability to conduct business could be adversely affected by, government and private actions concerning personally identifiable information, including privacy.\nOur direct marketing business is subject to federal and state laws regarding the collection, maintenance and disclosure of personally identifiable information we collect and maintain in our database. If we do not comply, we could become subject to liability. While these provisions do not currently unduly restrict our ability to operate our business, if those regulations become more restrictive, they could adversely affect our business. In addition, laws or regulations that could impair our ability to collect and use user names and other information on our e-commerce websites may adversely affect our business. For example, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1999, as amended, currently limits our ability to collect personal information from website visitors who may be under age 13. Further, we could be subject to a claim based on other alleged misuse of personal information, such as use for unauthorized marketing purposes. If we violate any of these laws, we could face civil penalties. In addition, the attorneys general of various states review company websites and their privacy policies from time to time. In particular, an attorney general may examine our privacy policies to assure that the policies overtly and explicitly inform users of the manner in which the information they provide will be used and disclosed by the Company. If one or more attorneys general were to determine that our privacy policies fail to conform to state law, we also could face fines or civil penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business. Our failure to appropriately safeguard the personally identifiable information of customers, employees and third parties could subject us to reputational damage and/or legal liability.\nWe rely on a third party to manage the web-hosting, operation, warehousing and order fulfillment for our e-commerce business; any disruption of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our e-commerce business.\nWe rely on one third party, eBay Enterprise Inc., to host our e-commerce websites, warehouse all of the inventory sold through our e-commerce websites, and fulfill all of our e-commerce sales to our customers, excluding GoJane. It also performs additional services to support our e-commerce business. Any significant interruption in the operations of eBay Enterprise Inc., over which we have no control, would have a material adverse effect on our e-commerce business.\nInformation technology system disruption and cyber security risks could harm our net sales, increase our expenses, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on information technology systems for the successful operation of our business, including email communications, the design, manufacture and distribution of our products, marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, processing of credit card transactions, e-commerce activities and the use of social media to interact with our customers. Although we take protective measures, including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology, the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. In addition to our own networks and databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. We also rely on one third-party, eBay Enterprise Inc., to host our e-commerce website, warehouse\nall of the inventory sold through our e-commerce website, and fulfill all of our e-commerce sales to our customers. It also performs additional services for us to support our e-commerce business. We collect, retain and transmit confidential information over such systems. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future in their systems. We have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. Despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events.\nAny misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our customers, employees, third parties and investors. We maintain cyber liability insurance coverage for risks including third party claims alleging personal injury, damage caused by breach of network, third party intellectual property damage claims via website and advertising, customer information stolen, as well as costs of response, legal and regulatory penalties. We could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with applicable federal, state or international laws and regulations governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as well as increased costs such as organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees, engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber security breach. We have not experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber security breach or other act, however, a cyber security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to manage our distribution centers and transport our merchandise to our stores; a disruption of our distribution activities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute our merchandise in a timely manner to our store locations throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. We currently lease and maintain two third-party independently operated distribution facilities, one in South River, New Jersey, and the other in Ontario, California. In addition, we also utilize a third distribution center, located in Canada, which is independently owned and operated. These distribution centers manage the receipt, storage, sortation, packaging and distribution of virtually all of our merchandise.\nThese third parties employ personnel represented by labor unions. Although there have been no work stoppages or disruptions since the inception of our relationships with these third party providers, there can be no assurance that work stoppages or disruptions will not occur in the future. We also use separate third party transportation companies to deliver our merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores. Any failure by any of these third parties to respond adequately to our warehousing, distribution and transportation needs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailure to protect our trademarks adequately could negatively impact our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets.\nWe believe that our key trademarks including A\u00c9ROPOSTALE\u00ae, AERO\u00ae and 87\u00ae, LIVE LOVE DREAM\u00ae and P.S. FROM A\u00c9ROPOSTALE\u00ae and variations thereof, are integral to certain aspects of our design strategy. In addition, the trademarks for our GoJane business acquired in late 2012 are important to our business strategy. We have obtained federal registrations of or have pending applications for these trademarks in the United States and have applied for or obtained registrations in most foreign countries in which our merchandise is produced and licensees are located, as well as elsewhere. We use these trademarks in our constantly changing designs and logos even though we have not applied to register every variation or combination thereof for apparel and related accessories. There can be no assurance that the registrations we own and have obtained will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. If any third party imitates our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand image could be materially adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that others will not try to block the manufacture, export or sale of our products to prevent an alleged violation of their trademarks or other proprietary rights. Other entities may have rights to trademarks that contain portions of our marks or may have registered similar or competing marks for apparel and accessories in foreign countries in which products are manufactured are located. There may also be other prior registrations in other foreign countries of which we are not aware. Accordingly, it may not be possible, in those few foreign countries where we were not able to register our marks, to enjoin the manufacture, sale or exportation of A\u00c9ROPOSTALE, P.S. FROM A\u00c9ROPOSTALE or GOJANE branded goods to the United States. If we were unable to reach a licensing arrangement with these parties, our vendors may be unable to manufacture our products in those countries. Our inability to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use\nour trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from or manufacture in less costly markets or enter new markets should our business plan change to include selling our merchandise in those jurisdictions outside the United States.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC and any exchange on which our common stock may be traded from time to time. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock. We are subject to customs, child labor, tax, employment, privacy, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and distribution and fulfillment centers. Additional legal and regulatory requirements, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws, have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment and the cost of compliance. If these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers or distributors, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, legal actions may be filed against us from time to time, including class actions. These actions may assert commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities or other claims. We may also be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common shares, or our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. These may relate to, for example, trademark, servicemark, copyright or other intellectual property matters, employment law matters, commercial disputes, consumer protection claims, claims of regulatory authorities, or other matters. In addition, as a public company we could from time to time face claims relating to corporate or securities law matters. In connection with such litigation, we may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies. Any of such litigation, whether as plaintiff or defendant, could be costly and time consuming and could divert management and key personnel from our regular business operations. We do not currently believe that any of our outstanding litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the uncertainty of litigation and depending on the amount and the timing of any claims, an unfavorable resolution of such claims could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recorded store asset impairment charges in the past and we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.\nPursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to recognize an impairment charge when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. Management\u2019s policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists (i.e., a triggering event) comprises measurable operating performance criteria as well as qualitative measures. If a determination is made that the asset\u2019s carrying value is not recoverable over its estimated useful life, the asset is written down to estimated fair value, if lower. The determination of fair value of the assets is generally based on estimated expected discounted future net cash flows, which is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows identifiable with the long-lived asset at our weighted-average cost of capital. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on certain of these assets. We have recognized impairment charges related to under-performing store locations of approximately $11.1 million in fiscal 2015 for 87 stores, $77.2 million in fiscal 2014 for 341 stores and $46.1 million in fiscal 2013 for 230 stores.\nAdditionally, pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to perform impairment tests on our identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually or at any time when certain events occur, which could impact the value and earnings of our operating segments. Our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of the assets\u2019 estimated fair market values with the assets\u2019 carrying values. Significant and unanticipated changes to these estimates could require impairment charges in a future period that could substantially affect our statement of operations in the period of such change. We recognized impairment charges of $5.1 million in fiscal 2014 for impairments to the GoJane trademark. There were no impairment charges recorded for our identifiable intangible assets in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013.\nAs previously announced, in connection with Chapter 11 cases and the Company\u2019s closure of 113 U.S. locations, as well as all 41 stores in Canada, the Company estimates that it will incur pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges related to these actions totaling approximately $60 million to $70 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2016, which includes approximately $44 million to $56 million of future cash expenses primarily related to lease termination costs.\nChanges in accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance, for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets, leases, income taxes and stock-based compensation are complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or changes in the underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the updated guidance for lease accounting may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nThe effects of war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or other unforeseen wide-scale events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the associated heightened security measures and military actions in response to acts of terrorism have disrupted commerce and have intensified uncertainties in the U.S. economy. Any further acts of terrorism, a future war or a widespread natural disaster may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact our sales revenue by causing consumer spending and/or mall traffic to decline. Furthermore, an act of terrorism or war, or the threat thereof, or any other natural disaster that results in unforeseen interruptions of commerce, could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain merchandise from our vendors.", "PERMNO": 89399, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "AROPQ"}
