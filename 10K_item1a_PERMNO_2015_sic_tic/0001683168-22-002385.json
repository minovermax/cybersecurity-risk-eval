{"cik": "1355848", "company": "Genius Brands International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Relating to our Business\n\u00b7 Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u00b7 We have incurred net losses since inception.\n\u00b7 If we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may not be able to continue our growth.\n\u00b7 Our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.\n\u00b7 The value of our investments is subject to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as other investment risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\u00b7 Changes in the United States, global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of our business.\n\u00b7 Inaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media and movies, fashion, or technology can negatively affect our sales.\n\u00b7 We face competition from a variety of content creators that sell similar merchandise and have better resources than we do.\n\u00b7 The production of our animated content is accomplished through third-party production and animation studios around the world, and any failure of these third parties could negatively impact our business.\n\u00b7 We cannot assure you that our original programming content will appeal to our distributors and viewers or that any of our original programming content will not be cancelled or removed from our distributors\u2019 platforms.\n\u00b7 Failure to successfully market or advertise our products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 The failure of others to promote our products may adversely affect our business.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to keep pace with technological advances.\n\u00b7 Failure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\n\u00b7 Our internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption and cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n\u00b7 Loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business.\n\u00b7 Litigation may harm our business or otherwise distract management.\n\u00b7 Our vendors and licensees may be subject to various laws and government regulations, violation of which could subject these parties to sanctions which could lead to increased costs or the interruption of normal business operations that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Protecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u00b7 Any additional future acquisitions or strategic investments may not be available on attractive terms and would subject us to additional risks.\n\u00b7 We are exposed to investment risk with the acquisition of an equity interest in Your Family Entertainment AG.\n\u00b7 We operate internationally, which exposes us to significant risks.\n\u00b7 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n\u00b7 A decrease in the fair values of our reporting units may result in future goodwill impairments.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\n\u00b7 Our stock price may be subject to substantial volatility, and stockholders may lose all or a substantial part of their investment.\n\u00b7 Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\n\u00b7 If our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell our common stock.\n\u00b7 If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 We are authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock.\n\u00b7 We do not expect to pay dividends in the future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\n\u00b7 Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nRisk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on Page of this Form 10-K.\nYou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread have adversely impacted the global economy, leading to reduced consumer spending and lending activities. Our customers, and therefore our business and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions. We experienced significant revenue declines in several of our markets as a result of COVID-19, primarily due to the supply chain issues that are affecting the toy industry and which are impacting our ChizComm Beacon Media subsidiary. We expect that the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating revenue will continue until health and economic conditions improve.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, consumers, suppliers, business partners and local communities) to responsibly address this global pandemic. We will continue to monitor the situation and assess possible implications to our business and our stakeholders and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new virus variants, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks occurring at any of our facilities, the actions taken to control the spread of COVID-19 or treat its impact, and changes in worldwide and U.S. economic conditions. Further deteriorations in economic conditions, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could lead to a further or prolonged decline in demand for our products and services and negatively impact our business. It may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing. We cannot at this time predict the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic impact, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as our ability to protect our information technology networks and infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malware, phishing and other events that could have a security impact as a result of our remote working environment or otherwise. On March 15, 2022, we began implementing our \u201cReturn to Office\u201d plan.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception.\nWe have a history of operating losses and incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated net revenues of $7.9 million and incurred a net loss of $126.3 million, while for the previous year, we generated net revenue of $2.5 million and incurred a net loss of $401.7 million. These losses, among other things, have had an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, stockholders\u2019 equity, net current assets and working capital.\nWe will need to generate additional revenue and/or reduce costs to achieve profitability. We are beginning to generate revenues derived from our existing properties, properties in production, and new brands being introduced into the marketplace. However, the ability to sustain these revenues and generate significant additional revenues or achieve profitability will depend upon numerous factors some of which are outside of our control.\nIf we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may not be able to continue our growth.\nWe expect that as our business continues to evolve and grow, we will need additional working capital. If adequate additional debt and/or equity financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to expand our business, and we will have to modify our business plans accordingly. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.\nCash flow and projections for any entertainment company producing original content can be expected to fluctuate until the animated content and ancillary consumer products are in the market and could fluctuate thereafter even when the content and products are in the marketplace. There is significant lead time in developing and producing animated content before that content is in the marketplace. Unanticipated delays in entertainment production can delay the release of the content into the marketplace. Structured retail windows that dictate when new products can be introduced at retail are also out of our control. While we believe that we have mitigated this in part by creating a slate of properties at various stages of development or production as well as representing certain established brands which contribute immediately to cash flow, any delays in the production and release of our content and products or any changes in the preferences of our customers could result in lower than anticipated cash flows.\nAs with our cash flows, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly upon the appeal of our content to our customers, the timing of releases of our products and the commercial success of our products, none of which can be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. The results of one period may not be indicative of the results of any future period. Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nProduction cost will be amortized according to the individual film forecasting methodology. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue, we would be required to adjust amortization of related production costs. These adjustments would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe value of our investments is subject to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as other investment risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur results of operations are affected by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our excess cash is invested by an external investment management service provider, under the direction of the Company\u2019s management in accordance with the Company\u2019s investment policy. The investment policy defines constraints and guidelines that restrict the asset classes that we may invest in by type, duration, quality and value. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks, and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. The failure of any of the investment risk strategies that we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe value of our investments is exposed to capital market risks, and our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected by realized losses, impairments and changes in unrealized positions as a result of: significant market volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in credit spreads and defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, a reduction in market liquidity, declines in equity prices, changes in national, state/provincial or local laws and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Levels of write-down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of the intent to sell securities that have declined in value as well as actual losses as a result of defaults or deterioration in estimates of cash flows. If we reposition or realign portions of the investment portfolio and sell securities in an unrealized loss position, we will incur an other-than-temporary impairment charge or realized losses. Any such charge may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses, as described in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included herein.\nChanges in the United States, global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nA decrease in economic activity in the United States or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for and sales of our products. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the animated content and consumer products we offer, which could also decrease our revenues, increase our costs, or both.\nWe may experience an adverse impact on our results of operations due to the current geopolitical tensions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The governments of the European Union, the United States, Japan and other jurisdictions have recently announced the imposition of sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as enhanced export controls on certain products and industries. These and any additional sanctions and export controls, as well as any counter responses by the governments of Russia or other jurisdictions, could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the levels of government spending or the global supply chain, with negative implications on the availability and prices of raw materials, energy prices, and our customers, as well as the global financial markets.\nFurther, the global economy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on many factors, including the recovery of the supply chain affecting the toy industry. Any supply chain disruptions could result in loss of revenue, penalties due to delayed production and currency losses, or other unforeseen costs which would negatively impact margins.\nInaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media and movies, fashion, or technology can negatively affect our sales.\nWhile trends in the toddler to tween sector change quickly, we respond to trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending, and expanding our product offerings on an on-going basis. However, we operate in extremely competitive industries where the ultimate appeal and popularity of content and products targeted to this sector can be difficult to predict. We believe our focus on \u201ccontent with a purpose\u201d serves an underrepresented area of the toddler to tween market; however, if the interests of our audience trend away from our current properties toward other offerings based on current media, movies, animated content or characters, and if we fail to accurately anticipate trends in popular culture, movies, media, fashion, or technology, our products may not be accepted by children, parents, or families and our revenues, profitability, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from a variety of content creators that sell similar merchandise and have better resources than we do.\nThe industries in which we operate are competitive, and our results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, competitive pricing, promotional pressures, additional competitor offerings and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Indirectly through our licensing arrangements, we compete for retailers as well as other outlets for the sale and promotion of our licensed merchandise. Our primary competition comes from competitors such as The Walt Disney Company, Nickelodeon Studios, and the Cartoon Network.\nWe have sought a competitive advantage by providing \u201ccontent with a purpose\u201d which are both entertaining and enriching for children and offer differentiated value that parents seek in making purchasing decisions for their children. While we do not believe that this value proposition is specifically offered by our competitors, our competitors have greater financial resources and more developed marketing channels than we do which could impact our ability, through our licensees, to secure shelf space thereby decreasing our revenues or affecting our profitability and results of operations.\nThe production of our animated content is accomplished through third-party production and animation studios around the world, and any failure of these third parties could negatively impact our business.\nAs part of our business model to manage cash flows, we have partnered with a number of third-party production and animation studios around the world for the production of our new content in which these partners fund the production of the content in exchange for a portion of revenues generated in certain territories. We are reliant on our partners to produce and deliver the content on a timely basis meeting the predetermined specifications for that product. The delivery of inferior content could result in additional expenditures by us to correct any problems to ensure marketability. Further, delays in the delivery of the finished content to us could result in our failure to deliver the product to broadcasters to which it has been pre-licensed. While we believe we have mitigated this risk by aligning the economic interests of our partners with ours and managing the production process remotely on a daily basis, any failures or delays from our production partners could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe cannot assure you that our original programming content will appeal to our distributors and viewers or that any of our original programming content will not be cancelled or removed from our distributors\u2019 platforms.\nOur business depends on the appeal of our content to distributors and viewers, which is difficult to predict. Our business depends in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of our original programming content. These factors are difficult to predict and are subject to influences beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment activities. We may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in markets. A change in viewer preferences could cause our original programming content to decline in popularity, which could jeopardize renewal of agreements with distributors. Low ratings or viewership for programming content produced by us may lead to the cancellation, removal or non-renewal of a program and can negatively affect future license fees for such program. If our original programming content does not gain the level of audience acceptance we expect, or if we are unable to maintain the popularity of our original programming, we may have a diminished negotiating position when dealing with distributors, which could reduce our revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the success of any of our current original programming content or generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for new original programming content in the future. This could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure to successfully market or advertise our products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If we or our licensees do not successfully market our products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure of others to promote our products may adversely affect our business.\nThe availability of retailer programs relating to product placement, co-op advertising and market development funds, and our ability and willingness to pay for such programs, are important with respect to promoting our properties. In addition, although we may have agreements for the advertising and promotion of our products through our licensees, we will not be in direct control of those marketing efforts and those efforts may not be done in a manner that will maximize sales of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological advances.\nThe entertainment industry in general, and the music and motion picture industries in particular, continue to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Because of the rapid growth of technology, shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment, it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on potential revenue from, and profitability of, distributing entertainment programming. As it is also impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on our ability to compete effectively in a changing market, if we are not able to keep pace with these technological advances, our revenues, profitability and results from operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption and cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. There may be an increased risk of cybersecurity attacks by state actors due to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Recently, Russian ransomware gangs have threatened to increase hacking activity against critical infrastructure of any nation or organization that retaliates against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could adversely affect our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of such information could result in legal claims or proceedings and damage our reputation.\nLoss of key personnel may adversely affect our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management team, including Andy Heyward, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any member of our core executive management team or other key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not have \u201ckey man\u201d insurance coverage for any of our employees.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and could distract management. For example, lawsuits by licensors, consumers, employees or stockholders could be very costly and disrupt business. We recently had a securities class action and derivative shareholder action filed against us. While disputes from time to time are not uncommon, we may not be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to us.\nOur vendors and licensees may be subject to various laws and government regulations, violation of which could subject these parties to sanctions which could lead to increased costs or the interruption of normal business operations that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur vendors and licensees may operate in a highly regulated environment in the U.S. and international markets. Federal, state and local governmental entities and foreign governments may regulate aspects of their businesses, including the production or distribution of our content or products. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), product safety and other safety standards, trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, advertising directed toward children, product content, and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. While we believe our vendors and licensees take all the steps necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that they are compliant or will be in compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could increase our costs or decrease our revenue resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete in the animated content and entertainment industry depends, in part, upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property. We protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable companies in specific territories and media for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited, or no, practical protection in some jurisdictions. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or portions of our productions. In addition, although we own most of the music and intellectual property included in our products, there are some titles which the music or other elements are in the public domain and for which it is difficult or even impossible to determine whether anyone has obtained ownership or royalty rights. It is an inherent risk in our industry that people may make such claims with respect to any title already included in our products, whether or not such claims can be substantiated. For example, in July 2020, we received a letter from a law firm alleging that rights that we had licensed from POW!, LLC had already been sold to another company, Proxima. This matter was settled by POW! in November 2021, but the settlement negotiations were costly and required diversion of management attention. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the resulting diversion of resources could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAny additional future acquisitions or strategic investments may not be available on attractive terms and would subject us to additional risks.\nMuch of our growth is attributable to acquisitions. In an effort to implement our business strategies, we may from time to time in the future attempt to pursue other acquisition or expansion opportunities, including strategic investments. To the extent we can identify attractive opportunities, these transactions could involve acquisitions of entire businesses or investments in start-up or established companies and could take several forms. These types of transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of identifying appropriate companies to acquire or invest in on acceptable terms, potential violations of covenants in our debt instruments, insufficient revenue acquired to offset liabilities assumed, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, potential infringements, difficulties integrating the new properties into our operations, and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure. Except as required by law or applicable securities exchange listing standards, we do not expect to ask our shareholders to vote on any proposed acquisition.\nWe are exposed to investment risk with the acquisition of an equity interest in Your Family Entertainment AG.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired an equity interest in Your Family Entertainment AG (\u201cYFE\u201d). We are exposed to risk of the success of the YFE business. We are also exposed to risk of adverse reactions to the transaction or changes to business relationships; competitive responses; inability to maintain key personnel and changes in general economic conditions in Germany. If YFE fails to perform to our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe operate internationally, which exposes us to significant risks.\nWe have expanded into international operations, including the acquisition of ChizComm, our pending acquisition of WOW and our investment in YFE. As part of our growth strategy, we will continue to evaluate potential opportunities for further international expansion. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention, and subjects us to legal, regulatory, economic and political risks in addition to those we face in the United States. We have limited experience with international operations, and further international expansion efforts may not be successful.\nIn addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u00b7 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our products outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u00b7 Currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars;\n\u00b7 Restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u00b7 Difficulties in managing and staffing international operations, including difficulties related to the increased operations, travel, infrastructure, employee attrition and legal compliance costs associated with numerous international locations;\n\u00b7 Our ability to effectively price our products in competitive international markets;\n\u00b7 New and different sources of competition;\n\u00b7 The need to adapt and localize our products for specific countries;\n\u00b7 Challenges in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 International trade policies, tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas;\n\u00b7 The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military actions involving Russia and Ukraine; and\n\u00b7 Adverse consequences relating to the complexity of operating in multiple international jurisdictions with different laws, regulations and case law which are subject to interpretation by taxpayers, including us.\nIn addition, due to potential costs from our international expansion efforts outside of the United States, our gross margin for international customers may be lower than our gross margin for domestic customers. As a result, our overall gross margin may fluctuate as we further expand our operations and customer base internationally.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nBecause we conduct a growing portion of our business outside the United States but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Our foreign operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income (or loss). If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, however, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenue, operating expenses and net income (or loss). As exchange rates vary, sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. We continue to review potential hedging strategies that may reduce the effect of fluctuating currency rates on our business, but there can be no assurances that we will implement such a hedging strategy or that once implemented, such a strategy would accomplish our objectives or not result in losses.\nA decrease in the fair values of our reporting units may result in future goodwill impairments.\nWhen we acquire an entity, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill at least annually based upon the fair value of the reporting unit to which such goodwill relates, including the determination of expected future cash flows and/or profitability of such reporting units, and we take into account market value multiples and/or cash flows of entities that we deem to be comparable in nature, scope or size to our reporting units. A goodwill impairment is created if the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units decreases, causing the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit - which includes the value of the assigned goodwill - to exceed the fair value of such net assets. If we determine such an impairment exists, we adjust the carrying value of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit by the amount of fair value in excess of the carrying value. The impairment charge is recorded in our income statement in the period in which the impairment is determined. If we are required in the future to record additional goodwill impairments, our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected. In connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill, the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and assumptions, and actual results may ultimately be materially different from such estimates and assumptions.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be subject to substantial volatility, and stockholders may lose all or a substantial part of their investment.\nOur common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. There is limited public float, and trading volume historically has been low and sporadic. As a result, the market price for our common stock may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of our fair market value. The price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of shares available for sale in the market, quarterly variations in our operating results, actual or anticipated announcements of new releases by us or competitors, the gain or loss of significant customers, changes in the estimates of our operating performance, market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market, such as minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nOn March 4, 2022, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share (\u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock, and our common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cGNUS\u201d at this time.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until August 31, 2022, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Compliance will be achieved automatically and without further action when the closing bid price of our common stock is at or above $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day compliance period, in which case Nasdaq will notify us of our compliance and the matter will be closed.\nIf, however, we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by August 31, 2022, we may be eligible for additional time to comply. In order to be eligible for such additional time, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and we must notify Nasdaq in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. There can be no guarantee that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, that we will maintain compliance with other Nasdaq Listing Rules, or that we will be eligible for a second compliance period.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The OTC Bulletin Board does not meet such requirements and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00 and our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange such as Nasdaq, our stock may be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, at least two business days prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver to the customer a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information and to obtain from the customer a signed and date acknowledgment of receipt of that document. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive: (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In addition, we are not subject to auditor attestation of internal controls which may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely impact the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Any additional preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. Our current intention is to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock, and in any event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because the return on investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and, in anticipation of which, the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a non-affiliated person who has held restricted shares of our common stock for a period of six months may sell into the market all of their shares, subject to us being current in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 285,646,247 shares of common stock of the 303,379,122 shares of common stock issued and outstanding are free trading. As of the same date, there are 5,406,465 shares of common stock underlying outstanding warrants that could be sold pursuant to Rule 144 to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements as well as 40,105,500 shares of common stock underlying registered warrants. Lastly, as of December 31, 2021, there are 10,197,312 shares of common stock underlying outstanding options granted, 17,488,177 shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and 4,482,178 shares reserved for issuance under our Genius Brands International, Inc. 2020 Incentive Plan.", "PERMNO": 16463, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "GNUS"}
