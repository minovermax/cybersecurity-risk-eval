RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects and to make decisions based on our historical performance.\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business on the basis of historical operations. As a consequence, it is difficult to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Reliance on our historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve. Because of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales, product costs or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could incur greater losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price.\nFor our operating entities in PRC, from the inception to December 31, 2014, we have incurred accumulated net loss in the amount of approximately USD7.93 million and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nFrom our PRC operating entities\u2019 inception to December 31, 2014 we have incurred accumulated net loss in the amount of approximately USD7.93 million, including net losses in the amount of USD3,211,364 and USD3,092,587 in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to at the early stage of development of our business.\nOur operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors set forth below could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations:\n(i) Lower customer traffic or average value per transaction, which negatively impacts comparable club sales, net revenues, operating income, operating margins and earnings per share, due to:\n\u2022 the impact of initiatives by competitors and increased competition generally;\n\u2022 customers trading down to lower priced services within our spas, and/or shifting to competitors with lower priced services;\n\u2022 lack of customer acceptance of new services or price increases necessary to cover costs of new services and/or higher input costs;\n\u2022 the attractiveness of the venues to consumers and competition from comparable venues in terms of, among other things, accessibility and cost;\n\u2022 declines in general consumer demand for specialty services;\n(ii) Cost increases that are either wholly or partially beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022 labor costs such as general market wage levels;\n\u2022 litigation against us;\n\u2022 construction costs associated with new club openings; or\n\u2022 information technology costs and other logistical resources necessary to maintain and support the growth of our business.\nTherefore, due to the factors mentioned above as well as our historical losses, although we expect our net loss to decrease as a percentage of our total net revenues in the foreseeable future, we may continue to incur net losses in the future. We may also continue to incur net losses in the future due to changes in the macroeconomic and regulatory environment, competitive dynamics and our inability to respond to these changes in a timely and effective manner.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in Risk Factors and the following factors may affect our operating results:\n\u2022 Our ability to continue to attract customers to our clubs;\n\u2022 Our ability to generate revenue from our members and customers for the services and products we offer;\n\u2022 The amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations and infrastructure; and\n\u2022 Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results.\nWe may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to drive long-term shareholder value and improve our company\u2019s results of operations.\nEconomic conditions in the PRC market could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAs a leisure service provider that is dependent upon discretionary consumer spending, the results of our operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and falling home prices. Any resulting decreases in customer traffic or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis.\nLiability for Service-related injuries and other potential claims could adversely affect us.\nThe nature and use of services and the products we use to provide our services could give rise to liability for service-related injuries and other claims if a customer were injured while receiving one of our services (including those performed by students at our schools) or were to suffer adverse reactions following the service. Adverse reactions could be caused by various factors beyond our control, including hypoallergenic sensitivity with the products we use. Although service-related injuries lawsuits in the PRC are rare, and we have not, to date, incurred litigation expense involving service-related injuries, there is no guarantee that we will not face such liability in the future. As we do not carry insurance to help cover the costs of any such litigation or any judgments against us, such liability could be substantial and the occurrence of such loss or liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brand.\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation for the quality of our massage services, and for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions as to a variety of subjective qualities. Even isolated business incidents that erode consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value. Consumer demand for our services and brand equity could diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the quality of our massage services, or are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets.\nEffectively managing our growth into new geographic areas will be challenging.\nEffectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets geographically where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with the our goals, philosophy and standards. Growth can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees to meet our financial targets, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, and to train employees nationally to deliver a consistently high quality service and customer experience.\nWe face risks related to maintaining our computer networks.\nOur business relies to a significant extent on our computer networks, which control our point-of-sale system, which monitors our sales on a real-time basis. These networks may be vulnerable to service interruptions, delays or failures, including those related to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security threats. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, resulting adversely on our operations and financial condition. Any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face difficulties in protecting our intellectual property.\nWe have \u201cKangjiafu\u201d trademarks registered in the PRC by licensing from KJF Biotech, a related party (please refer to the section entitled \u201cIntellectual Property Rights\u201d in this Current Report). Although these intellectual properties are protected through registration, enforcement of measures for the protection of intellectual property rights in the PRC is currently not as certain or effective as compared to some developed countries. We believe our trademarks are critical to our success and that the success of our business depends in part upon our continued ability to use or further develop and increase brand awareness. The infringement of our trademarks would diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, as well as our competitive advantages.\nMonitoring and preventing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. The measures we take to protect our brand, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent their unauthorized use by third parties. Furthermore, application of laws governing intellectual property rights in the PRC and abroad is uncertain and evolving and could involve substantial risks to us. If we are unable to adequately protect our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, we may lose these rights and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, including massage instructors, club managers and massage therapists. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to train new employees, and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nThe loss of key executives or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified executives could jeopardize our ability to meet financial targets.\nOur success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives, consisting of Mr. Yazhong Liao, CEO and President. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate key executives to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A loss of a key executive could jeopardize our ability to meet financial targets.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan and fund operations and may not be able to obtain such capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nCapital requirements are difficult to plan in our rapidly changing industry. Although we currently expect to have sufficient funding for the next 12 months, we expect that we will need additional capital to fund our future expansion efforts.\nWe may be required to pursue sources of additional capital through various means, including debt or equity financings. There is no assurance that we will be successful in locating a suitable financing transaction in a timely fashion or at all.\nIf we cannot raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to carry out all or parts of our strategy to maintain our growth and competitiveness or to fund our operations. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required to cease operations.\nOur future performance is dependent on the PRC economy and, in particular, the level of growth of the PRC consumer market.\nWe derive substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our massage services in the PRC. The success of our business depends on the condition and growth of the PRC consumer market, which in turn depends on macro-economic conditions and individual income levels in the PRC. There is no assurance that projected growth rates of the PRC economy and the PRC consumer market will be realized under current economic situation. Any future slowdowns or declines in the PRC economy or consumer spending may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPolitical, economic and social policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could affect our business and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth.\nThe economy of the PRC differs from the economies of most developed countries in a number of respects, including:\n\u2022 its structure;\n\u2022 level of government involvement;\n\u2022 level of development;\n\u2022 level of capital reinvestment;\n\u2022 control of capital reinvestment;\n\u2022 control of foreign exchange; and\n\u2022 allocation of resources.\nBefore its adoption of reform and open-door policies beginning in 1978, China was primarily a planned economy. Since then, the PRC government has been reforming the PRC\u2019s economic system, and has begun reforming the government structure in recent years. These reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social progress. Although the PRC government still owns a significant portion of the productive assets in the PRC, economic reform policies since the late 1970s have emphasized autonomous enterprises and the utilization of market mechanisms, especially where these policies apply to privately-owned businesses. Although we believe these reforms will have a positive effect on our overall and long-term development, we cannot predict whether changes in the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies will have an adverse impact on our current or future business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to continue to expand our business is dependent on a number of factors, including general economic, capital market conditions and credit availability from banks or other lenders. In the past few years, the PRC government has articulated a need to control the rate of economic growth and may tighten its monetary policies, including increasing interest rates on bank loans and deposits and tightening the money supply to control growth in lending. Under current economic situation, financial institutions have tightened their lending. Stricter lending policies may, among other things, affect our ability to obtain financing, which may, in turn, adversely affect our growth and financial condition.\nAs we conduct a significant portion of our business through operating entities in China, we are subject to PRC laws and regulations on labor and employee benefits. In recent years, the PRC government has implemented policies to strengthen the protection of employees and obligate employers to provide more benefits to their employees. In addition, an employment contract law came into effect in China on January 1, 2008. The PRC employment contract law and related legislations require more benefits to be provided to employees, such as an increase in pay or compensation for termination of employment contracts. As a result, we expect to incur higher labor costs, which could have an adverse impact on our current or future business, results of operations or financial condition. Additional changes in the PRC\u2019s political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA failure by the beneficial owners of our shares who are PRC residents to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our ability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and subject us to liability under PRC law.\nThe SAFE has promulgated regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, effective on July 14, 2014, and its appendixes, that require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of the SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in their ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion.\nThese regulations apply to our direct and indirect shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions or share transfers that we make in the future if our shares are issued to PRC residents. If there exists any PRC residents beneficially holding interests in us without making appropriate registration pursuant to SAFE Circular No. 37, we could be subject to fines and legal penalties, and the SAFE could restrict our cross-border investment activities and our foreign exchange activities.\nOur revenues are denominated in RMB, which is not freely convertible for capital account transactions and may be subject to exchange rate volatility.\nWe are exposed to the risks associated with foreign exchange controls and restrictions in China, as our revenues are denominated in RMB, which is currently not freely exchangeable. The PRC government imposes control over the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies. Under the rules promulgated under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and operation-related expenditures, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval but are subject to procedural requirements. Strict foreign exchange control continues to apply to capital account transactions. These transactions must be approved by or registered with the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange and repayment of loan principal, distribution of return on direct capital investment and investments in negotiable instruments are also subject to restrictions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet all of our foreign currency obligations or to remit profits out of China.\nFluctuation in the value of the RMB and of the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nAny significant revaluation of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition, as well as on the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ordinary shares in foreign currency terms. For instance, a decline in the value of RMB against the U.S. dollar could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results, the value of your investment in us and the dividends we may pay in the future, if any.\nThere remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to liberalize further its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. The RMB may be revalued further against the U.S. dollar or other currencies, or may be permitted to enter into a full or limited free float, which may result in an appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar or other currencies.\nWe rely principally on dividends paid by entities under our control to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC operating entities to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nThe registrant is a Nevada company, which relies principally on dividends paid by its subsidiaries for cash requirements, including the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur. If any of our subsidiaries or operating entities incur debt in their own name in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict dividends or other distributions on its equity interest to us.\nFurthermore, applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations permit payment of dividends by the consolidated PRC entities only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards, which differ in many aspects from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in other jurisdictions including IFRS. Based on PRC accounting standards, the consolidated PRC entities are also required to set aside a certain percentage of their after-tax profit each year to their reserve fund in accordance with the requirements of relevant laws and provisions in their respective articles of associations, which are not available for distribution as cash dividends. As a result, the consolidated PRC entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net income to the registrant whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Any limitation on the ability of our operating entities to pay dividends could materially adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and implementation regulations issued by the State Council, PRC income tax at the rate of 10%, unless relevant treaties provide for a lower rate, is applicable to dividends paid by enterprises incorporated in the PRC to \u201cnon-resident enterprises\u201d (enterprises that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business) subject to the application of any relevant income tax treaty that the PRC has entered into. If the registrant or our non-PRC incorporated subsidiaries are considered \u201cnonresident enterprises,\u201d any dividend that registrant or any such subsidiary receives from the PRC operating entities may be subject to PRC taxation at the 10% rate (or lower treaty rate).\nAny changes in PRC policies on enterprise income tax may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and our financial condition.\nOn March 16, 2007, the new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the \u201cnew tax law\u201d) was issued and on December 6, 2007, the Rules on the Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (\u201cImplementation Rules\u201d) were issued, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the new tax law, non-PRC tax resident enterprises will be taxed at a withholding tax rate of 10% for British Virgin Islands companies. If an entity is deemed to be a PRC tax resident enterprise, which is an enterprise that is set up under PRC law within the territory of the PRC, or set up under the law of a foreign country or region but which has \u201cde facto management organization\u201d within the PRC, then qualified dividend and profit distribution from equity investment between them shall be exempted from withholding tax and income tax. Among other things, qualified dividend and profit distribution as stated in the new tax law shall refer to investment income derived by a PRC tax resident enterprise from the direct investment in other PRC tax resident enterprises, which shall exclude investment income from circulating stock issued publicly by PRC tax resident enterprises and traded on stock exchanges where the holding period is less than 12 months.\nOur subsidiaries or PRC operating entities may trigger withholding tax requirements in the future under the new tax law and the Implementation Rules, depending on their classification as a PRC or non-PRC tax resident enterprise. The new tax law provides that if an enterprise incorporated outside of the PRC has \u201cde facto management organization\u201d within the PRC, it may be recognized as a PRC tax resident enterprise and may be subject to a 25% enterprise income tax on its worldwide income. According to the Implementation Rules, \u201cde facto management organization\u201d means the institution that materially and comprehensively manages and controls the enterprise\u2019s business, personnel, finance and assets. Given the short history of the new tax law and the Implementation Rules, how an enterprise qualifies for tax exemptions remains unclear. Our ability to pay dividends and our financial condition may be adversely affected as a result of the new tax law and other changes in PRC policies and regulations on dividend distributions, withholding tax, and enterprise income tax.\nAs all of our management is currently substantially based in the PRC, we may be treated as a PRC resident enterprise for new tax law purposes. The tax consequences of such treatment are currently unclear as they will depend on the implementation regulations and on how local tax authorities apply or enforce the new tax law or the implementation regulations.\nThe levy and collection of enterprise income tax in the PRC are handled by various local governments, which in turn submit such tax revenues to their respective higher administrative authorities. Each local government has its own administrative practice with regard to the manner and the amount of tax submitted by the local government to its higher administrative authorities. PRC enterprises, including us, have no participation in or control over such administrative practices. Any discrepancies in implementation among the local governments of such administrative practice may result in uncertainties over the amount of tax for which a PRC enterprise is liable.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company will be expensive and time consuming.\nPrior to the closing of the transactions contemplated under the VIE Agreements, our predecessor, as a company without operations, and Wuxi KJF, as a PRC private company, have maintained relatively small finance and accounting staffs. Although we maintained disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as required under the federal securities laws with respect to its very limited activities, it was not required to maintain and establish these disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls as will be required now that we have substantial operations. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we will need to implement additional corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these obligations will require significant management time, place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial, accounting and information systems, and increase our insurance, legal and financial compliance costs. We may also need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nOur failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.\nCompanies operating in China are required to participate in social insurance and housing fund plans. We have not fully contributed to such plans as required by applicable PRC regulations. As of December 31, 2014, with regards to the outstanding contributions, including historical underpayments to such plans, we made a provision of RMB2.42 million (US$0.39 million), which is reflected in our audited financial statements included in this filing. While we believe this provision is adequate, our failure to make sufficient payments to such plans does not fully comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations and we may be required to make up the contributions for such plans as well as to pay late fees and fines.\nOur business will suffer if any necessary license cannot be maintained or renewed.\nAny entity that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work, and Wuxi KJF, Nanjing KJF, and the clubs we operate each hold valid business licenses. While the business licenses of each of Wuxi KJF, Nanjing KJF and the clubs cover their present business purposes, the standards of compliance required in relation thereto may from time to time be subject to change. While Nanjing KJF, Wuxi KJF and the clubs intend to apply for renewal and/or reassessment of such licenses when required by applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our licenses or accomplish the reassessment of such licenses in a timely manner. Any changes in compliance standards, or any new laws or regulations that may prohibit or render it more restrictive for us to conduct business or increase compliance costs may adversely affect our operations or profitability. In addition, Nanjing KJF, Wuxi KJF and the spas we operate may not be able to carry on business without such licenses being renewed and/or reassessed.\nIn accordance with the Regulation of Fire Protection and safety management in Public Entertainment Places, and Fire Protection Law, an Opinion on Fire Protection Inspection (\u201cFire Opinion\u201d) shall be obtained prior to the operation of a public entertainment place. Failure to comply with such requirement could impose penalties, including suspensions or shutdown of the business. Our operating entity, Wuxi KJF, operates a public entertainment place without a Fire Opinion due to the local practice, if the authority determines that Wuxi KJF violates such requirement as mentioned above, Wuxi KJF may not be able to carry on business continually.\nOur contractual arrangements with Wuxi KJF and the Wuxi KJF Shareholders may not be as effective in providing control as direct ownership.\nOur contractual arrangements with Wuxi KJF and the Wuxi KJF Shareholders provide us with effective control over Wuxi KJF. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the economic benefits of ownership of Wuxi KJF, and we consolidate the results of operations, assets and liabilities of Wuxi KJF in our financial statements. However, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Wuxi KJF as direct equity ownership of Wuxi KJF. If Wuxi KJF or the Wuxi KJF Shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements and rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective.\nIf the PRC government determines that the contractual arrangements through which we control Wuxi KJF do not comply with applicable regulations, our business could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we believe our contractual relationships through which we control Wuxi KJF comply with current licensing and regulatory requirements of the PRC, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree, or that new and burdensome regulations will not be adopted in the future. If the PRC government determines that our structure or operating arrangements do not comply with applicable law, it could revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our customers, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business.\nWe haven\u2019t completed registration for our existing equity pledges, which may adversely affect our ability to control our operating affiliates.\nThe PRC Property Rights Law, which was promulgated on March 16, 2007 and became effective on October 1, 2007, requires registration with the local Administration of Industry and Commerce (the \u201cAIC\u201d) in order to create a security interest over an equity interest in a PRC company. Therefore, before the equity pledge is duly registered with the local AIC, the equity pledge is unenforceable even though the relevant equity pledge agreement is still binding. We submitted registration for our existing equity pledges with the local AIC on April 21, 2014., however, there is no assurance that we can have these equity pledges registration completed by the local AIC in a timely manner or at all. Considering that we have not completed registration for these existing equity pledges with the local AIC, any equity pledges created under these equity pledge agreements may be considered unenforceable. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our operating affiliates, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected.\nIf the custodians or authorized users of our controlling non-tangible assets, including corporate chops and seals fail to fulfill their responsibilities, or misappropriate or misuse these assets, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder PRC law, legal documents for corporate transactions, including contracts that our business relies on, are executed using the chops or seal of the signing entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is registered and filed with AIC.\nCurrently, the designated legal representative of our PRC operating entity is Mr. Yazhong Liao, the Company\u2019s CEO and President. Accordingly, there is a risk that the registered legal representative of our PRC operating entity could abuse his authority, for example, by binding the Company with contracts against the Company\u2019s interest or intentions which could result in economic harm or damages as a result of any contractual obligations, or resulting disputes that might arise. If the party contracting with the Company did not act in good faith under such circumstances, then we could incur costs to nullify such contracts.\nWe rely on the Company seals, financial chops and business licenses of our PRC entity for entering into contracts, conducting banking business, or taking official corporate action of any sort including registering any change to the composition of the board of directors or management with the relevant PRC authorities. In order to maintain the physical security of our chops, seals and business licenses and other controlling intangible assets, we generally store these items in secured locations accessible only by the authorized personnel in the local administrative and finance departments. Although we monitor such authorized personnel in the local administrative and finance departments, there is no assurance such procedures may be able to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence. Accordingly, if any of our authorized personnel in the local administrative and finance departments obtain and misuse or misappropriate our corporate chops, seals, business licenses or other controlling intangible assets, we could incur economic damage and disruption to our operations that may necessitate corporate or legal action. Such corporate or legal action could involve significant time and resources to resolve while distracting management from our operations. In particular, during any period were we lose effective control of the corporate activities as a result of such misuse or misappropriation, the business activities of the affected entity could be disrupted and we could lose the economic benefits of that aspect of our business which may negatively impact our business and reputation.\nThe shareholders of Wuxi KJF may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe major shareholders of Wuxi KJF are Yazhong Liao, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Zhangmei Zhang and Huiwen Qu. Conflicts of interest between their role as shareholders of Wuxi KJF and their duties to us may arise. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, these individuals will act in our best interests, or that conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. In addition, these individuals may breach or cause Wuxi KJF to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements that allow us to effectively control Wuxi KJF and receive economic benefits from them. Currently, we do not have arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these individuals and our company, and a conflict could result in these individuals as officers of our company violating fiduciary duties to us. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and the shareholders of Wuxi KJF, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business, and there would be substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nContractual arrangements we have entered into may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities, and a finding that we, or our affiliated entities, owe additional taxes that could reduce our net income and the value of your investment.\nAs required by applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. We could face adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements between Nanjing KJF and Wuxi KJF do not represent an arm\u2019s-length price and adjust Wuxi KJF\u2019s income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction for PRC tax purposes of expense deductions recorded by Wuxi KJF, which could in turn increase its respective tax liabilities. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on our affiliated entities for underpaid taxes. Our net income may be adversely affected if Wuxi KJF\u2019s tax liabilities increase or if it is found to be subject to late payment fees or other penalties.\nCurrency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business, including limiting our ability to convert Chinese RMB into foreign currencies and, if Chinese RMB were to decline in value, reducing our revenue in U.S. dollar terms.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and our operations in the PRC use their local currency as their functional currencies. Substantially all of our revenue and expenses are in Chinese RMB. We are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any of these currencies. For example, the value of the RMB depends to a large extent on PRC government policies and the PRC\u2019s domestic and international economic and political developments, as well as supply and demand in the local market. Since 1994, the official exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to the U.S. dollar had generally been stable and the RMB had appreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar. However, on July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of Chinese RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, Chinese RMB may fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. It is difficult to predict when and how RMB exchange rates may change going forward.\nThe income statements of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and operating entities into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 or operating entities\u2019 financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In addition, we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity\u2019s functional currency. Changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss. We have not entered into agreements or purchased instruments to hedge its exchange rate risks, although it may do so in the future. The availability and effectiveness of any hedging transaction may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge its exchange rate risks.\nAlthough PRC governmental policies were introduced in 1996 to allow the convertibility of Chinese RMB into foreign currency for current account items, conversion of Chinese RMB into foreign exchange for capital items, such as foreign direct investment, loans or securities, requires the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which is under the authority of the People\u2019s Bank of China. These approvals, however, do not guarantee the availability of foreign currency conversion. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain all required conversion approvals for our operations or that PRC regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of Chinese RMB in the future. Because a significant amount of our future revenue will be in the form of Chinese RMB, our inability to obtain the requisite approvals or any future restrictions on currency exchanges could limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Chinese RMB to fund our business activities outside of the PRC, or to repay foreign currency obligations, including our debt obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have limited legal recourse under PRC law if disputes arise under our contracts with third parties.\nThe PRC government has enacted some laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is limited, and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. If business ventures are unsuccessful, we face the risk that the parties to these ventures may seek ways to terminate the transactions, or, may hinder or prevent us from accessing important information regarding the financial and business operations of these acquired companies. The resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the PRC government, and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights we may have to specific performance or to seek an injunction under PRC law are severely limited in either of these cases. Without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nOur holding company are organized under the laws of Hong Kong and most of our assets are located outside of the United States. Most of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts (imposing monetary fines, penalties, damages or otherwise) or entertain original actions brought in the courts of the PRC against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not recognize or enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers (imposing monetary fines, penalties, damages or otherwise) or entertain original actions brought in the courts of the PRC against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or the public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would recognize or enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and PRC Anti-Bribery Law, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. We are also subject to the PRC Anti-Bribery Law, which strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business, or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.\nCertain PRC government approvals may be required under regulations adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval.\nIn 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies jointly adopted the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule. This rule requires that if an overseas company is established or controlled by PRC domestic companies or citizens intends to acquire equity interests or assets of any other PRC domestic company affiliated with the PRC domestic companies or citizens, such acquisition must be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce, rather than local regulators, for approval. In addition, this regulation requires that an overseas company controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or citizens and holding equity interests of PRC domestic companies needs to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, prior to listing its securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying the documents and materials required to be submitted by overseas special purpose companies seeking CSRC\u2019s approval of their overseas listings.\nWhile the application of the M&A Rule remains unclear, based on their understanding of current PRC laws, regulations, and the notice published on September 21, 2006, since our operating entities were established by means of direct investment, rather than by merger or acquisition of the equity interest or assets of any \u201cdomestic company\u201d as defined under the M&A Rules, and no provision in the M&A Rules classifies our contractual arrangements with Wuxi KJF as a type of acquisition transaction falling under the M&A Rules, we are not required to submit an application to the Ministry of Commerce or the CSRC for its approval for our contractual control of Wuxi KJF or any of our transactions.\nIf the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that the approvals from the Ministry of Commerce and/or CSRC were required, our contractual control over the PRC business could be challenged and we may need to apply for a remedial approval and may be subject to certain administrative punishments or other sanctions from PRC regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of our foreign currency in our offshore bank accounts into the PRC, or take other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nThe M&A Rule sets forth complex procedures for acquisitions conducted by foreign investors that could make it more difficult to pursue acquisitions.\nThe M&A Rule sets forth complex procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. Complying with the requirements of the M&A Rule to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nInsiders have substantial control over us, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control even if our other shareholders wanted it to occur.\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders hold approximately a large majority of our outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, these shareholders are able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other shareholders wanted it to occur.\nWe are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we determine to pay dividends in the future, our ability to do so will depend upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our PRC-based contractually controlled entity may, from time to time, be subject to restrictions on its ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock will become liquid or that they will be listed on a securities exchange.\nUntil our ordinary shares are listed on an exchange, or are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or in the \u201cpink sheets,\u201d we expect that our common stock will remain non-tradable. In those venues, however, an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our ordinary shares. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our ordinary shares to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our ordinary shares, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nIn order to raise sufficient funds to expand our operations, we may have to issue additional securities at prices that may result in substantial dilution to our shareholders.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt, our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our securities outstanding. We may have to issue securities that may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our ordinary shares. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our future needs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business plans, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we may be required to annually furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report may have to contain, among other matters, an assessment by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of our fiscal year. Any such assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. In addition, under current SEC rules, we will be required to obtain an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm as to our internal control over financial reporting for our annual report on Form 10-K covering our next fiscal year. Performing the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is both costly and challenging. During the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares.\nCompliance with rules and requirements applicable to public companies will cause us to incur additional costs, and any failure by us to comply with such rules and requirements could negatively affect investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, many of which are not reflected in our historical financial statements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the SEC and the securities exchanges, such as the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and NYSE AMEX, have required changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and to make certain corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. Complying with these rules and requirements may be especially difficult and costly for us because we may have difficulty locating sufficient personnel in China with experience and expertise relating to U.S. GAAP and United States public company reporting requirements, and such personnel may command high salaries. If we cannot employ sufficient personnel to ensure compliance with these rules and regulations, we may need to rely more on outside legal, accounting and financial experts, which may be very costly. In addition, we will incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nWe may be subject to the penny stock rules which will make our securities more difficult to sell.\nIf we are able to obtain a listing of our securities on a national securities exchange, we may be subject in the future to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules if our securities sell below $5.00 per share. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for our securities. As long as our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such securities may find it more difficult to sell their securities.", "PERMNO": 18711, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "KJFI"}
