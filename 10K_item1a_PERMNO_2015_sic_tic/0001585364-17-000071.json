{"cik": "1585364", "company": "PERRIGO Co plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-05-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Operations\nWe face vigorous competition from other pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies that may threaten the commercial acceptance and pricing of our products.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete against store brand, generic, and branded pharmaceutical companies. Competition is also impacted by changes in regulations and government pricing programs that may give competitors an advantage.\n\u2022\nAs a manufacturer of generic versions of brand-name drugs through our CHCA and RX segments, we experience competition from brand-name drug companies that may try to prevent, discourage or delay the use of generic versions through various measures, including introduction of new branded products, legislative initiatives, changing dosage forms or dosing regimens, regulatory processes, filing new patents or patent extensions, lawsuits, citizens\u2019 petitions, and negative publicity prior to introduction of a generic product. In addition, brand-name competitors may lower their prices to compete with generic products, increase advertising, or launch, either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company, an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched, depriving the generic product potential market exclusivity.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOur CHCA and RX segments also experience competition from our generic competitors, some of whom are significantly larger than we are, who may develop their products more rapidly or complete regulatory approval processes sooner, or may market their products earlier than we do. In the U.S., if we are not the first to file our ANDA, the FDA may grant 180-day exclusivity to another company, which would prevent us from selling the product during the exclusivity period. Even if we are the first to file, in certain circumstances, we may not be able to fully exploit our 180-day exclusivity period.\n\u2022\nOur CHCA and RX segments may experience increased price competition as other generic companies produce the same product, sometimes for dramatically lower margins in order to gain market share. Other generic companies may introduce new drugs and/or drug delivery techniques that make our current products less desirable. A drug may be subject to competition from alternative therapies during the period of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity, and thereafter we may be subject to further competition from generic products or biosimilars.\n\u2022\nThe pharmaceutical industry is consolidating. This creates larger competitors and places further pressure on prices, development activities, and customer retention. Our animal health category within the CHCA segment has seen an increase in direct to consumer advertising by several branded competitors, which may increase in the future, and our nutritionals category has experienced increased competition through alternative channels such as health food stores, direct mail, and direct sales.\n\u2022\nWe develop and distribute branded products primarily through our CHCI segment. We experience competition from other brand-name drug companies, many of which are larger and have more resources to devote to advertising and marketing. These direct competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements. Our current and future competitors may develop products comparable or superior to those offered by us at more competitive prices. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be harmed through loss of customers or increased negative pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market innovative products that meet customer demands, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur continued growth is due in large part to our ability to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer requirements for quality, safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness. Continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to our business. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture, and market new products, we could lose market share, and our net sales may be negatively impacted. See Item 1. Business - Research and Development for more information.\n\u2022\nWe maintain a diversified product line to function as a primary supplier for our customers. Capital investments are driven by growth, technological advancements, cost improvement and the need for manufacturing flexibility. Our future capital expenditures could vary materially due to the uncertainty of these factors. In addition, if we fail to stay current with the latest manufacturing, information and packaging technology, we may be unable to competitively support the launch of new product introductions.\n\u2022\nOur product margins may decline over time due to our products' aging life cycles, changes in consumer choice, changes in competition for our existing products, or the introduction of next generation innovative products; therefore, new product introductions are necessary to maintain our current financial condition. If we are unable to continue to create new products, we may lose market share or experience pricing pressure, and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWe must prove that the regulated generic drug products in our CHCA and RX segments are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts, which requires bioequivalence studies, and in the case of topical products, even more extensive clinical endpoint trials to demonstrate their efficacy. The development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to innovative products, is both time consuming and costly, and subject to a high degree of business risk. Products currently under development may require re-design to meet evolving FDA standards, may not perform as expected, may not pass required bioequivalence studies, or may be the subject of intellectual property challenges. Necessary regulatory\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\napprovals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all. Any of these events may negatively impact our net sales.\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain scientists proficient in emerging delivery forms and/or contracting with a third party in order to generate new products of this type is critical to our long-term plans. If we fail to attract and retain this talent, our long-term sales growth and profit could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nEven upon the successful development of a product, our customers' failure to launch a product successfully, or delays in manufacturing, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the FDA or similar regulatory agency could impose higher standards and additional requirements, such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required, in order to gain regulatory clearance to launch new formulations into the market, which could negatively impact our future net sales.\nOur CHCA and CHCI segments are impacted by changes in consumer preferences. If we are unable to adapt to these changes, we may lose market share and our net sales may be negatively impacted.\nWhile the market for store brand products has grown in recent years, there can be no assurance that the pace of this growth will continue. Consumer preferences related to health and nutritional concerns may change, which could negatively impact demand for our CHCA and CHCI products or cause us to incur additional costs to change our products or product packaging.\n\u2022\nThe future growth and stability of U.S. store brand market share will be impacted, in part, by general economic conditions, which can influence consumers to switch to and from store brand products. Our CHCA segment sales could be negatively affected if economic conditions improve and consumers return to purchasing higher-priced brand-name products. Conversely, while store brand products present an alternative to higher-priced branded products, if economic conditions deteriorate, our CHCA segment sales could be negatively impacted if consumers forgo obtaining healthcare or reduce their healthcare spending.\n\u2022\nOur CHCI segment's success is dependent on the continued growth in demand for its lifestyle products, which include weight-loss products and various dietary supplements. If demand for these products decreases, our CHCI segment's results of operations would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nOur CHCA customers may request changes in packaging to meet consumer demands, which could cause us to incur inventory obsolescence charges and redesign costs, which in turn would negatively impact our CHCA segment's results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula product category within our CHCA segment is subject to changing consumer preferences and health and nutrition-related concerns. Our business depends, in part, on consumer preferences and choices, including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies. To the extent that private, public, and government sources may promote the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula, there could be a reduced demand for infant formula products. We could also be adversely impacted by an increase in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the U.S. federal government through the Women, Infants and Children program, as we do not participate in this program.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and any inability to timely meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nWe are subject to the regulations of a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. agencies related to the manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distribution, advertising, and sale of our products as described in detail in Item 1. Business - Government Regulation and Pricing. Government regulation in the markets in which we operate could impact our business, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations or policies. Below are some of the ways in which government regulation could impact our business and/or financial results:\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nWe must obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agencies in order to manufacture and sell our products in the regions in which we operate. Obtaining this approval can be time consuming and costly. There can be no assurance that, in the event we submit an application for a marketing authorization to any global regulatory agency, we will obtain the approval to market a product and/or that we will obtain it on a timely basis. Laws unique to the U.S. regulatory framework encourage generic competition by providing eligibility for first generic marketing exclusivity if certain conditions are met. If we are granted generic exclusivity, the exclusivity may be shared with other generic companies, including authorized generics; or it is possible that we may forfeit 180-day exclusivity if we do not obtain regulatory approval or begin marketing the product within the statutory requirements. Finally, if we are not the first to file our ANDA, the FDA may grant 180-day exclusivity to another company, thereby effectively delaying the launch of our product.\n\u2022\nGlobal regulatory agencies regularly inspect our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our third-party suppliers. The failure of one of our facilities, or a facility of one of our third-party suppliers, to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to a breach of representations made to our customers, or to regulatory or government action against us related to the products made in that facility. Such action could include suspension of or delay in regulatory approvals. If the compliance violations are severe, agencies of the government may initiate product seizure, injunction, recall, suspension of production or distribution of our products, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, or civil or criminal prosecution, thereby impacting the reputation of all of our products.\n\u2022\nIn the U.S., the DSCSA requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period beginning on January 1, 2015, for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. Similarly, the European Commission passed legislation requiring new product packaging \u2018safety features\u2019 to prevent falsification of medicinal products primarily within the prescription medicines sector. The act was adopted February 9, 2016. EU member states (with the exception of Belgium, Italy and Greece), and EEA members Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland must be in compliance within three years, or by February 9, 2019. Belgium, Italy, and Greece have until February 9, 2025 to comply. Marketing Authorization holders will have three years from the publication date to implement the necessary changes or risk forfeiting their product licenses. Compliance with the new U.S. and EU electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.\n\u2022\nGlobal regulatory agencies highly scrutinize any product application submitted to switch a product from physician prescribed Rx to unsupervised OTC use by the general public. The expansion of Rx-to-OTC switches is critical to our future growth. Reluctance of regulatory agencies to approve Rx-to-OTC switches in new product categories could impact that growth.\n\u2022\nSeveral bills have been introduced in U.S. Congress that could, if enacted, affect the manufacture and marketing of Rx and OTC drugs including labeling and packaging. For example, the FDA is proposing to change existing regulations to permit generic drug application holders to revise their labeling without prior FDA review to add new safety information that may differ from the corresponding brand drug. The FDA has delayed publication of the Final Rule until April 2017. If this proposed regulatory change is adopted without further revision, it may eliminate the preemption of certain failure-to-warn claims, with respect to generic drugs, which could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results. Regulatory bodies outside of the U.S. could enact similar legislation. We cannot predict whether further label restrictions may be required, or whether additional regulations in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate, may be passed.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula products may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the specific content of infant formula products. Governments could enhance regulations on the industry aimed at ensuring the safety and quality of dairy products, including, but not limited to, compulsory batch-by-batch inspection and testing for additional safety and quality issues. Such inspections and testing may increase our operating costs related to infant formula products.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nOn June 10, 2014, the FDA published a final rule (\"FR\") entitled \"Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Control Procedures, Quality Factors, Notification Requirements, and Records and Reports, for Infant Formula.\" The FR includes, among other things, new or modified requirements related to infant formula manufacturing, quality controls, record-keeping, and clinical trials. Our infant formula manufacturing facilities have been inspected by the FDA after the effective date of the FR and found to be in full compliance with the new GMP regulations with no corrective actions required\n\u2022\nSome of our pharmaceutical products are marketed through direct interactions with healthcare professionals, which is known as \u201cdetailing.\u201d This activity is subject to extensive regulation under a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, anti-bribery, and false claims laws; the FFDCA with respect to claims and off-label promotions; and similar laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If our marketing activities are found to be improper, we could be subject to civil and governmental actions and penalties. These risks may increase as non-U.S. jurisdictions adopt new anti-bribery laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain the necessary quota for controlled substances and List I chemicals, we risk having delayed product launches or failing to meet commercial supply obligations. If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements for controlled substances and List I chemicals, the DEA, or similar regulatory agency, may take regulatory actions, resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution of our products, withdrawal of our products from the market, or other penalties.\n\u2022\nChanges to the Medical Device Directive are anticipated in 2017, based on a proposal for new European Medical Device Regulation, which has been under discussion since 2012. These changes are expected to include increased supervision by the Notified Bodies by Competent Authorities and revisions to documentation requirements. We will monitor the regulation's progress and cannot currently predict how it will impact the future production and sale of products classified as medical devices. At this time, work is ongoing to translate the final text of the Regulation in all the EU official languages and to correct technical inconsistencies. Final formal adoption is expected both on the Council and the Parliament sides during the first quarter of 2017.\n\u2022\nOur operations extend to numerous countries outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations, and customs of various jurisdictions. These risks include compliance with a variety of national and local laws of countries in which we do business, such as restrictions on the import and export of certain intermediates, drugs, and technologies. We must also comply with a variety of U.S. laws related to doing business outside of the U.S., including Office of Foreign Asset Controls, United Nations and EU sanctions; the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012; and rules relating to the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Further changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system, including imports, exports, manufacturing, quality, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of healthcare, may affect our business and operations.\nHealthcare reform and related changes to reimbursement methods in and outside of the United States may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing healthcare expenditures have received considerable public attention in many of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers, have been focused on cost containment. In the EU and some other markets outside the U.S., the government provides healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs.\nOur RX segment in particular could be materially adversely impacted by measures taken by governmental entities or private insurers to restrict patients' access to our products or increase pressure on drug pricing, including denial of price increases, prospective and retrospective price decreases, and increased mandatory discounts or rebates. These actions may drive us and our competitors to decrease prices or may reduce the ability of customers to pay for our products, which could materially negatively impact the RX segment's results of operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nSignificant uncertainty exists regarding the effect of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in light of the new U.S. Administration following the recent elections and campaign pledges to repeal or reform the Affordable Care Act. However, if the law is maintained in its current form, it appears likely that it would continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business - Medicaid Drug Rebate Programs, we have a Medicaid rebate agreement and VA master agreement in effect with the U.S. government. There are inherent risks associated with participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program, and the VA FSS program, including the following:\n\u2022\nBy their nature, these programs require us to provide discounts and rebates and therefore reduce our net product revenues. Further, because the amounts of these discounts are based on our commercial sales practices, it is important that we maintain pricing practices that appropriately take into account these government pricing programs.\n\u2022\nWe are required to report pricing data to CMS, including AMP, on a monthly and quarterly basis and BP and ASP on a quarterly basis. We also are required to report quarterly and annual Non-FAMPs to the VA. If we fail to submit required information, make misrepresentations, or knowingly submit false information to the government as to AMP, ASP, or BP, we may be liable for substantial civil monetary penalties or subject to other enforcement actions, such as under the False Claims Act, and CMS may terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement. In that event, U.S. federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\n\u2022\nThe Health Reform Law enacted in 2010 requires the use of AMP data to calculate FULs for multiple source drugs and amends the statutory definitions of AMP and \"multiple source drug\" in a manner that materially affects the calculation of FULs. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis for comparing their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. CMS\u2019s final Medicaid rebate program also directs states to revise their payment methods to establish payment rates consistent with actual acquisition costs. Based on our initial evaluation, we do not believe that the changes will have a material impact on our business. However, states are continuing to evaluate their payment methods and we cannot predict how the new FUL or state payment methodologies will affect our pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers may seek additional discounts in light of reimbursement changes. We also cannot predict how the sharing of FUL data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace.\n\u2022\nUnder the 340B program, if we fail to provide required discounts to covered entities, we may be subject to refund claims or civil money penalties under that program.\n\u2022\nIf we inadvertently overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or TriCare Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in False Claims Act allegations or potential violations of other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responses to a government investigation or enforcement action, are expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n\u2022\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Our calculations and methodologies are subject to review by the governmental agencies, and it is possible that these reviews could result in challenges to our submissions. If we do not comply with those reporting and payment obligations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from U.S. federal healthcare programs (including Medicaid and Medicare).\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nLack of availability, or significant increases in the cost, of raw materials used in manufacturing our products could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results.\nAffordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. In addition, maintaining good supply relationships is essential to our ongoing operations. See Item 1. Business - Materials Sourcing for more information.\n\u2022\nWe maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support, or price considerations. Unavailability or delivery delays of single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related product in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher-volume or more profitable products. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of net sales. Additionally, global regulatory requirements for obtaining product approvals could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate material source. As a result, the loss of a single-source supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces, such as increased energy costs, and our ability or inability to pass on these increases to our customers could have a negative material impact on our financial results.\n\u2022\nOur infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk, such as skim milk powder, whey protein powder, and lactose. Our supply of milk-based ingredients may be limited by the ability of individual dairy farmers and cooperatives to provide raw milk in the amount and quality we deem necessary. Raw milk production is influenced by factors beyond our control including seasonal and environmental factors, governmental agricultural and environmental policy, and global demand. We cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients necessary to produce infant formula.\n\u2022\nOur products, and the raw materials used to make those products, generally have limited shelf lives. Our inventory levels are based, in part, on expectations regarding future sales. We may experience build-ups in inventory if sales slow. Any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products, thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. Cargo thefts and/or diversions, and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering on store shelves may occur, causing unexpected shortages, which may have a material impact on our operations.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties to source many of our raw materials, as well as to manufacture sterile, injectable products that we distribute. We maintain a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients, adulterants, and toxic substances. Nevertheless, discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes, or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith, could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace, either temporarily or permanently. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs and lost revenue, harm our reputation, and may give rise to product liability litigation.\n\u2022\nChanges in regulation could impact the supply of the API and certain other raw materials used in our products. For example, the EU recently promulgated new standards requiring all API imported into the EU be certified as complying with GMP established by the EU. The regulations placed the certification requirement on the regulatory bodies of the exporting countries, which led to an API supply shortage in Europe as certain governments were not willing or able to comply with the regulation in a timely fashion, or at all. A shortage in API or other raw ingredients could cause us to have to cease manufacture of certain products, or to incur costs and delays to qualify other suppliers to substitute for those API manufacturers are unable to export. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nA disruption at any of our main manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations are concentrated in a few locations. See Item 1. Business - Manufacturing and Distribution for more information on our significant operations. A significant disruption at one or more of these facilities, whether it be due to fire, natural disaster, power loss, intentional acts of vandalism, war, terrorism, insufficient quality, or pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, regulatory authorities routinely inspect all of our manufacturing facilities for cGMP compliance. While our manufacturing sites are cGMP compliant, if a regulatory authority were to identify serious adverse findings not corrected upon follow up inspections, we may be required to issue product recalls, shutdown manufacturing facilities, and take other remedial actions. If any manufacturing facility were forced to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected.\nAny breach or disruption of our information systems or cyber security efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur systems, information, and operations, as well as our independent vendor relationships (where they support information technology and manufacturing infrastructure), are highly complex and vulnerable to disruption or damage from security breaches, hacking, data theft, denial of service attacks, human error, sabotage, industrial espionage, and computer viruses. Such events may be difficult to detect; and, once detected, their impact may be difficult to assess. While we continue to employ resources to monitor our systems and protect our infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. These risks include:\n\u2022\nBreaches or disruptions could impair our ability to develop, meet regulatory approval efforts for, produce, and/or ship products, take and fulfill orders, and/or collect and make payments on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nAny system issue, whether as a result of an intentional breach or a natural disaster, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, experience lower sales volume, and incur significant liabilities; and\n\u2022\nWe could incur significant expense in addressing a disruption and related data security and privacy concerns.\nBecause our business depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of our sales, our business would be adversely affected by a disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers' businesses.\nSales to our largest customer, Walmart, comprised approximately 13% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. While no other customer individually comprised more than 10% of net sales, we do have other significant customers. If our relationship with Walmart or any of our other significant customers, including the terms of doing business with the customers, changes significantly, it could have a material adverse impact on us. See Item 1. Business - Significant Customers for more information.\nMany of our customers, which include chain drug stores, wholesalers, distributors, hospital systems, and group purchasing organizations, continue to merge or consolidate. Such consolidation has provided, and may continue to provide, customers with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures we face. The emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. In addition, a number of our customers have instituted sourcing programs limiting the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products carried by that customer. These developments have resulted in heightened pricing pressure on our products, as well as competition among generic drug producers for business from a smaller and more selective customer base.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time, customers may choose to assess penalties, obtain alternate sources for products, and/or end their relationships with us.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nAlthough we have divested our rights to the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream, we are entitled to additional milestone payments if certain specified thresholds are met, and any negative developments related to Tysabri\u00ae could have a material adverse effect on our receipt of those payments.\nWe occasionally enter into arrangements that entitle us to potential royalties from third parties. Our most significant royalty has been the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream received quarterly from Biogen, which generated $353.7 million of cash received during the year ended December 31, 2016. See Item 1. Business - Significant Customers for more information on our Tysabri\u00ae royalty arrangement. On March 27, 2017, we divested our rights to the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream to Royalty Pharma for $2.2 billion in cash at closing and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments if global net sales of Tysabri\u00ae meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Our receipt of these milestone payments may be negatively impacted if the royalty streams decrease and are insufficient to meet the specified thresholds. Factors that may have an adverse effect on the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream include:\n\u2022\nCompanies working to develop new therapies or alternative formulations of products for multiple sclerosis that, if successfully developed, would compete with, or could gain greater acceptance than, Tysabri\u00ae and damage Tysabri\u00ae\u2019s market share. In February 2016, a competitor's pipeline product, Ocrevus\u00ae, received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA, and was approved in 2017. The product is expected to compete with Tysabri\u00ae and have a significant negative impact on the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream;\n\u2022\nBiogen is the owner of the patents on Tysabri\u00ae. The loss of protection of these patents, such as a patent invalidation, could adversely affect the royalty stream from Tysabri\u00ae. In addition, once the Tysabri\u00ae patents expire, other generic companies may introduce products similar to Tysabri\u00ae that could adversely affect the royalty stream;\n\u2022\nForeign currency movement, which could have a negative impact on Biogen's Tysabri\u00ae sales, thereby reducing the royalties;\n\u2022\nAny negative developments relating to Tysabri\u00ae, such as safety, efficacy, or reimbursement issues, could reduce demand for Tysabri\u00ae; and\n\u2022\nAdverse regulatory or legislative developments could limit or prohibit the sale of Tysabri\u00ae, such as restrictions on the use of Tysabri\u00ae or safety-related label changes, including enhanced risk management programs, which may significantly reduce expected royalty revenue and require significant expense and management time to address the associated legal and regulatory issues.\nAdditionally, Tysabri\u00ae sales growth cannot be assured given the significant restrictions on its use and the significant safety warnings on the label, including the risk of developing Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (\"PML\"), a serious brain infection. The risk of developing PML may increase with prior immunosuppressant use, longer treatment duration, or the presence of certain antibodies. Increased incidence of PML could limit sales growth, prompt regulatory review, require significant changes to the label, or result in market withdrawal. In addition, the result of ongoing or future clinical trials involving Tysabri\u00ae or other adverse events reported in association with the use of Tysabri\u00ae may have an adverse impact on prescribing behavior and reduce sales of Tysabri\u00ae.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that Royalty Pharma will pay either or both of the milestone payments even if the specified thresholds are met.\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key members of management. Recently, we replaced our chief financial officer, chief executive officer and the general managers of both our CHCI and RX segments. Our inability to successfully manage the transition with respect to these key executives, or the failure to attract and retain other key members of management, may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nWe are dependent on the services of certain key employees, and our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Key functions for us include executive managers, operational managers, R&D scientists, information technology specialists, financial and legal specialists, regulatory professionals, quality compliance specialists, and sales/marketing personnel. If we are unable to attract or retain key qualified employees, our future operating results may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nIn April 2016, we announced that our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph C. Papa, resigned from the Company and that John T. Hendrickson, formerly our President, was appointed to serve as our new Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hendrickson was later appointed to serve as a member of our Board of Directors.\n\u2022\nIn April 2016, we announced that the former Executive Vice President and General Manager of our CHCI segment, Marc Coucke, resigned from the Company and that our current Executive Vice President and General Manager, International, Sharon Kochan, would undertake expanded responsibilities that include providing leadership and strategic direction to our CHCI segment.\n\u2022\nOn November 8, 2016, we appointed John Wesolowski the General Manager, President RX. Mr. Wesolowski served as Acting General Manager, RX following the resignation of Doug Boothe on July 20, 2016.\n\u2022\nOn February 27, 2017, we announced that our Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer, Judy L. Brown resigned from the Company and Ron Winowiecki, formerly our Senior Vice President, Business Finance, was appointed acting Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\n\u2022\nOn February 27, 2017, we announced the appointment of Svend Andersen to the position of Executive Vice President and President, Consumer Healthcare International.\nIf these management transitions are not successful, or if we are unable to attract or retain other key qualified employees, our future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are dependent upon consumers' perception of the safety, quality, and efficacy of our products, and may be affected by changing consumer preferences. Negative consumer perception may arise from media reports, product liability claims, regulatory investigations, or recalls, regardless of whether they involve us or our products. The mere publication of information asserting defects in products or ingredients, or concerns about our products or the materials used in our products, could discourage consumers from buying our products, regardless of whether such information is scientifically supported.\n\u2022\nOur products involve risks such as product contamination, spoilage, mislabeling, and tampering that could require us to recall one or more of our products. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses, delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products, or other governmental penalties, all of which could be detrimental to our reputation and reduce demand for our products.\n\u2022\nWe cannot guarantee that counterfeiting, imitation or other tampering with our products will not occur or that we will be able to detect and resolve it. Any counterfeiting or contamination of any products could negatively impact our reputation and sales, particularly if counterfeit or imitation products cause death or injury to consumers.\n\u2022\nMany of the brands we acquired from Omega have European recognition. This recognition is the result of the large investments Omega has made in its products over many years. The quality and safety of the products are critical to our business. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues,\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nincluding concerns about safety, quality, efficacy, or similar matters, sentiments toward us and our products could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nOur CHCI segment's financial success is dependent on the success of its brands, and the success of these brands can suffer if marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers and the performance of the segment may be negatively impacted if spending on such plans and initiatives does not generate the returns we anticipate. In addition, given the association of individual products within the commercial network of our CHCI segment, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of other products, thereby potentially hurting our financial results.\n\u2022\nPowdered infant formula products are not sterile. All of our infant formula products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration. Depending on the product, a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle, including the purchase and delivery of raw materials, the processing and packaging of food products, and the use and handling by consumers, hospital personnel, and healthcare professionals. In the event that certain of our infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration, whether or not under our control, our reputation and our infant formula product category sales could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputation damage.\nThe Company and our employees increasingly utilize social media as a means of internal and external communication.\n\u2022\nTo the extent that we seek to use social media tools as a means to communicate about our products and/or business, there are uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications, or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist. As a result, despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is risk that our use of social media for such purposes may cause us to be found in violation of them. A violation of such guidelines may damage our reputation as well as cause potential lawsuits and adversely affect our operating activities.\n\u2022\nOur employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media tools in ways that may not be aligned with our social media strategy, may give rise to liability, or could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others.\n\u2022\nNegative posts or comments about us, store brands or generic pharmaceuticals, or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation and could adversely affect the price of our securities. In addition, negative posts or comments about our products could result in increased pharmacovigilance reporting requirements, which may give rise to liability if we fail to fully comply with such requirements.\nOur quarterly results are impacted by a number of factors, some of which are beyond the control of our management, that may result in significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results.\nSome of the factors that may impact our quarterly results include the severity, length and timing of the cough/cold/flu and allergy seasons, the flea and tick season, the timing of new product approvals and introductions by us and our competitors, price competition, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in accounting pronouncements, changes in the levels of inventories maintained by our customers, and the timing of retailer promotional programs. These and other factors may result in significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter.\nWe may not be able to improve operating results in our business segments.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nWe have experienced a reduction in pricing expectations during 2016 in comparison to historical patterns in our U.S. businesses, in particular in our RX segment, due to industry and competitive pressures in the sector. The reduced pricing is attributable to a variety of factors including increased focus from customers to capture supply chain productivity savings, low raw material commodity pricing, competition in specific product categories, the loss of exclusivity on certain products, the recent increase in the speed and number of approvals from the FDA, and consolidation of certain customers in the RX segment. We have seen year-over-year pricing erosion in the second half of 2016 moderate from the levels experienced in the first half of 2016. We expect this pricing environment to continue to impact the Company for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nThe CHCI segment has been impacted by market dynamics in key countries such as Belgium, France, Germany and Italy due to softness in certain brand categories and by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit. In addition, the segment had been impacted in Belgium by a change in the forecast with a major wholesaler, as management implements improved supply chain efficiencies in this market. The CHCI segment has restructured its approach to addressing these markets including: (1) implementing a brand prioritization strategy to address these market dynamics, with an objective to balance the cost of advertising and promotional investments with expected contributions from category sales, (2) restructuring its sales force in each of these markets to more effectively serve customers, and (3) exiting certain unfavorable distribution agreements. The combination of these actions are expected to improve the segment's focus on higher value OTC products, reduce selling costs and improve operating margins in the segment.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience challenges related to our segments, and these challenges could have a material impact on our business, cash flows, and results of operations or result in impairment charges, and the market value of our ordinary shares and/or debt securities may decline.\nWe may not realize the benefits of business acquisitions and divestitures we enter into, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn the normal course of business we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions and divestitures. These transactions are accompanied by a number of risks. Many of these risks are beyond our control, and any one of them could result in increased cost, decreased Net sales and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, any or all of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAcquisitions\nOne of our strategies is inorganic growth through the acquisition of products and companies that we expect will benefit the Company. This strategy comes with a number of financial, managerial, and operational risks. We may not realize the benefits of an acquisition because of integration and other challenges, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nDifficulty involved with managing the expanded operations of the respective parties, as well as identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, and contingent and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nUncertainties involved in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of the respective parties, as well as identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, and contingent and other liabilities of acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nUnanticipated changes in the business, industry, market or general economic conditions different from the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the transaction;\n\u2022\nDifficulties due to a lack of, or limited experience in, any new product or geographic markets we enter;\n\u2022\nInability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies, or return on investment, from an acquisition in the amounts or on the time frame anticipated;\n\u2022\nSubstantial demands on our management, operational resources, technology, and financial and internal control systems, which could lead to dissatisfaction and potential loss of key customers, management, or\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nemployees;\n\u2022\nIntegration activities that may detract attention from our day-to-day business, and substantial costs associated with the transaction process or other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nDifficulties, restrictions or increased costs associated with raising future capital in connection with an acquisition may impact our liquidity, credit ratings and financial position, thereby making it more difficult, restrictive or expensive to raise future capital. In addition, the issuance of equity to pay a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition would dilute our existing shareholders.\nAs described in Item 1. Business - Major Recent Developments, in March 2015 we closed on the Omega acquisition. In addition to the risks mentioned above, Omega presents the following risks:\n\u2022\nOur success in the European markets in which Omega operates will depend on a number of factors, such as:\n\u25e6\nOur ability to commercialize new products;\n\u25e6\nOur ability to adapt to changes in economic and political conditions;\n\u25e6\nFluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;\n\u25e6\nCompliance with differing regulatory and legal requirements, including tax laws, trade laws, labor, safety, local content, consumer protection regulation, and import or export licensing requirements; and\n\u25e6\nConsistency and transparency of foreign tax systems, transfer pricing stability across jurisdictions, and our ability to reinvest earnings and cash as appropriate.\n\u2022\nWhile Omega has not historically been subject to U.S. laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, it has been subject to a wide range of European laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. The comparable U.S. laws and regulations to which Omega is now subject may differ from those to which Omega was historically subject. Therefore, it is possible that certain Omega sales or other activities that were permitted while Omega was an independent company may no longer be permitted. While we are continuing to put into place compliance processes and controls intended to ensure compliance with U.S. and global laws that now apply to Omega, if Omega\u2019s operations fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties.\nDivestitures\nWe may evaluate potential divestiture opportunities with respect to portions of our business (including specific assets or categories of assets) from time to time, and may proceed with a divestiture opportunity if and when we believe it is consistent with our business strategy and initiatives. Any future divestitures could expose us to significant risk, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and personnel to any purchaser;\n\u2022\nFees for legal and transaction-related services;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management resources; and\n\u2022\nLoss of key personnel and reduction in revenue.\nIf we do not realize the expected strategic, economic or other benefits of any divestiture transaction, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nWe have acquired significant assets that could become impaired or subject us to losses and may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have recorded significant intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of previous acquisitions, which could become impaired and lead to material charges in the future.\nAs of the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded the following impairments:\n\u2022\nGoodwill impairment charges of $1.1 billion related to our Specialty Sciences, BCH-Rest of World (\"ROW\"), BCH-Belgium, and Animal Health Reporting Units.\n\u2022\nIndefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $1.5 billion related to: trademarks, trade names and brands; developed product technology/formulation and product rights; distribution and license agreements; and supply agreements.\nWe perform an impairment analysis on intangible assets subject to amortization when there is an indication that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable. Any significant change in market conditions, estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known. As of December 31, 2016, the net book value of our intangible assets and goodwill were $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. See Item 8. Note 3 for more information on the above impairment charges.\nThere can be no assurance that our strategic initiatives will achieve their intended effects.\nWe are in the process of implementing certain initiatives designed to increase operational efficiency and improve our return on invested capital by globalizing our supply chain through global shared service arrangements, streamlining our organizational structure, making key executive employee changes, performing a strategic portfolio review, and disposing of certain assets. We believe these initiatives will enhance our net sales, operating margins, and earnings; however, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will produce the anticipated benefits. Any delay or failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our projected results.\nOn November 10, 2016, as part of our ongoing strategic portfolio review, we announced the following strategic actions: (1) exploring strategic alternatives for the potential sale our Tysabri\u00ae royalty asset, which is reported in our Specialty Sciences segment; (2) conducting a comprehensive internal evaluation of our businesses, including the Rx market position, growth opportunities and interdependencies with our other manufacturing and shared service operations to determine if strategic alternatives should be explored; and (3) conducting a review of segment and corporate cost structures to align with existing and future expected market dynamics. If we determine that we will pursue a strategic divestiture as a result of this portfolio review, our future business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the market value of our ordinary shares or credit ratings. We cannot provide any commitment regarding if or when any such divestiture would occur.\nIn furtherance of these strategic actions, on March 27, 2017, we completed the divestment of our Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, which consists of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in royalties earned if global net sales of Tysabri\u00ae meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. There can be no assurance these thresholds can be achieved.\nIn addition, on February 21, 2017, we approved a workforce reduction plan as part of a larger cost optimization strategy across the Company. We expect to reduce our global workforce by approximately 750 employees which includes some actions already taken and 235 employees who have elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement program. This represents a reduction of approximately 14% of our global non-production workforce. The changes to our workforce will vary by country, based on legal requirements and required consultations with works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate. We have announced that we expect to yield approximately $130.0 million in savings from these actions. There can be no assurance these benefits will be recognized. Further, these actions could lead to a disruption in production or loss in net sales.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nIn connection with this plan, we estimate that we will recognize total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million, consisting of one-time termination benefits, severance arrangements, and other termination costs. We anticipate recognizing substantially all of these charges by the year ended 2017, with the remaining balance to be recognized during the first quarter of the year ended 2018.\nThe filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will not make us \u201ccurrent\u201d in our Exchange Act filing obligations, which means we retain certain potential liability and are not eligible to use certain forms or rely on certain SEC rules.\nAlthough this is a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014, the transition period from June 28, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and the quarterly periods included within the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and June 27, 2015 and the transition period from June 28, 2015 to December 31, 2015, filing this report does not make us current in our filing obligations under the Exchange Act. Our failure to file all required Exchange Act reports, on a timely basis, means we remain potentially liable under the Exchange Act for those delinquencies, and the filing of this report does not preclude the enforcement staff of the SEC from taking action as a result of those filing delinquencies. Further, without the missing filings, investors may not be able to review certain financial and other disclosures that would be contained in those filings. In addition, we have not filed our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 1, 2017. We also were unable to include the required pro forma financial information in our Form 8-K filed on March 29, 2017 reporting the sale of our Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream. As a result, we will not be \u201ccurrent\u201d for purposes of Rule 144, Regulation S, and our Form S-8 registrations statements until we file that Form 10-Q and amend the Form 8-K to include the proforma financial information.\nWe have incurred significant additional costs to complete the restatements of previously issued financials and to remediate our material weaknesses and failure to timely file our periodic reports, which may result in reduced operating results in future periods.\nAs part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have restated previously filed financial statements, and we are in the process of remediating our previously existing material weaknesses and evaluating if further remedial action is appropriate. These efforts and actions related to the restatements of our financial statements have been time consuming and expensive and could expose us to a number of additional risks, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn particular, we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant expense, including significant audit, legal, consulting, and other professional fees in connection with the restatements of our previously issued financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps, including adding significant internal resources and implementing a number of additional procedures, in order to strengthen our accounting and tax functions and attempt to reduce the risk of additional misstatements in our financial statements. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting; failure to remediate the material weakness could negatively impact our business and the price of our ordinary shares.\nIn connection with our review of certain material misstatements related to the characterization of the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream acquired in the Elan transaction, as well as material misstatements related to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities that existed at the time of the acquisition of Omega, and the evaluation of long-lived assets in our Animal Health Reporting Unit for impairment testing, in each case contained in certain of our historical financial statements, we have concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that contributed to those misstatements. As a result of the material weaknesses, which existed at December 31, 2016, we have concluded that we did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). The failure to maintain effective control over financial reporting in turn resulted in material deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nWe have identified and begun the implementation of actions, and continue to identify and implement, actions to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, but there can be no assurance that such remediation efforts will be successful. We have also incurred and will continue to incur substantial accounting, legal, consulting, and other costs in connection with identifying and remediating the material weaknesses. Failure to remediate the material weaknesses could have a negative impact on our business and the market for our ordinary shares. For more information on our material weaknesses and the status of our remediation efforts. See Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, which includes Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nGlobal Risks\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations.\nWe manufacture, source raw materials, and sell our products in a number of countries. The percentage of our business outside the U.S. has been increasing particularly as a result of the Omega acquisition. We are subject to risks associated with international manufacturing and sales, including:\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nProblems related to markets with different cultural biases or political systems;\n\u2022\nPossible difficulties in enforcing agreements;\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles and shipping lead-times;\n\u2022\nDifficulties obtaining export or import licenses;\n\u2022\nChanges to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., including but not limited to, goods imported from Mexico; and\n\u2022\nImposition of withholding or other taxes.\nAdditionally, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering import/export regulations. To the extent that we are unable to successfully defend against an audit or review, we may be required to pay assessments, penalties, and increased duties.\nCertain of our facilities operate in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board, which allows us certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities. If the Foreign Trade Zone Board were to revoke the sub-zone designation or limit our use, we could be subject to increased duties.\nAlthough we believe that we conduct our business in compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and economic sanctions or other anti-corruption laws, if we are found to not be in compliance with such laws or other anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to governmental investigations, legal or regulatory proceedings, substantial fines, and/or other legal or equitable penalties. This risk increases in locations outside of the U.S., particularly in locations that have not previously had to comply with the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws.\nCurrent and changing global economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nA number of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been negatively impacted by slowing growth rates or recessionary conditions, political disruptions, exchange rate and market volatility.\n\u2022\nSeveral emerging market economies are particularly vulnerable to the impact of rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, weaker oil and other commodity prices, and large external deficits. While some of these jurisdictions are showing signs of stabilization or recovery, others, such as Ukraine, Russia and Greece, continue to experience levels of stress and volatility. Risks in one country can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in another country or countries. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our operations.\n\u2022\nWhile the challenging global economic environment has not had a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources, there can be no assurance that possible future changes in global financial markets and global\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\neconomic conditions will not affect our liquidity or capital resources, impact our ability to obtain financing, or decrease the value of our assets.\n\u2022\nThe challenging economic conditions have also impacted the movements in exchange rates, which have experienced significant recent volatility, including the unfavorable foreign currency impact on the British pound due to Brexit. Uncertainty regarding the future growth rates between countries, the influence of central bank actions, and the changing political environment globally may contribute to continued high levels of exchange rate volatility, which could have an adverse impact on our results.\n\u2022\nOur customers could be adversely impacted if economic conditions worsen. Our CHCA segment does not advertise its products like national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share. If our customers do not have the ability to invest in store brand promotional activities, our sales may suffer. Additionally, while we actively review the credit worthiness of our customers and suppliers, we cannot fully predict to what extent they may be negatively impacted by slowing economic growth.\nThe international scope of our business exposes us to risks associated with foreign exchange rates.\nWe report our financial results in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our net sales, assets, indebtedness and other liabilities, and costs are denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies include among others the euro, Indian rupee, British pound, Canadian dollar, Israeli shekel, Australian dollar, and Mexican peso. The addition of Omega, a euro-denominated business, that represents a significant portion of our net sales and earnings, and a substantial portion of our net assets, has significantly increased our exposure to changes in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. In addition, approximately 29% of Omega\u2019s sales are in other foreign currencies, with the majority of the product costs for these markets denominated in euros. Movements in exchange rates have experienced significant recent volatility due in part to the challenging economic conditions noted above. In 2016, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and British pound and the euro and British pound in particular experienced significant volatility due to Brexit and adversely impacted our results of operations. Our results of operations and, in some cases, cash flows, have in the past been, and may in the future, be adversely affected by movements in exchange rates. In addition, we may also be exposed to credit risks in some of those markets. We may implement currency hedges or take other actions intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not successful in mitigating the effects of changes in exchange rates on our business, any such changes could materially impact our results.\nWe operate in jurisdictions that could be affected by economic and political instability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations could be affected by economic or political instability, embargoes, military hostilities, unstable governments and legal systems, and inter-governmental disputes. We have significant operations in Israel, which has experienced varying degrees of hostility in recent years. Doing business in Israel and certain other regions including Mexico and Eastern Europe involves the following risks:\n\u2022\nCertain countries and international organizations have refused to do business with companies with Israeli operations. We are also precluded from marketing our products to certain countries due to U.S. and Israeli regulatory restrictions. International economic sanctions and boycotts of our products could negatively impact our sales and ability to export our products.\n\u2022\nOur facilities in Israel are within a conflict zone. If terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to our facilities, our business activities would be disrupted since, with respect to most products, we would need to obtain prior regulatory agency approval for a change in manufacturing site. In addition, our insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Department of State and other governments have at times issued advisories regarding travel to certain countries in which we do business. As a result, regulatory agencies have at various times curtailed or prohibited their inspectors from traveling to inspect facilities. If these inspectors are unable to inspect our facilities, the regulatory agencies could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities.\n\u2022\nOur international operations may be subject to interruption due to travel restrictions, war, terrorist acts, and other armed conflicts. For example, Belgium, France, Turkey, and Eastern Europe may be exposed to further acts of terrorism, which could give rise to travel and increased security restrictions. Also, further threats of armed hostilities in Mexico could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the cancellation of contracts or the loss of assets. These events could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations.\n\u2022\nThe UK held a referendum on June 23, 2016 on its membership in the EU. A majority of UK voters voted to exit the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d), and negotiations will commence to determine the future terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, subject to a negotiation period that could last up to two years after the UK government formally initiates the withdraw process, including the terms of trade between the UK and the EU. Brexit has created significant instability and volatility in the global financial markets, has led to significant weakening of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, they may impair the ability of our operations in the EU to transact business in the future in the UK, and similarly the ability of our UK operations to transact business in the future in the EU. Specifically, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Further, among other things, Brexit could reduce consumer spending in the UK and the EU, which could result in decreased demand for our products. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Insurance\nWe are or may become involved in lawsuits and may experience unfavorable outcomes of such proceedings.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits arising from a wide variety of commercial, manufacturing, development, marketing, sales and other business-related matters, including, but not limited to, competitive issues, pricing, contract issues, intellectual property matters, false advertising, unfair competition, taxation matters, workers' compensation, product quality/recall, environmental remediation, securities law, disclosure, and regulatory issues. Litigation is unpredictable and can be costly. We intend to vigorously defend against any lawsuits, however, we cannot predict how the cases will be resolved. Adverse results in the cases could result in substantial monetary judgments. No assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in the future. See Item 8. Note 16 for more information.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to liability if our products violate applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions where our products are distributed. The successful assertion of product liability or other product-related claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, and we could incur substantial legal expenses. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and our reputation may suffer.\n\u2022\nWe are a defendant in product liability lawsuits arising out of serious adverse events, including deaths, which occurred in patients taking Tysabri\u00ae. We expect additional product liability lawsuits related to Tysabri\u00ae usage to be filed. Tysabri\u00ae's distributor, Biogen, and Perrigo will each be responsible for 50% of losses and expenses arising out of any Tysabri\u00ae product liability claims. Along with Biogen, we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits, however, we cannot predict how these cases will be resolved. Adverse results in one or more of these cases could result in substantial monetary judgments not covered by insurance.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nWe may face environmental exposures including, for example, those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. While we do not have any material remediation liabilities currently outstanding, we may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under or in our currently or formerly owned property, or from a third-party disposal facility that we may have used, without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants. The actual or alleged presence of these substances, or the failure to remediate them, could have adverse effects, including, for example, substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on our ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on us. See Item 1. Business - Information Applicable to All Reportable Segments - Environmental for more information.\n\u2022\nOur CHCI segment regularly makes advertising claims regarding the effectiveness of its products, which we are responsible for defending. An unsuccessful defense of product-related claims could result in potentially significant monetary damages and substantial legal expenses. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, not merited, or not fully pursued, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim, and our reputation could suffer.\n\u2022\nWe are a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey in which the complaint alleges violations of Securities Exchange Act sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5) and 14(e) against both Perrigo and our former Chief Executive Officer, Joseph C. Papa, and 20(a) control person liability against Mr. Papa. In general, the allegations concern the actions taken by the Company and the former executive to defend against the hostile takeover bid by Mylan in the period April 21, 2015 through November 13, 2015. The plaintiff also alleges that we provided inadequate disclosure concerning alleged integration problems as a result of the Omega acquisition in the period April 21, 2015 through May 11, 2016. Another securities class action case was also filed in the same court making essentially the same claims on behalf of a class of persons who sold put options in Perrigo shares during the same class period. In December 2016, the court consolidated the two actions. In February 2017, the court selected the lead plaintiffs and the lead counsel to the putative class. In March 2017, the court entered a scheduling order that sets a deadline for the lead plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. That deadline has not yet passed.\n\u2022\nWe along with certain of our current and former executive officers and board members are also defendants in a securities class action suit where the plaintiff alleges violations of Israeli law in the District Court of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. On June 15, 2016, we filed a motion to stay the case pending the outcome of the U.S. securities class actions. The plaintiffs did not oppose the motion. The Israeli court granted the motion on the same day, and the action is stayed.\n\u2022\nWe are a defendant in a securities claims which the complaint commenced an action in the District Court of Tel Aviv-Jaffa asserting securities claims against Perrigo and our auditor Ernst & Young LLP (\"EY\"). The case is styled Keinan v. Perrigo Company plc, et al. The action seeks certification of a class of purchasers of Perrigo shares on the Israeli exchange beginning February 6, 2014. The proposed closing date for the class is not clear. In general, the plaintiff asserts that Perrigo improperly accounted for its stream of royalty income from two drugs: Tysabri\u00ae and Prialt. The court filings contend that the alleged improper accounting caused the audited financial results for Perrigo to be incorrect for the year ended December 31, 2016, six months ended December 31, 2015, and the years ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014 and the other financial data released by the Company over those years to also be inaccurate. The plaintiff maintains that the defendants are liable under Israeli securities law or, in the alternative, under U.S. securities law principles. The plaintiff indicates an initial, preliminary class damages estimate of 686.0 million NIS (approximately $187.0 million). The response from Perrigo and EY is not yet due. Perrigo is consulting Israeli counsel about its response to these allegations.\nIncreased scrutiny on pricing practices and competition in the pharmaceutical industry, including antitrust enforcement activity by government agencies and class action litigation, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nThere has been increased scrutiny regarding sales, marketing, and pricing practices in the pharmaceutical industry from both government agencies and the media, including allegations of \u201cprice gouging\u201d and/or collusion. This includes recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and hearings in connection with the investigation of specific price increases by several pharmaceutical companies, proposed legislation seeking greater transparency in drug pricing, and criminal investigations regarding drug pricing. U.S. federal and state prosecutors have issued subpoenas to a number of pharmaceutical companies seeking information about their drug pricing practices, and several class action lawsuits have been filed that allege price-fixing with respect to various pharmaceutical products. In December 2016, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cAntitrust Division\u201d) filed criminal charges against two former executives from a competitor of the Company for their roles in conspiracies to fix prices, rig bids and allocate customers for certain generic drugs.\nOn May 2, 2017, we disclosed that search warrants were executed at a number of Perrigo facilities and other locations in connection with the Antitrust Division\u2019s ongoing investigation related to drug pricing in the pharmaceutical industry. Although no charges have been brought to date against Perrigo or any of our current employees (or, to the best of our knowledge, former employees), we take the investigation very seriously.\nIf criminal antitrust charges are filed involving Perrigo, we would incur substantial litigation and other costs, and could face substantial monetary penalties, injunctive relief, negative publicity and damage to our reputation. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, responding to those charges would divert management\u2019s time and attention and could impair our operations . Further, we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory changes may result from the ongoing public scrutiny of our industry, what the nature of any such changes might be, or what impact they may have on Perrigo. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe are cooperating fully with the government\u2019s investigation and are committed to operating its business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and the highest standards of ethical conduct. We do not condone, and will not countenance, any violation of these standards by our employees, agents, and business partners.\nPublishing earnings guidance subjects us to risks, including increased stock volatility that could lead to potential lawsuits by investors.\nBecause we publish earnings guidance, we are subject to a number of risks. Actual results may vary from the guidance we provide investors from time to time, such that our stock price may decline following, among other things, any earnings release or guidance that does not meet market expectations.\nIt has become increasingly commonplace for investors to file lawsuits against companies following a rapid decrease in market capitalization. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, named in these types of lawsuits. These types of lawsuits can be costly and divert management attention and other resources away from our business, regardless of their merits, and could result in adverse settlements or judgments.\nThird-party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit our ability to bring new products to market and may subject us to potential legal liability, causing us to incur significant costs.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u2022\nAs a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, the ability of our CHCA and RX segments to bring new products to market is often limited by third-party patents or proprietary rights and regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products. Launching new products prior to resolution of intellectual property issues may result in us incurring legal liability if the related litigation is later resolved against us. The cost and time for us to develop prescription and Rx-to-OTC switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that we introduce. Any failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner could cause us to lose market share, and our operating results could suffer.\n\u2022\nWe could have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This could require us to incur substantial expense and could divert significant effort of our technical and\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nmanagement personnel. If we are found to have infringed on the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Additionally, if we choose to settle a dispute through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products.\n\u2022\nAt times, our CHCA or RX segments may seek approval to market drug products before the expiration of patents for those products, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by our products. In these cases we may face significant patent litigation. Depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, we may, in certain circumstances, elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending, before any court decision, or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending, known as an \"at risk\" launch. The risk involved in an \"at risk\" launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails, the remedies available to the patent holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the holder, which are often significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. By electing to proceed in this manner, we could face substantial damages if we receive an adverse final court decision. In the case where a patent holder is able to prove that our infringement was \"willful\" or \"exceptional,\" under applicable law, the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages or we may be required to pay attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe success of certain of our products depends on the effectiveness of measures we take to protect our intellectual property rights and patents.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may manufacture and market similar products.\n\u2022\nWe have been issued patents covering certain of our products, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries. Any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us may not provide us with any significant competitive advantages for our products or may even be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by competitors. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using, or commercializing non-infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.\n\u2022\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees, and consultants. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, we may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights.\nSignificant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of the insurance we maintain could adversely impact our financial condition.\nTo protect the Company against various potential liabilities, we maintain a variety of insurance programs, including property, general and product, and directors' and officers' liability. We may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that we purchase. We are self-insured when insurance is not available or not available at reasonable premiums. Risks associated with insurance plans include:\n\u2022\nInsurance costs could increase significantly, or the availability of insurance may decrease, either of which could adversely impact our financial condition;\n\u2022\nDeductible or retention amounts could increase or our coverage could be reduced in the future and to the extent losses occur, there could be an adverse effect on our financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage we maintained;\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nProduct liability insurance may not be available to us at an economically reasonable cost (or at all for certain specific products) or our insurance may not adequately cover our liability in connection with product liability claims (see Item 8. Note 16 for further information related to legal proceedings); and\n\u2022\nAs our business inherently exposes us to claims for injuries allegedly resulting from the use of our products, we may become subject to claims for which we are not adequately insured. Unanticipated payment of a large claim may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax Related Risks\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") may not agree with the conclusion that we are treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"). For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\nFor Perrigo Company plc to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under section 7874 of the Code, either (i) the former stockholders of Perrigo Company must own (within the meaning of section 7874 of the Code) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of our stock by reason of holding shares in Perrigo Company (the \"ownership test\") as of the closing of the Elan acquisition or (ii) we must have substantial business activities in Ireland after the Elan acquisition (taking into account the activities of our expanded affiliated group).\nUpon our acquisition of Elan, Perrigo Company stockholders held 71% (by both vote and value) of our shares. As a result, we believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, we cannot assure that the IRS will agree with our position that the ownership test is satisfied. There is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions, including the application of the ownership test.\nBased on the limited guidance available, we currently expect that Section 7874 of the Code likely will limit our and our U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to use their U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Elan acquisition or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Elan acquisition.\nChanges to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nWe believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, any of the following could adversely affect our status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes:\n\u2022\nChanges to the inversion rules in section 7874 of the Code, the IRS Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or other IRS guidance; and\n\u2022\nLegislative proposals aimed at expanding the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nOn April 4, 2016, the United States Treasury (\"Treasury\") and the IRS issued a package of temporary regulations that incorporate the guidance promised in the 2014 and 2015 notices and provide other rules. These temporary regulations are generally effective for certain inversion transactions completed on or after November 19, 2015 or, in certain cases, to certain specified post-inversion transactions occurring after that date provided that an inversion transaction had occurred on or after September 22, 2014. We do not believe that those regulations would apply to our transaction, which occurred prior to those effective dates. Treasury and the IRS also issued final regulations on June 3, 2015, which address the \u201csubstantial business activities\u201d test of Section 7874 of the Code. We believe that those regulations, which have an effective date of June 4, 2015, also do not impact the treatment of our status as a foreign corporation under Section 7874, as our transaction also occurred prior to the effective date of those final regulations.\nOn October 16, 2016, Treasury released final regulations regarding corporate tax inversions and related earnings stripping. These final regulations include provisions that may be interpreted to impact otherwise common tax structures including intercompany financing and obligations. Although we continue to evaluate the impacts of the new regulations to our cross-border treasury management practices and intercompany financing structures, we have no assurance that these regulations will not impact our ability to utilize existing or similar structures in the future.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles relating to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\"). These changes are being adopted and implemented by many of the countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. In addition, the European Commission has launched several initiatives to implement BEPS actions including an anti-tax avoidance directive and having a common (consolidated) corporate tax base. It is unclear at present if all or any of these initiatives will be implemented by the EU countries. Comprehensive U.S. tax reform has been stated to be a priority by the new U.S. Administration and the U.S. Congress. Changes in U.S. tax laws or their interpretation, if adopted, could significantly increase our consolidated effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results particularly if the proposed border tax denying corporate tax relief on imports is introduced.\nAny of these changes could have a prospective or retroactive application to us, our shareholders, and affiliates, and could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner.\nOur effective tax rate may change in the future, which could adversely impact our future results from operations.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, which may impact our future results from operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nIncome tax rate changes by governments;\n\u2022\nThe jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nChanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards, changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives;\n\u2022\nChanges in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (such as proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform);\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\nExpiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives;\n\u2022\nDivestitures of current operations; and\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nRepatriation of non-U.S. earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nThe resolution of uncertain tax positions could be unfavorable, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that our tax filings are prepared in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties or interest assessments.\n\u2022\nIn the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit of our fiscal years ended June 27, 2009 and June 26, 2010 had previously concluded with the issuance of a statutory notice of deficiency on August 27, 2014. While we had previously agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $8.0 million (inclusive of interest) in November 2014, the statutory notice of deficiency asserted various additional adjustments, including transfer pricing adjustments. The statutory notice of deficiency's adjustments for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 asserted an incremental tax obligation of approximately $68.9 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the IRS\u2019s positions asserted in the statutory notice of deficiency. To contest the IRS's adjustments, in January 2015 we paid the incremental tax obligation (a prerequisite to contesting the proposed adjustments in U.S. district court), and in June 2015, we filed an administrative request for a refund with the IRS. The IRS subsequently denied our request for a refund. We anticipate filing a complaint in U.S. district court claiming a refund of the paid amounts prior to August 2017. An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n\u2022\nThe IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency on April 20, 2017 for the IRS audits of our fiscal years ended June 25, 2011 and June 30, 2012. While we agreed to certain adjustments in October 2016 and made minimal associated payments, the statutory notice of deficiency asserted various additional adjustments, including transfer pricing adjustments. The statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 asserted an incremental tax obligation of approximately $74.2 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the IRS's positions asserted in this notice. In anticipation of contesting the IRS's adjustments, in May 2017 we paid the incremental tax obligation (a prerequisite to contesting the proposed adjustments in U.S. district court) and expect to file an administrative request for refund.\n\u2022\nWe received notices of proposed adjustments on December 22, 2016 for the IRS audit of Athena Neurosciences, Inc., a subsidiary of Elan Corporation plc, which Perrigo acquired in December 2013,\nfor the years ending December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. We disagree with the IRS\u2019s positions asserted in the notices of proposed adjustments and intend to contest them. Additionally, examination of transfer pricing positions is ongoing.\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any audit or related litigation. Unfavorable resolutions of the audit matters discussed above could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nRisks Related to Capital and Liquidity\nOur historical failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC may limit our options in accessing the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which in turn may limit our ability to pursue future transactions or strategies.\nWe did not timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2017. Any failure by us to timely file one or more of our periodic reports or otherwise remain current in our SEC reporting requirements may inhibit our ability to access the public markets to raise capital. For example, we are not eligible to use Form S-3 until we are current in our SEC\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\nreporting requirements and we establish the required history of making timely filings for 12 full calendar months. The ability to use Form S-3 to register public offerings in the United States offers certain benefits, such as relatively lower costs and shorter timeframes to prepare a registration statement and cause it to become effective, which may enhance our ability to take advantage of positive market conditions as they develop. The limited availability of access to the public markets could increase the time and costs related to raising capital or prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing future business strategies.\nAs described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 16, 2017, we entered into amendments the 2014 Revolver and the 2014 Term Loan providing for additional time to deliver certain financial statements, as well as the modification of certain financial and other covenants. Also, as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2017, we entered into additional amendments to the 2014 Revolver and the 2014 Term Loan to modify provisions of such agreements necessary as a result of the correction in accounting related to the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream, as well as waivers of any default or event of default that may arise from any restatement of or deficiencies in our financial statements for the periods specified in such amendments and waivers. No default or event of default existed prior to entering into these amendments and waivers under the 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes, or 2016 Notes. We are in compliance with all covenants under those Notes as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of the filing date, we are in compliance with all covenants, including the financial statement delivery obligations, under the 2013 Indenture and 2014 Indenture. However, if we do not file the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 1, 2017 within 15 calendar days after the due date of such report, we would not be in compliance with the financial statement delivery obligations under such indentures. See Item 8. Note 10 for more information on all of the above debt facilities and transactions.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic initiatives.\nWe anticipate that cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facilities will substantially fund working capital and capital expenditures. Our business requires continuous capital investments, and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect the business. At December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness outstanding was $5.8 billion.\n\u2022\nOur senior credit facilities, the agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain a number of restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied.\n\u2022\nWe also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. These restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions. If we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, agreements governing our senior notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could be in default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable.\n\u2022\nWhile we have announced our intention, consistent with our investment grade philosophy, to pay down a portion of our outstanding indebtedness during 2017 using the proceeds from our sale of the Tysabri\u00ae royalty stream and residual free cash flow, we cannot provide assurance that our debt pay down strategy will occur on the proposed time line, or at all, or that we will maintain our investment grade rating. Further, if our debt pay down strategy is delayed, we may be required to obtain further amendments or waivers of our financial covenants under our 2014 Revolver and 2014 Term Loan.\n\u2022\nAny default under our senior credit facilities or agreements governing our senior notes or other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance our debt or obtain sufficient new financing.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nDowngrades to our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase borrowing costs on current or future financing, including via trade payables with vendors. Customers' inclination to purchase goods from us may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings.\n\u2022\nThere are various maturity dates associated with our credit facilities, senior notes, and other debt facilities. There is no assurance that cash, future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. Further, there is no assurance that future refinancing or renegotiation of our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or additional agreements will not have materially different or more stringent terms. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will buy back our ordinary shares pursuant to our announced share repurchase plan or that our share repurchase plan will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nOn October 22, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase plan. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased shares through the plan totaling $500.0 million. During 2016, we did not purchase any shares in the open market. The remaining $1.5 billion in authorized repurchases may extend through the year ended December 31, 2018. The specific timing and amount of buybacks, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our ordinary shares, and the nature of other investment opportunities. Buybacks of our ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan could affect the market price of our ordinary shares or increase their volatility. Additionally, our share repurchase plan could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase plan is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so, and short-term share price fluctuations could reduce the plan\u2019s effectiveness.\nAny additional shares we may issue could dilute your ownership in the Company.\n\u2022\nUnder Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders, and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares up to a maximum amount equal to the authorized but unissued share capital, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by the articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\u2022\nSubject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory preemption rights by way of special resolution with respect to any particular allotment of shares.\n\u2022\nOur articles of association contain, as permitted by Irish company law, a provision authorizing the board to issue new shares for cash without offering preemption rights. The authorization of the directors to issue shares and the authorization of the waiver of the statutory preemption rights must both be renewed by the shareholders at least every five years, and we cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland; Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to, or otherwise adversely affect, our shareholders.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the \"Act\"). The Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors.\n\u2022\nUnder Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. As a result, shareholders of Irish companies do not have the right to bring an action against the directors or officers of a company, except in limited circumstances.\nPerrigo Company plc - Item 1A\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nDepending on the circumstances, shareholders may be subject to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law as a result of the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of ordinary shares, including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax, and capital acquisitions tax.\n\u2022\nThere is no treaty between Ireland and the U.S. providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. Before a foreign judgment would be deemed enforceable in Ireland, the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction and be for a final and conclusive sum. An Irish court may exercise its right to refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment if the foreign judgment was obtained by fraud, if it violated Irish public policy, if it is in breach of natural justice, or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment.\n\u2022\nAn Irish court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforced by Irish courts if deemed to be contrary to public policy in Ireland.\nWe are subject to Irish takeover rules under which our Board of Directors is not permitted to take any action without Irish Takeover Panel approval that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once we have received an approach that may lead to an offer, or have reason to believe an offer is imminent. Further, it could be more difficult for us to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction than if we were a U.S. company because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are greater, under Irish law.\nWe may be limited in our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nA number of factors may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future, including:\n\u2022\nThe availability of distributable reserves, as approved by our shareholders and the Irish High Court;\n\u2022\nOur ability to receive cash dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nCompliance with applicable laws and debt covenants; and\n\u2022\nOur financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.", "PERMNO": 77182, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRGO"}
