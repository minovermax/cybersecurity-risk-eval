{"cik": "1499717", "company": "Staffing 360 Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThere are numerous and varied risks that may prevent us from achieving our goals, including those described below. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations, could be harmed by any of the following risks. If any of the events or circumstances described below were to occur, our business, the financial condition and the results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose part or all of their investment. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses and thus may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the staffing industry, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Expected future operating losses will have an adverse effect on our cash resources, stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our stock and impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, diversify our portfolio of staffing companies, or continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have significant debt that could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations or put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our lenders could have a material impact on investors, including the requirement to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for our operations and the need to comply with the various covenants associated with such debt. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing. We could also be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions, or we may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage.\nOur debt instruments contain covenants that could limit our financing options and liquidity position, which would limit our ability to grow our business.\nCovenants in our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\npay cash dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase our common stock or other equity;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npermit liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments (including through the acquisition of stock, shares, partnership or limited liability company interests, any loan, advance or capital contribution);\n\u2022\nsell, lease, license, lend or otherwise convey an interest in a material portion of our assets; and\n\u2022\ncease making public filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictions in our debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. The lenders may require fees and expenses to be paid or other changes to terms in connection with waivers or amendments. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates.\nIn addition, these restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, withstand downturns in our business or take advantage of business opportunities. Moreover, additional debt financing we may seek, if permitted, may contain terms that include more restrictive covenants, may require repayment on an accelerated schedule or may impose other obligations that limit our ability to grow our business, acquire needed assets, or take other actions we might otherwise consider appropriate or desirable.\nWe have significant working capital needs and if we are unable to satisfy those needs from cash generated from our operations or borrowings under our debt instruments, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nWe require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. We often have high receivables from our customers, and as a staffing company, we are prone to cash flow imbalances because we funnel payroll payments from employers to temporary workers. Cash flow imbalances also occur because we must pay temporary workers even when we have not been paid by our customers. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If such a shortfall were to occur for even a brief period of time, it may have a significant adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to pay expenses relating to our temporary workers and to satisfy our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary workers and fund related tax liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers.\nIn addition, our operating results tend to be unpredictable from quarter to quarter. Demand for our services is typically lower during traditional national vacation periods in the United States and United Kingdom when customers and candidates are on vacation. No single quarter is predictive of results of future periods. Any extended period of time with low operating results or cash flow imbalances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive working capital for our operations through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments. We believe that our current sources of capital are adequate to meet our working capital needs. However, our available sources of capital are limited. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The amount we are entitled to borrow under our debt instruments is calculated monthly based on the aggregate value of certain eligible trade accounts receivable generated from our operations, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows. The aggregate value of our eligible accounts receivable may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities, which could reduce our ability to react to changes in the market or industry conditions.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 30, 2017, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $11,374, an accumulated deficit of $65,142, for the twelve months ended December 30, 2017 a net loss of $18,491. As a result of our recent financings, we believe that we will be able to fund our operations, implement our business plan and pursue the acquisition of broad spectrum staffing companies through the next twelve months. However, we will need to raise additional capital to pursue growth opportunities, improve our infrastructure, finance our operations and otherwise make investments in assets and personnel that will allow us to remain competitive. Additional capital would be used to accomplish the following:\n\u2022\nfinancing our current operating expenses;\n\u2022\npursuing growth opportunities;\n\u2022\nmaking capital improvements to improve our infrastructure;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining qualified management and key employees;\n\u2022\nresponding to competitive pressures;\n\u2022\ncomplying with regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining compliance with applicable laws.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then-outstanding. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of our securities for capital-raising or other business purposes. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to\nrecognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nFurthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business.\nA more active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it has only been traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market since September 29, 2015, when our common stock uplisted to the national exchange. Before that time, our common stock was traded on the OTCBB tier of the over-the-counter securities market run by FINRA, as well as OTCQB run by OTC Markets, and it first began trading on February 15, 2013. Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range. Between our stock splits occurring on September 17, 2015 and January 3, 2018, our common stock traded in a range from $0.54 to $7.74 per share. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. In addition, on January 25, 2017, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Capital Market notifying us that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the common stock did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), initiating an automatic 180 calendar-day grace period for us to regain compliance. On July 25, 2017, we received further notification from the Listing Qualifications Department that, while the Company\u2019s common stock had not regained compliance with the minimum $1.00 per share bid price during the 180 calendar-day period since the date of the initial notice, the Company was eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until January 22, 2018, to regain price compliance. On November 13, 2017, we filed a definitive proxy statement announcing a special meeting of stockholders to be held on January 3, 2018 at which time we sought stockholder approval of a reverse stock split of our common stock in the range of one-for-two to one-for-ten. At that meeting the stockholders approved the proposal, and the Company effected a reverse split effective at 5:00 pm New York time on January 3, 2018 at a ratio of one-for-five. The company regained price compliance as the stock traded at above $1.00 for the ten subsequent trading days before the compliance date of January 22, 2018. There can be no assurance that the company will continue to meet the Continued Listing Standards contained in NASDAQ Listing Rules 5550(a) and 5550(b). Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a stockholder's ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, or if our shares are delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if there is a thin trading market or \"float\" for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile and it would be harder for a stockholder to liquidate any investment in our common stock. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates;\n\u2022\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts' projections;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of legislative or regulatory changes.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in the staffing industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nAn investment in our common stock should be considered illiquid and high risk.\nAn investment in our common stock requires a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. Because we did not become a public reporting company by the traditional means of conducting an underwritten initial public offering of our common stock, we may be unable to establish a liquid market for our common stock. In addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite primary or secondary offerings on our behalf or our stockholders in the future than they would if we had become a public reporting company by means of an underwritten initial public offering of common stock. If all or any of the foregoing risks occur, it would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares. FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\nOur growth of operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer.\nWe plan to continue growing our business organically through expansion, sales efforts, and strategic acquisitions, while maintaining tight controls on our expenses and overhead. Lean overhead functions combined with focused growth may place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources, resulting in internal control failures, missed opportunities, and staff attrition which could impact our business and results of operations.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for complex debt and equity instruments which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in such areas in future periods. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that our management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, our management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for complex debt and equity instruments. We developed a remediation plan designed to address the material weakness in our internal control over accounting for such instruments. Our plan includes pursuing third party technical accounting consultation in the matter of transactions that involve complex debt and equity instruments.\nAlthough we are working to remedy the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for complex debt and equity instruments, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accounting for complex debt and equity instruments could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and our management\u2019s time to comply with applicable requirements.\nAdditional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. These\nmisstatements could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our future debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.\nOur strategy of growing through acquisitions may impact our business in unexpected ways.\nOur growth strategy involves acquisitions that help us expand our service offerings and diversify our geographic footprint. We continuously evaluate acquisition opportunities, but there are no assurances that we will be able to identify acquisition targets that complement our strategy and are available at valuation levels accretive to our business.\nEven if we are successful in acquiring, our acquisitions may subject our business to risks that may impact our results of operation:\n\u2022\ninability to integrate acquired companies effectively and realize anticipated synergies and benefits from the acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of the acquired businesses at the expense of delivering results for the legacy business;\n\u2022\ninability to appropriately scale critical resources to support the business of the expanded enterprise and other unforeseen challenges of operating the acquired business as part of the Company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of the acquired businesses and/or inability of such key employees to be effective as part of the Company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nimpact of liabilities of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single supplier or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition;\n\u2022\nimpacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives; and\n\u2022\ninternal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies may be inadequate or ineffective.\nWe face risks associated with litigation and claims.\nWe are a party to certain legal proceedings that are currently pending, including NewCSI, Inc. v. Staffing 360 Solutions, Inc., as further described in this Form 10-K. In addition, from time to time, we may become involved in various claims, disputes and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and relate to contractual and other obligations. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on any claims made against us in any such lawsuit. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nThe potential U.K. exit from the European Union as a result of the U.K. triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn March 29, 2017, the U.K. triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union by notifying the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). Negotiations have commenced to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union, including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the European Union. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.\nThe announcement of Brexit also created (and the actual exit of the U.K. from the European Union may create future) global economic uncertainty. The actual exit of the U.K. from the European Union could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business. Any of these effects of Brexit (and the announcement thereof), and others we cannot anticipate, could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenue may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA significant portion of our expenditures are expected to be derived or spent in British pounds. However, we report our financial condition and results of operations in U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British pound will impact the amount of our revenues and net income. For example, if the British pound appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, the fluctuation will result in a positive impact on the revenues that we report. However, if the British pound depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, which was the case during 2016, there will be a negative impact on the revenues we report due to such fluctuation. It is possible that the impact of currency fluctuations will result in a decrease in reported consolidated sales even though we may have experienced an increase in sales transacted in the British pound. Conversely, the impact of currency fluctuations may result in an increase in reported consolidated sales despite declining sales transacted in the British pound. The exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to the British pound has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Though we may choose to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future, there is no guarantee such hedging, if undertaken, will be successful.\nWe depend on attracting, integrating, managing, and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs. Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, decrease in compensation levels relative to our competitors or modifications to our total compensation philosophy or competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our future success also depends upon our ability to manage the performance of our personnel. Failure to successfully manage the performance of our personnel could affect our profitability by causing operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses and reduce operating income.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified temporary workers.\nIn addition to the members of our own team, our success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified temporary workers who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers. We are required to continually evaluate our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available.\nOur revenue can vary because our customers can terminate their relationship with us at any time with limited or no penalty.\nWe focus on providing mid-level professional and light industrial personnel on a temporary assignment-by-assignment basis, which customers can generally terminate at any time or reduce their level of use when compared to prior periods. To avoid large placement agency fees, large companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge a fee based on a percentage of the first year\u2019s salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill have a large financial incentive to avoid agencies.\nOur business is also significantly affected by our customers\u2019 hiring needs and their views of their future prospects. Our customers may, on very short notice, terminate, reduce or postpone their recruiting assignments with us and, therefore, affect demand for our services. As a result, a significant number of our customers can terminate their agreements with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to a significant decrease in revenue within a short period of time that could be difficult to quickly replace. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers, our results of operations could suffer.\nIncreasing the growth and profitability of our business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional customers. Our ability to do so is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality services and offer competitive prices. If we are unable to execute these tasks effectively, we may not be able to attract a significant number of new customers and our existing customer base could decrease, either or both of which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and there is a substantial risk that our services could become obsolete or uncompetitive.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive. Our markets are characterized by pressures to provide high levels of service, incorporate new capabilities and technologies, accelerate job completion schedules and reduce prices. Furthermore, we face competition from a number of sources, including other executive search firms and professional search, staffing and consulting firms. Several of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. New and existing competitors are aided by technology, and the market has low barriers to entry. Furthermore, Internet employment sites expand a company\u2019s ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Personnel agencies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may attract technology-oriented companies to the professional staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company.\nOur future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with those developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, we believe that, with continuing development and increased availability of information technology, the industries in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies become obsolete or uncompetitive, our related sales and revenue would decrease. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations may be affected by global economic fluctuations.\nCustomers\u2019 demand for our services may fluctuate widely with changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Those conditions include slower employment growth or reductions in employment, which directly impact our service offerings. As a staffing company, our revenue depends on the number of jobs we fill, which in turn depends on economic growth. During economic slowdowns, many customer companies stop hiring altogether. For example, in prior economic downturns, many employers in our operating regions reduced their overall workforce to reflect the slowing demand for their products and services. We may face lower demand and increased pricing pressures during these periods, which this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures.\nWe are engaged in the acquisition of U.S. and U.K. based staffing companies, and our typical acquisition model is based on paying consideration in the form of cash, stock, earn-outs and/or promissory notes. To date, we have completed eight acquisitions. We intend to expand our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or products, subject to our business plans and management's ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable investments or acquisition targets in both new and existing service\ncategories. In certain circumstances, acceptable investments or acquisition targets might not be available. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position;\n\u2022\ndifficulty maintaining the quality of services that such acquired companies have historically provided;\n\u2022\npotential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\noverpayment for the acquired company or assets or failure to achieve anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nchallenges in implementing uniform standards, accounting policies, customs, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nloss of customers and a failure to integrate customer bases.\nOur business plan for continued growth through acquisitions is subject to certain inherent risks, including accessing capital resources, potential cost overruns and possible rejection of our business model and/or sales methods. Therefore, we provide no assurance that we will be successful in carrying out our business plan. We continue to pursue additional debt and equity financing to fund our business plan. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition, if we incur indebtedness to finance an acquisition, it may reduce our capacity to borrow additional amounts and require us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the cash resources available to us to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and meet general corporate and working capital needs. This increased indebtedness may also limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry. The use of our common stock or other securities (including those convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock) to finance any such acquisition may also result in dilution of our existing shareholders.\nThe potential risks associated with future acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, result in the loss of key customers or personnel, increase expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon technology services, and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our customer relationships and our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nOur business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, and we may lose data. Our customers\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate. If an interruption by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems occurs, we could be liable and the market perception of our services could be harmed.\nWe could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate or customer data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, customers, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. In doing so, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third party vendors we use for a variety of processes. We and our third party vendors have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information\nsystems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs.\nSuch disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we introduce new services and offerings, such as mobile technology. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to customer information systems and confidential information. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to:\n\u2022\ndiscrimination and harassment;\n\u2022\nwrongful termination or denial of employment;\n\u2022\nviolations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u2022\nclassification of temporary workers;\n\u2022\nassignment of illegal aliens;\n\u2022\nviolations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u2022\nretroactive entitlement to temporary worker benefits;\n\u2022\nerrors and omissions by our temporary workers;\n\u2022\nmisuse of customer proprietary information;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of funds;\n\u2022\ndamage to customer facilities due to negligence of temporary workers; and\n\u2022\ncriminal activity.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nOur compliance with complicated regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted in additional expenses. Moreover, our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is uncertain given our management\u2019s relative inexperience with operating public companies.\nWe are faced with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. In addition, as a staffing company, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing compliance work.\nOur failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws,\nregulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nThe requirements of being a public company place significant demands on our resources.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Capital Market, have imposed various requirements on public companies. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and changes in required accounting practices and rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the by NASDAQ Capital Market, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements.\nShareholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. Consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, for the development, operation, and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to holders of our common stock would therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends by certain of our existing agreements. In addition, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, as they are at this time, we are not able to declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividend on any shares of common stock, unless at the time of such dividend we have paid all accrued and unpaid dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Therefore, we cannot be certain if we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nUpon our dissolution, you may not recoup all or any portion of your investment.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the proceeds and/or assets of our company remaining after giving effect to such transaction, and the payment of all of our debts and liabilities will be distributed to the stockholders of common stock on a pro rata basis. There can be no assurance that we will have available assets to pay to the holders of common stock, or any amounts, upon such a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company. In this event, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 15662, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "STAF"}
