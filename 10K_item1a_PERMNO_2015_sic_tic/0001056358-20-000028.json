Several of the risks are part of conducting business in the industry and sales channel in which we operate and will likely remain ongoing. The fact that these risks are characteristic of the dietary supplement industry or the direct selling channel does not lessen their significance. The risks outlined below are not the only risks we may encounter. Additional risks not currently known to us or that may currently reasonably seem immaterial also may have an adverse effect on our business.\n1.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain independent associates, our business may suffer.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to attract and retain a large active base of independent associates and preferred customers. We rely on our non-employee independent associates to market and sell our products to customers to generate growth and to attract new independent associates who are interested in building a business. Our ability to increase sales depends on our ability to increase the number of customers in each of our markets around the world. Our success will also depend on our ability to retain and motivate our existing independent associates and attract new independent associates. We cannot give any assurances that the number of our independent associates will continue at their current levels or increase in the future. Several factors affect our ability to attract and retain independent associates and preferred customers, including:\n\u2022\non-going motivation of our independent associates;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in the amount of commissions paid;\n\u2022\npublic perception and acceptance of the wellness industry;\n\u2022\npublic perception and acceptance of network marketing;\n\u2022\npublic perception and acceptance of our business and our products, including any negative publicity;\n\u2022\nthe limited number of people interested in pursuing network marketing as a business;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide proprietary quality-driven products that the market demands; and\n\u2022\ncompetition in recruiting and retaining independent associates.\n2.\nThe loss of key high-level independent associate leaders could negatively impact our associate growth and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 169,000 active independent associates and preferred customer positions held by individuals who purchased our products within the last 12 months, of which 194 occupied the highest associate levels under our global compensation plan. These independent associate leaders are important in maintaining and growing our revenue. As a result, the loss of a high-level independent associate or a group of leading associates in the independent associates\u2019 networks of downlines, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our associate growth and our revenue.\n3.\nChanges to our associate compensation arrangements could be viewed negatively by some independent associates, could cause failure to achieve desired long-term results and have a negative impact on revenue.\nOur associate compensation plan includes components that differ from market to market. We modify components of our compensation plan from time to time in an attempt to remain competitive and attractive to existing and potential independent associates, including such modifications:\n\u2022\nto address changing market dynamics;\n\u2022\nto provide incentives to independent associates that are intended to help grow our business;\n\u2022\nto conform to local regulations; and\n\u2022\nto address other business needs.\n4.\nAn increase in the amount of commissions and incentives paid to independent associates reduces our profitability.\nThe payment of commissions and incentives, including bonuses and prizes, is our most significant expense. Together, our commissions and incentives range approximately from 35% to 43% of our consolidated net sales. We closely monitor the amount of commissions and incentives as a percentage of net sales and may periodically adjust our compensation plan to better manage these costs. There can be no assurance that changes to the compensation plan will be successful in achieving target levels of commissions and incentives as a percentage of net sales and preventing these costs from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Furthermore, such changes may make it difficult to attract and retain independent associates or cause us to lose some of our existing independent associates.\n5.\nThe loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the continued services of our executive officers and senior management team as they work closely with independent associate leaders and are responsible for our day-to-day operations. Our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain senior executive officers, and do not believe that any of them are planning to leave or retire in the near term, we cannot assure that our senior executive officers or members of our senior management team will remain with us. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, including our regional and country managers, or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or independent associate relations.\n6.\nIf government regulations regarding network marketing change or are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to our business, we may be subject to new enforcement actions and material limitations regarding our overall business model.\nNetwork marketing is always subject to extensive governmental regulations, including foreign, federal, and state regulations. Any change in legislation and regulations could affect our business. Furthermore, significant penalties could be imposed on us for failure to comply with various statutes or regulations. Violations may result from:\n\u2022\nambiguity in statutes;\n\u2022\nregulations and related court decisions;\n\u2022\nthe discretion afforded to regulatory authorities and courts interpreting and enforcing laws;\n\u2022\nnew regulations affecting our business; and\n\u2022\nchanges to, or interpretations of, existing regulations affecting our business.\nOn January 4, 2018, The Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) issued \u201cBusiness Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing\u201d a non-binding guidance in question-and-answer format clarifying the FTC\u2019s enforcement position regarding multi-level marketing. The guidance focuses on the characteristics of multi-level marketing and delineates the factors that the FTC staff is likely to consider in assessing whether or not a compensation structure is problematic. The FTC has broad enforcement authority and, while it issues guidance on how it interprets the applicable law, that guidance is not ultimately binding on the FTC. As a result, the FTC could decide to investigate or bring an enforcement action regarding practices that we interpret to be in line with applicable law and/or FTC guidance. For example, the FTC has challenged the distributor compensation plans used by other multi-level-marketing companies over the last few years. The FTC obtained consent decrees with those companies requiring those companies to (i) discontinue using all, or certain components of, their compensation plans; and (ii) implement a compensation plan that received prior approval from the FTC.\nIn 2019, the FTC continued to challenge compensation plans and structures within the direct selling channel. In October 2019, following ongoing discussions with the FTC pertaining to an enforcement action, one of our competitors changed its business model from multi-level-marketing to direct-to-consumer as part of a stipulated order for permanent injunction. While consent decrees and orders entered into by our competitors are not binding on the Company, it does provide an insight into the FTC\u2019s priorities regarding its interpretation and enforcement of regulations pertaining to the multi-level-marketing business model. While we prioritize ensuring that our business and compensation model are compliant, we cannot be certain that the FTC or similar regulatory body in another country will not modify or otherwise amend its guidance, laws, or regulations or interpret in a way that would render our current practices inconsistent with the same.\n7.\nIndependent associates could fail to comply with our associate policies and procedures or make improper product, compensation, marketing or advertising claims that violate laws or regulations, which could result in claims against us that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe sell our products worldwide to a sales force of independent associates. The independent associates are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to provide the same direction, motivation, and oversight as we would if associates were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our associates will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our associate policies and procedures. All independent associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to our policies and procedures, which prohibit associates from making false, misleading or other improper claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products. However, independent associates may from time to time, without our knowledge and in violation of our policies, create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program. In addition to policies prohibiting improper product claims, we also have policies that prohibit our independent associates from selling our products or otherwise conducting business in markets outside of the countries in which we operate or in a manner inconsistent with how we operate in a specific country.\nThere is a possibility that some jurisdictions could seek to hold us responsible for independent associate activities that violate applicable laws or regulations, which could result in government or third party actions or fines against us, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. For example, Meitai does not operate as a direct selling company in mainland China and does not hold a direct selling license in China. Additionally, direct selling regulations in China prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. While we have policies that prohibit our independent associates from conducting business in markets other than those in which we currently operate and we have provided information on how Meitai operates in China as a non-direct selling business under an e-commerce model, we cannot guarantee that our independent associates will not violate our policies or violate Chinese law or other applicable regulations, and therefore, might result in regulatory action and adverse publicity, which would harm our business in China or our business generally.\n8.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent associates, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur independent associates are subject to taxation and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate tax records. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors. In the event that local laws and regulations require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or if our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities to be our employees, rather than independent contractors, we may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n9.\nChallenges by private parties to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to challenges by private parties, including our independent associates and preferred customers, to the form of our network marketing system or elements of our business. In the United States, the network marketing industry and regulatory authorities have relied on the implementation of distributor rules and policies designed to promote retail sales to protect consumers, prevent inappropriate activities, and distinguish between legitimate network marketing distribution plans and unlawful pyramid schemes. We have adopted rules and policies based on case law, rulings of the FTC, discussions with regulatory authorities in several states, and domestic and global industry standards. As a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (the \u201cDSA\u201d), we are required to adhere to a code of ethics that protects our associates and their customers, and ensures all DSA members remain accountable to regulators, consumers, independent distributors, and the public.\nOn January 4, 2019, the DSA established a third party self-regulatory program to be administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus (the \u201cCBBB\u201d). The new entity, the Direct Selling Self-Regulatory Council (\u201cDSSRC\u201d), will engage in active monitoring of the entire direct selling marketplace, including websites and social media of direct selling companies and their respective independent distributors in the areas of income representations and product claims. The DSSRC will report potentially non-compliant companies to the appropriate government agencies and will manage consumer/company complaint resolution.\nLegal and regulatory requirements concerning network marketing systems, however, involve a high level of subjectivity, are inherently fact-based, and are subject to judicial interpretation. Because of this, we can provide no assurance that we would not be harmed by the application or interpretation of statutes or regulations governing network marketing, particularly in any civil challenge by a current or former independent associate or preferred customer.\n10.\nIf our network marketing activities do not comply with government regulations, our business could suffer.\nMany governmental agencies regulate our network marketing activities. A government agency\u2019s determination that our business or our independent associates have significantly violated a law or regulation could adversely affect our business. The laws and regulations for network marketing intend to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes. Our business faces constant regulatory scrutiny due to the interpretive and enforcement discretion given to regulators, periodic misconduct by our independent associates, adoption of new laws or regulations, and changes in the interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations.\nOn December 5, 2018, our Korean subsidiary, Mannatech Korea (\u201cMK\u201d), received a visit from three officials with the Korean Fair Trade Commission (\u201cKFTC\u201d). They advised MK\u2019s management that they would be conducting a routine audit of commissions and bonuses paid to MK\u2019s independent associates. The physical audit was concluded on December 10, 2018. The KFTC issued the Examiner\u2019s Report on November 19, 2019. While MK has refined how incentive rewards are included in overall compensation for its associates in Korea in response to discussions with KFTC officials, no fines or sanctions were proposed in the report. Currently, MK is awaiting final approval from the KFTC about the disposition of the case. Final approval is anticipated during the first quarter of 2020. We cannot currently predict the outcome of the audit or any potential impact to our business, but a negative outcome could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, in the past, and because of the industry in which we operate, we have experienced inquiries regarding specific independent associates.\n11.\nIf we violate governmental regulations or fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, our operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operation is subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints at the federal, state, and local levels in our domestic and foreign markets. These regulations primarily involve the following:\n\u2022\nthe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale, and storage of our products;\n\u2022\nthe health and safety of dietary supplements, cosmetics and foods;\n\u2022\ntrade practice laws and network marketing laws (e.g., licensing and registration requirements; regulations pertaining to commission payments);\n\u2022\nour product claims and advertising by our independent associates;\n\u2022\nour network marketing system;\n\u2022\npricing restrictions regarding transactions with our foreign subsidiaries or other related parties and similar regulations that affect our level of foreign taxable income;\n\u2022\nthe assessment of customs duties;\n\u2022\nfurther taxation of our independent associates, which may obligate us to collect additional taxes and maintain additional records; and\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions.\nAny unexpected new regulations or changes in existing regulations could significantly restrict our ability to continue operations, which could adversely affect our business. For example, changes regarding health and safety and food and drug regulations for our nutritional products could require us to reformulate our products to comply with such regulations.\nOn October 16, 2018, inspectors from the FDA arrived at the Company\u2019s headquarters to conduct an inspection of the facility and an audit of the Company\u2019s policies and processes. The audit included a review of the remedial steps taken by the Company in response to the Warning Letter issued by the FDA on November 14, 2017. The FDA closed its audit on October 24, 2018 and issued its report to the Company. The investigators had no objections to the corrective actions taken by the Company in response to the November 2017 Warning Letter. The Company responded with corrective actions to the 2018 report on November 13, 2018. On March 1, 2019, we received a notice from the FDA requesting a meeting to discuss and clarify the corrective actions taken in response to the audit. The Company had 30 days to schedule a meeting with division personnel. We believe our response met the concerns raised by the FDA and do not anticipate further action; however, there remains the possibility that additional information or action may be requested following the meeting.\nIn some foreign countries, nutritional products are considered foods, while other countries consider them drugs. Future health and safety or food and drug regulations could delay or prevent our introduction of new products or suspend or prohibit the sale of existing products in a given country or marketplace. In addition, if we expand into other foreign markets, our operations or products could also be affected by the general stability of such foreign governments and the regulatory environment relating to network marketing and our products. If our products are subject to high customs duties, our sales and competitive position could suffer as compared to locally produced goods. Furthermore, import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions could limit our ability to import products from the United States.\nWe operate a non-direct selling business in mainland China. In 2016, we formed our China subsidiary, Meitai. Unlike Mannatech\u2019s business operations in other markets, Meitai operates under a cross-border e-commerce model, where consumers in China can buy Mannatech products manufactured overseas via Meitai's website. Meitai is currently not a direct selling company in China nor will it operate under a multi-level marketing model in China. Products purchased on Meitai's website are for personal use and not for resale. Meitai offers a rewards program to incentivize existing customers to refer other customers to purchase products from Meitai\u2019s website. Customs regulations in China include purchase limits to ensure that purchased products are for personal consumption. Regulators in China may change how they interpret and enforce regulations regarding e-commerce sales and how goods are imported through the free trade zone for sale to consumers in China. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of existing and new regulations will not negatively impact our business in China, result in regulatory investigations, or lead to fines or penalties against us.\nOn January 8, 2019, China\u2019s State Administration of Market Regulation, along with 12 other government ministries and agencies, jointly launched a nationwide \u201c100-day campaign\u201d to crack down on illegal practices involving health products, and in particular, those operating in the direct selling channel. The campaign was initiated amid growing controversies surrounding, Quanjian, a licensed direct selling company suspected of operating a pyramid scheme and engaging in marketing practices that exaggerated the effectiveness of its health products. Other direct selling firms operating in China were cautioned to stop making false or exaggerated health claims through public advertising and their distributors. As part of the 100-day campaign, China also suspended the registration, approval, and issuance of direct selling licenses. The 100-day campaign was completed on April 18, 2019. Subsequent to the campaign, Quanjian was fined approximately $14.0 million and its founder and chairman was sentenced to nine years in prison and assessed a fine of approximately $7.0 million.\nMany direct selling companies operating in China are still experiencing negative effects to their business operations including limited sales meetings, media scrutiny, and unfavorable consumer sentiment towards direct selling companies. Chinese officials of various ministries and agencies stated that they will continue to monitor healthcare product and direct selling companies. The suspension on issuing direct selling licenses remains in effect and it is unclear whether there will be changes to the application processes if and when the suspension is lifted.\n12.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements as well as new regulations that are being adopted in some of our markets with respect to nutritional supplements could result in more restrictive regulations and harm our results if our supplements or advertising activities are found to violate existing or new regulations or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations.\nThere has been an increasing movement in the United States and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional restrictions or requirements on us and increase the cost of doing business. On February 11, 2019, the FDA issued a statement from FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, regarding the agency's efforts to strengthen the regulation of dietary supplements. The FDA will be prioritizing and focusing resources on misbranded products bearing unproven claims to treat, cure, or mitigate disease. Commissioner Gottlieb established a Dietary Supplement Working Group tasked with reviewing the agency's organizational structure, process, procedures, and practices to identify opportunities to modernize the oversight of dietary supplements. Additionally, on December 21, 2015, the FDA created the Office of Dietary Supplements (\u201cODSP\u201d). The creation of this new office elevates the FDA\u2019s program from its previous status as a division under the Office of Nutrition and Dietary Supplements. ODSP will continue to monitor the safety of dietary supplements. In markets outside of the United States, prior to commencing operations or marketing new products, we may be required to obtain approvals, registrations, licenses, or certifications from an agency comparable to the FDA for the specific market. Approvals or registration may require reformulation of our products or may be unavailable to us with respect to certain products or ingredients. We must also comply with product labeling regulations, which vary by jurisdiction.\nIn several of our markets, new regulations have been adopted, or are likely to be adopted, in the near-term that will impose new requirements, make changes in some classifications of supplements under the regulations, or limit the claims we can make. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of nutritional supplements and marketing claims under existing and new regulations. In Europe, for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that have not been previously marketed in Europe without going through an extensive registration and approval process. Europe is also expected to adopt additional regulations in the future to set new limits on acceptable levels of nutrients. South Africa has also implemented new \u201ccomplementary medicine\u201d legislation, which requires a significant dossier in order to register current and new products. Mannatech is working toward complying with the new legislation and is in contact with the Direct Selling Association in South Africa. In August 2016, the FDA published its revised draft guidance on Dietary Supplements: New Dietary Ingredient Notifications and Related Issues. If a company sells a dietary supplement containing an ingredient that FDA considers either not a dietary ingredient or a new dietary ingredient (\u201cNDI\u201d) that needs an NDI notification, the agency may threaten or initiate enforcement against the Company. For example, it might send a warning letter that can trigger consumer lawsuits, demand a product recall, or even work with the Department of Justice to bring a criminal action. Our operations could be harmed if new guidance or regulations require us to reformulate products or effect new registrations, if regulatory authorities make determinations that any of our products do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, if the cost of complying with regulatory requirements increases materially, or if we are not able to effect necessary changes to our products in a timely and efficient manner to respond to new regulations. In addition, our operations could be harmed if governmental laws or regulations are enacted that restrict the ability of companies to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies.\n13.\nIf we are unable to protect the proprietary rights of our products, our business could suffer.\nOur success and competitive position largely depend on our ability to protect the following proprietary rights:\n\u2022\nour Ambrotose\u00ae complex, a glyconutritional dietary supplement ingredient consisting of a blend of monosaccharides, or sugar molecules, used in the majority of our products;\n\u2022\nthe MTech AO Blend\u00ae formulation, our proprietary antioxidant technology used in the Ambrotose AO\u00ae complex; and\n\u2022\na compound used in our reformulated Advanced Ambrotose\u00ae complex that allows for a more potent concentration of the full range of mannose-containing polysaccharides occurring naturally in aloe.\nWe have filed patent applications for the technology relating to our Ambrotose\u00ae, Ambrotose AO\u00ae, Ambrotose Life\u00ae, PhytoMatrix\u00ae, NutriVerus\u2122, and GI-ProBalance\u00ae products in the United States and certain foreign countries. As of December 31, 2019, we had nine patents for the technology relating to our Ambrotose formulation, all of which were issued, granted, and validated in eight foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our independent associates, suppliers, manufacturers, directors, officers, and consultants to help protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, we continue to face the risk that our pending patent applications for our products may not issue or that the patent protection granted is more limited than originally requested. As a precaution, we consult with outside legal counsel and consultants to help ensure that we protect our proprietary rights. However, our business, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected if we fail to receive adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nAlthough several patents pertaining to Ambrotose\u00ae technology have expired, Mannatech continues to actively explore additional patent protection of its technology and pursue expanded patent protection strategies. Our Ambrotose\u00ae product formulation has proprietary elements and we have contractual arrangements with certain suppliers affording us exclusive access to certain ingredients in those formulations. If we fail to maintain exclusivity with those suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. We have a number of pending patent applications for additional protection of Ambrotose\u00ae-related technology. The pending patent applications are at various stages of processing, depending on the timeline of each market\u2019s patent offices.\nMost of our patents for the Ambrotose AO\u00ae, GI-ProBalance\u00ae\u2122, PhytoMatrix\u00ae, NutriVerus\u2122, and PhytoBlend\u00ae formulations and our patents in the field of biomarker assays do not expire for another six or more years.\n14.\nOur inability to develop and introduce new products that gain independent associate, preferred customer, and market acceptance could harm our business.\nA critical component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our independent associates and preferred customers. If we are unable to introduce new products, our independent associate productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products, and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences.\n15.\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm our relationship with independent associates and preferred customers, our product sales, as well as our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences, including rapid and frequent changes in demand for products, new product introductions, and enhancements. Our failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products, which in turn could harm our independent associate and preferred customer relationships and cause the loss of sales. The success of our new product offerings and enhancements depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\naccurately anticipate consumer needs;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new products or product enhancements that meet these needs;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nprice our products competitively;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our independent associates and preferred customers in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete, which could negatively impact our revenues, financial condition, and operating results.\n16.\nIf our outside suppliers and manufacturers fail to supply products in sufficient quantities and in a timely fashion, our business could suffer.\nOutside manufacturers make all of our products. Our profit margins and timely product delivery are dependent upon the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to supply us with products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Our ability to enter new markets and sustain satisfactory levels of sales in each market depends on the ability of our outside suppliers and manufacturers to provide required levels of ingredients and products and to comply with all applicable regulations. As a precaution, we have approved alternate suppliers and manufacturers for our products. However, the failure of our primary suppliers or manufacturers to supply ingredients or produce our products could adversely affect our business operations.\nWe believe we have dependable suppliers for all of our ingredients and we have identified alternative sources for all of our ingredients, except Arabinogalactan and Manapol. Due to the unique nature of each ingredient, important components used in the formulation of our Ambrotose \u00ae complex, we are unable to identify an alternative supplier at this time. If our suppliers are unable to perform, any delay in replacing or substituting such ingredients could affect our business.\n17.\nThe loss of suppliers or shortages of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe depend on outside suppliers for raw materials. Our contract manufacturers acquire all of the raw materials for manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers. In the event we were to lose any significant suppliers and have trouble in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers, it could result in product shortages or product back orders, which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that suppliers will be able to provide our contract manufacturers the raw materials in the quantities and at the appropriate level of quality that we request or at a price that we are willing to pay. We are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials including weather, disease, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. For example, in December 2019, COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely impact our operations, including among others, our manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations and could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results.\n18.\nIf we are exposed to product liability claims, we may be liable for damages and expenses, which could affect our overall financial condition.\nWe could face financial liability from product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury. We can make no assurances that we will not be exposed to any substantial future product liability claims. Such claims may include claims that our products contain contaminants, that we provide our independent associates and consumers with inadequate instructions regarding product use, or that we provide inadequate warnings concerning side effects or interactions of our products with other substances. We believe that we, our suppliers, and our manufacturers maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage. However, a substantial future product liability claim could exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy, which could adversely affect our overall future financial condition.\nIn recent years, a discovery of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (\u201cBSE\u201d), which is commonly referred to as \u201cMad Cow Disease\u201d, has caused concern among the general public. As a result, some countries have banned the importation or sale of products that contain bovine materials sourced from locations where BSE has been identified. We have changed the vast majority of our capsules to a vegetable base. However, if a vegetable base is not available or practical for use, certifications are required to ensure the capsule material is BSE-free. The higher costs could affect our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows.\n19.\nConcentration Risk\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our Ambrotose Life\u00ae, Advanced Ambrotose\u00ae, TruHealth\u2122, Manapol\u00ae Powder, and GI-Pro products. A decline in sales value of such products could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and financial position. Revenue from these products were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages):\nSales by\nproduct\n% of total\nnet sales\nSales by\nproduct\n% of total\nnet sales\nAmbrotose Life\u00ae\n$\n34,975\n22.2\n%\n$\n18,824\n10.9\n%\nAdvanced Ambrotose\u00ae\n22,390\n14.2\n%\n44,054\n25.4\n%\nTruHealth\u2122\n16,193\n10.3\n%\n17,537\n10.1\n%\nManapol\u00ae Powder\n8,793\n5.6\n%\n8,636\n5.0\n%\nGI-Pro Balance\n6,559\n4.2\n%\n7,187\n4.2\n%\nTotal\n$\n88,910\n56.5\n%\n$\n96,238\n55.6\n%\nOur business is not currently exposed to customer concentration risk given that no independent associate has ever accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.\n20.\nIf we incur substantial liability from litigation, complaints, or enforcement actions or incur liabilities or penalties resulting from misconduct by our independent associates, our financial condition could suffer.\nRoutine enforcement actions and complaints are common in our industry. Although we believe we fully cooperate with regulatory agencies and use various means to address misconduct by our independent associates, including maintaining policies and procedures to govern the conduct of our independent associates and conducting training seminars, it is still difficult to detect and correct all instances of misconduct. Violations of our policies and procedures by our independent associates could lead to litigation, formal or informal complaints, enforcement actions, and inquiries by various federal, state, or foreign regulatory authorities against us and/or our independent associates in each country. Because we have expanded into foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our independent associates differ depending on the different legal requirements of each country in which an independent associate does business. Any future litigation, complaints, and enforcement actions involving us and/or our independent associates could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, profitability, and growth prospects.\n21.\nThe global nutrition and skin care industries are intensely competitive and the strengthening of any of our competitors could harm our business.\nThe global nutrition and skin care industries are intensely fragmented and competitive. We compete for independent associates with other network marketing companies outside the global nutrition and skin care industries. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition and financial resources, which may give them a competitive advantage. Our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to marketing, promotional, and pricing campaigns that may influence our continuing and potential independent associates and preferred customers to buy products from competitors rather than from us. Such competition could adversely affect our business and current market share.\n22.\nA downturn in the economy, including as a result of COVID-19, could affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as the health and wellness products that we offer, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of health and wellness products. A downturn in the economy, including as a result of COVID-19, could adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items such as health and wellness products. The United States and global economies may slow dramatically as a result of a variety of problems, including turmoil in the credit and financial markets, concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions, the state of the housing markets, and volatility in worldwide stock markets. In the event of such economic downturn, the U.S. and global economies could become significantly challenged in a recessionary state for an indeterminate period of time. These economic conditions could cause many of our existing and potential associates to delay or reduce purchases of our products for some time, which in turn could harm our business by adversely affecting our revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot predict these economic conditions or the impact they would have on our consumers or business.\n23.\nIf our international markets are not successful, our business could suffer.\nWe currently sell our products in the international markets of Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Namibia, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. We operate in China on a non-direct selling business model instead of our traditional network marketing model. In China, multi-level marketing is prohibited by the Prohibition of Pyramid Selling and direct selling without a license is prohibited by the Regulation on the Administration of Direct Sales. Our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements, as well as difficulties in adapting to new foreign cultures and business customs. If we do not adequately address such issues, our international markets may not meet growth expectations. Our international operations and future expansion plans are subject to political, economic, and social uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nthe renegotiation or modification of various agreements;\n\u2022\nincreases in custom duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\nchanges and limits in export controls;\n\u2022\ncomplex U.S. and foreign laws, treaties and regulations, including without limitation, tax laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar anti-bribery and corruption acts and regulations in many of the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\ntrademark availability and registration issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in taxation;\n\u2022\nwars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other hostilities;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic, and social conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nchanges to trade practice laws or regulations governing direct selling and network marketing;\n\u2022\nincreased government scrutiny surrounding direct selling and network marketing;\n\u2022\nchanges in the perception of network marketing; and\n\u2022\nrisk of our independent associates offering business opportunities in China.\nThe risks outlined above could adversely affect our ability to sell products, obtain international customers, or to operate our international business profitably, which would have a negative impact on our overall business and results of operations. Furthermore, any negative changes in our distribution channels may force us to invest significant time and money related to our distribution and sales to maintain our position in certain international markets.\n24.\nAdverse or negative publicity could cause our business to suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on the public\u2019s perception of our integrity and the safety and quality of our products. Any adverse publicity could negatively affect the public\u2019s perception about our industry, our products, or our reputation and could result in a significant decline in our operations and/or the number of our independent associates. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse or negative publicity regarding:\n\u2022\nthe nutritional supplements industry;\n\u2022\nskeptical consumers;\n\u2022\ncompetitors;\n\u2022\nthe safety and quality of our products and/or our ingredients;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations of our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe actions of our independent associates;\n\u2022\nthe direct selling/network marketing industry; and\n\u2022\nscandals or regulatory investigations regarding the business practices or products or our competitors, specifically those competitors within the direct selling channel.\n25.\nIf our information technology system fails or if the implementation of new information technology systems is not executed efficiently and effectively, our business, financial position, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nLike many companies, our business is heavily dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage and operate many of our key business functions, including:\n\u2022\norder processing;\n\u2022\nsupply chain management;\n\u2022\ncustomer service;\n\u2022\nproduct distribution;\n\u2022\ncommission processing;\n\u2022\ncash receipts and payments; and\n\u2022\nfinancial reporting.\nThese systems and operations are vulnerable to damage and interruption from fires, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, and other events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Although we maintain an extensive security system and business continuity program that was developed under the guidelines published by the National Institute of Standards of Technology, a long-term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business.\nOccasionally information technology systems must be upgraded or replaced and if this system implementation is not executed efficiently and effectively, the implementation may cause interruptions in our primary management information systems, which may make our website or services unavailable thereby preventing us from processing transactions, which would adversely affect our financial position or operating results.\nThe regulatory climate for data privacy and protection continues to grow in scope and complexity both domestically and in the international markets in which we operate. Although there is no single federal law in the United States imposing a cross-sectoral data breach notification obligation, virtually every state has enacted breach notification requirements. Additionally, many of the international countries in which we operate have proposed or enacted laws or regulations on the appropriate use and disclosure of financial and personal data. The European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to organizations based in the EU and organizations based outside of the EU that offer products or services to individuals in the EU or that otherwise monitor individuals in the EU. While U.S. state laws generally cover specific categories of sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, bank account numbers, and credit card numbers), the GDPR notification requirements will apply to incidents involving any personal data, meaning any data related to an identified person. In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) went into effect on November 1, 2018. PIPEDA applies to foreign organizations with a real and substantial link to Canada that collect, use, or disclose the personal information of Canadians in the course of their commercial activities. Under PIPEDA, an organization must notify individuals of any breach of the security of safeguards involving their personal information if it is reasonable to believe that the breach creates a \u201creal risk of significant harm.\u201d Concurrently, the organization must also report to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. As noted above, many states have enacted data protection requirements. Most recently, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), a state statute signed into law on June 28, 2018 and effective on January 1, 2020, provides enhanced data privacy protections to California residents. The CCPA applies to companies with annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million. Our failure or inability to comply with data protection regimes domestically and in foreign countries could result in fines, penalties, injunctions, or material litigation expenditures.\nWith increased frequency in recent years, cyber-attacks against companies have resulted in breaches of data security. Our business requires the storage and transmission of suppliers\u2019 data and our independent associates\u2019 and customers\u2019 personal, credit card, and other confidential information. Our information technology systems are susceptible to a growing and evolving threat of cybersecurity risk. Any substantial compromise of our data security, whether externally or internally, or misuse of associate, customer, or employee data, could cause considerable damage to our reputation, cause the public disclosure of confidential information, and result in lost sales, significant costs, and litigation, which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Although we maintain policies and processes surrounding the protection of sensitive data, which we believe to be adequate, there can be no assurances that we will not be subject to such claims in the future.\n26.\nTaxation and transfer pricing affect our operations and we could be subjected to additional taxes, duties, interest, and penalties in material amounts, which could harm our business.\nAs a multinational corporation, in many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that our intercompany transactions are consummated at prices that reflect the economic reality of the relationship between our entities and have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result, that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities, and that we are taxed appropriately on such transactions. Regulators closely monitor our corporate structure, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. If regulators challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers, our operations may be harmed and our effective tax rate may increase. Scrutiny has increased with the advent of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\"). The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") continues to issue guidance related to the passage of the Act. As new guidance is issued it may have a material impact on our financial statements. In addition, there is a risk that U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the Act, which could have a material impact on our future results. Our legacy tax structure was designed prior to this legislation. Under the Act, our future taxes might be higher, which may have a material impact on our profitability. As a result, during 2019 we amended our structure to be more in line with current tax legislation.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amount previously included in our income tax provision, and, therefore, could have a material impact on our profitability.\n27.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized 76.6% of net sales in markets outside of the United States and 69.6% in markets outside of the Americas. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized 73.9% of net sales in markets outside of the United States and 66.2% in markets outside of the Americas. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to translate certain financial information from foreign currencies to the United States dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the United States dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. For example, while our 2019 net sales declined 6.1% on a Constant dollar basis (see Item 7, Non-GAAP Financial Measures), unfavorable foreign exchange caused a $5.3 million decrease in GAAP net sales as compared to 2018. In other words, sales would have been $5.3 million higher, except for the impact of foreign exchange. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities.\n28.\nOur stock price is volatile and may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases. Decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock. The price of our common stock and the price at which we could sell securities in the future could significantly fluctuate in response to:\n\u2022\nbroad market fluctuations and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nfuture securities offerings;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s perception of our products or our business, including false or negative publicity;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any lawsuits;\n\u2022\nfinancial and business announcements made by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe demand and daily trading volume of our shares;\n\u2022\nthe general condition of the industry; and\n\u2022\nthe sale of large amounts of stock by insiders.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies. The changes sometimes appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock in the open market could fluctuate based on factors that have little or nothing to do with us or that are outside of our control. For example, general economic conditions, such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the United States or abroad, could negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the future.\n29.\nCertain shareholders, directors, and officers own a significant amount of our stock, which could allow them to influence corporate transactions and other matters.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our directors and executive officers collectively with their families and affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 33.6% of our total outstanding common stock. As a result, if two or more of these shareholders choose to act together based on their current share ownership, they may be able to control a significant percentage of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, which could affect the outcome of a shareholder vote on the election of directors, the adoption of stock option plans, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\n30.\nWe have implemented anti-takeover provisions that may help discourage a change of control.\nCertain provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the Texas Business Organizations Code help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our Company, even if the proposal may benefit our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the power to determine the price and terms of any preferred stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without shareholders\u2019 approval could deter or delay unsolicited changes of control by discouraging open market purchases of our common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for our common stock. Discouraging open market purchases may be disadvantageous to our shareholders who may otherwise desire to participate in a transaction in which they would receive a premium for their shares.\nIn addition, other provisions may also discourage a change of control by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, proxy contest or otherwise. Our charter documents provide for three classes of directors on our Board of Directors with members of each class serving staggered three year terms. Our bylaws provide that directors are elected by a plurality vote and that directors can only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to be cast for the election of such directors. Furthermore, our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings. In addition, the Texas Business Organization Code restricts, subject to exceptions, business combinations with any \u201caffiliated shareholder.\u201d Any or all of these provisions could delay, deter or help prevent a takeover of our Company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\n31.\nOur failure to comply with The Nasdaq Global Select Market continued listing standards may adversely affect the price and liquidity of our shares of common stock as well as our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Continued listing of a security on Nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining listing on Nasdaq. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, then our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock is delisted and we cannot obtain listing on another major market or exchange, our common stock\u2019s liquidity would suffer, and we would likely experience reduced investor interest. Such factors may result in a decrease in our common stock\u2019s trading price. Delisting may also restrict us from issuing additional securities or securing financing.\nAs of the date of issuance of this report, we were in compliance with the continued listing requirements. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in continuing to meet all requisite continued listing criteria.\n32.\nWe are not required to pay dividends, and our Board of Directors may decide not to declare dividends in the future.\nThe declaration of dividends on our common stock is solely within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to limitations under Texas law stipulating that dividends may not be paid if payment therefore would cause the corporation to be insolvent or if the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation. Our Board of Directors may decide not to declare dividends or we could be prevented from declaring a dividend because of legal or contractual restrictions. The failure to pay dividends could reduce our stock price.\n33.\nWe rely upon our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to fund our business and meet our contractual obligations. In the event that we do not generate adequate cash flow from operations, we will need to raise money through a debt or equity financing, if available, or curtail operations.\nThe adequacy of our cash resources to continue to meet our future operational needs depends, in large part, on our ability to increase product sales and/or reduce operating costs and some of these costs are fixed contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, cash and cash equivalents held in bank accounts in foreign countries totaled $18.2 million and $19.9 million, respectively.\nWe maintain supply agreements with our suppliers and manufacturers. Certain of our supply agreements contain exclusivity clauses for the supply of certain raw materials and products, some of which are conditioned upon compliance with minimum purchase requirements. One of our supply agreements, under which the supplier provides us with certain aloe vera-based products, requires us to purchase products in an aggregate amount of $5.3 million through 2022. Failure to satisfy minimum purchase requirements could result in the loss of exclusivity, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unsuccessful in generating positive cash flow from operations, we could exhaust our available cash resources and be required to secure additional funding through a debt or equity financing, transfer cash in a manner that could be taxed, significantly scale back our operations, and/or discontinue many of our activities, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. Additional funding may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\n34.\nThe reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as a \"smaller reporting company\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company we prepare and file SEC forms similar to other SEC reporting companies; however, the information disclosed may differ and be less comprehensive. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of less comprehensive information we may disclose pursuant to the exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile than that of an otherwise comparable company that does not avail itself of the same or similar exemptions.\nCircumstances and conditions may change. Accordingly, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or that we currently deem not material, may also adversely affect our business operations.\n35.\nThe spread of COVID-19 underscores certain risks we face, and the rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of COVID-19.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread to over 100 countries, including every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 underscores certain risks we face in our business that are described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Governmental and non-governmental organizations may not effectively combat the spread and severity of COVID-19, which could adversely impact our profitability. The adverse economic effects of COVID-19 may materially decrease demand for our products based on changes in consumer behavior or the restrictions in place by governments trying to curb the outbreak. For example, we have rescheduled corporate sponsored events, and in some cases, our associates have canceled sales meetings. This could lead to adverse impacts on our sales in fiscal year 2020 and our overall liquidity.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or actions taken to mitigate this spread, could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate effectively, including as a result of the complete or partial closure of certain businesses and the inability of our associates to market our products as a result of \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar policies that may be implemented in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity, and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the financial markets. We have started to experience challenges in getting raw materials and ingredients to our contract manufacturers and finished products to our distribution centers resulting from reductions in global transportation capacity.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of COVID-19. We are continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and related risks. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows is uncertain as this continues to evolve globally. However, if the spread continues on its current trajectory, such impact could grow and our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86728, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MTEX"}
