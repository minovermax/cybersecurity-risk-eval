{"cik": "1389050", "company": "Archrock, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs described in \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d this 2019 Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of the Elite Acquisition as and when expected, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn August 1, 2019, we completed the Elite Acquisition whereby we acquired from Elite Compression substantially all of its assets, liabilities and workforce for aggregate consideration of $214.0 million cash and 21.7 million shares of Archrock common stock. See Note 4 (\u201cBusiness Transactions\u201d) to our Financial Statements for further details of this transaction.\nWe now operate a larger combined organization and the difficulties associated with integrating the acquired assets, infrastructure and personnel into our existing operations may require additional time or expense. Our and Elite Compression\u2019s employees may also be uncertain about their future roles within Archrock subsequent to the completion of the Elite Acquisition, which could lead to departures and increased expenses related to hiring and training new employees. Further, we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from the Elite Acquisition. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the acquired business or assets may perform at levels below the levels we anticipated at the time of acquiring such business or assets due to factors beyond our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Elite Acquisition will deliver the benefits anticipated by us, and any failure to create such benefits may result in a negative impact to, or material adverse effect on, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Elite Acquisition resulted in our dependence on Hilcorp for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of business with Hilcorp or the inability or failure of Hilcorp to meet its payment obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nIn connection with the Elite Acquisition, Elite Compression\u2019s contract operations services agreements transferred to us and we expect that Hilcorp, the primary customer of Elite Compression, will account for a significant portion of our future revenue.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Hilcorp accounted for 3%, 1% and 1% of our revenue, respectively. With the closing of the Elite Acquisition, we estimate that Hilcorp will become one of our most significant customers. Any loss of business from Hilcorp, unless offset by additional contract compression services revenue from other customers, or the inability or failure of Hilcorp to meet its payment obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFollowing the closing of the Elite Acquisition, an affiliate of Hilcorp now holds a significant portion of our common stock, and Hilcorp\u2019s interest as an equity holder may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders or our noteholders.\nIn connection with the closing of the Elite Acquisition, JDH Capital, an affiliate of Hilcorp, received 21.7 million shares of our common stock, representing 14.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. As long as JDH Capital, together with affiliates of Hilcorp, owns at least 7.5% of our outstanding common stock, it will have the right to nominate one director to our Board of Directors. Given its ownership level and board representation, JDH Capital may have some influence over our operations and strategic direction and may have interests that conflict with the interests of other equity and debt holders.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our tax provision or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use any NOLs generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if our \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code, including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An ownership change can occur as a result of a public offering of our common stock, as well as through secondary market purchases of our common stock and certain types of reorganization transactions. We have experienced ownership changes, which may result in an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs (and certain other losses and/or credits) equal to the equity value of our stock immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal income tax liability, which would negatively impact the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to our stockholders and our financial condition.\nWhile we paid quarterly dividends of $0.132 per share of common stock with respect to the first and second quarters of 2019 and $0.145 per share with respect to the third and fourth quarters of 2019, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future.\nWe paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.132 per share of common stock with respect to the first and second quarters of 2019 and $0.145 per share with respect to the third and fourth quarters of 2019. We cannot provide assurance that we will, at any time in the future, again generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend or that our Board of Directors would determine to use any such surplus or our net profits to pay a dividend.\nFuture dividends may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe availability of surplus or net profits, which in turn depend on the performance of our business and operating subsidiaries, including the Partnership;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership;\n\u2022\nour debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance our debt in the future or borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nour future capital requirements, including to fund our operating expenses and other working capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe rates we charge for our services;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our services;\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of our customers;\n\u2022\nour level of operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. federal, state and local income tax laws or corporate laws.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in any particular amounts or at all in the future. A decision not to pay dividends or a reduction in our dividend payments in the future could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe depend on distributions from the Partnership to meet our capital needs and pay dividends to our stockholders.\nTo generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, fund our business and pay dividends, we depend heavily on cash distributions from the Partnership. As our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Partnership is a significant cash-generating asset for us. As a result, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of the Partnership to make distributions. Applicable law and contractual restrictions, including restrictions in the Partnership\u2019s debt instruments and partnership agreement and the rights of the creditors of the Partnership that would often be superior to our interests in the Partnership, may negatively impact our ability to obtain such distributions from our subsidiaries. A decline in the Partnership\u2019s business or revenues or increases in its expenses, principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments, working capital requirements or other cash needs could impair the Partnership\u2019s ability to make cash distributions at the Partnership\u2019s current distribution rate. A reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership would reduce the amount of cash available to us for payment of dividends, which could limit our ability to pay cash dividends at our current rate or at all, and would also reduce the amount of cash available to us for the payment of debt we may incur in the future and for the funding of our business requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Partnership has a substantial amount of debt that could limit our and the Partnership\u2019s ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2019 the Partnership had $1.8 billion in outstanding debt obligations, net of unamortized debt discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs. Many factors, including factors beyond our and the Partnership\u2019s control, may affect our ability to make payments on the Partnership\u2019s outstanding indebtedness. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nThe Partnership\u2019s substantial debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences. For example, these commitments could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are based upon variable interest rates and a portion can adjust based on our and the Partnership\u2019s credit statistics;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to incur indebtedness in the future.\nCovenants in the Partnership Debt Agreements may impair our and the Partnership\u2019s ability to operate our respective businesses.\nThe Partnership Debt Agreements, including the indenture dated as of March 21, 2019 and the indenture dated as of December 20, 2019, pursuant to which we guarantee the 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes on a senior unsecured basis, contain various covenants with which we or certain of our subsidiaries or the Partnership must comply, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of proceeds from borrowings, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, acquisitions, making loans, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making dividends or distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. The Partnership Debt Agreements also contain various covenants requiring mandatory prepayments from the net cash proceeds of certain asset transfers. In addition, if as of any date the Partnership has cash and cash equivalents (other than proceeds from a debt or equity issuance in the 30 days prior to such date reasonably expected to be used to fund an acquisition permitted under the Credit Facility) in excess of $50 million, then such excess amount will be used to pay down outstanding borrowings of a corresponding amount under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility is also subject to financial covenants, including the following ratios, as defined in its agreement:\n------\n(1)\nSubject to a temporary increase to 5.5 to 1.0 for any quarter during which an acquisition satisfying certain thresholds is completed and for the two quarters immediately following such quarter.\nIf the Partnership was to anticipate non-compliance with these financial ratios, the Partnership may take actions to maintain compliance with them. These actions include reductions in its general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures or the payment of cash distributions. Any of these measures, including a reduction in the amount of cash distributions we receive from the Partnership, may reduce the amount of cash available for payment of dividends and the funding of our business requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flows or the price of our common stock.\nThe breach of any of the covenants under the Partnership Debt Agreements, including the Partnership\u2019s financial covenants, could result in a default under the Partnership Debt Agreements, which could cause indebtedness under the Partnership Debt Agreements to become due and payable. If the repayment obligations under the Partnership Debt Agreements were to be accelerated, the Partnership may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms and the Partnership\u2019s financial position would be materially adversely affected. A material adverse effect on the Partnership\u2019s assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations, that, taken as a whole, impacts the Partnership\u2019s ability to perform the obligations under the Partnership Debt Agreements could lead to a default under those agreements. Further, a default under one or more of the Partnership Debt Agreements would trigger cross-default provisions under the other Partnership Debt Agreements, which would accelerate the Partnership\u2019s obligation to repay the indebtedness under those agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Partnership was in compliance with all covenants under the Partnership Debt Agreements.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations, including the Partnership\u2019s senior notes and the Credit Facility.\nRegulators and law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are conducting civil and criminal investigations into whether the banks that contributed to the BBA in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR may have been under-reporting or otherwise manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR. A number of BBA member banks have entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to this alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Actions by the BBA or any other administrator of LIBOR, regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, the phasing out of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. As a result, LIBOR may be discontinued by 2021. Furthermore, in the U.S., efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates that could replace LIBOR include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether any such changes will occur, whether LIBOR will be phased out or any such alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR will be enacted in the United Kingdom, the U.S. or elsewhere or the effect that any such changes, phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms, if they occur, would have on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations, including the Partnership\u2019s senior notes and the Credit Facility. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including the Partnership\u2019s senior notes, as well as the terms of the Credit Facility and any interest rate swaps or other derivative agreements to which we are a party. Reform of, or the replacement or phasing out of, LIBOR and proposed regulation of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may materially adversely affect the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our current or future debt obligations, including the Partnership\u2019s senior notes and the Credit Facility. In addition, even if we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments for purposes of managing our interest rate exposure, our hedging strategies may not be effective as a result of the replacement or phasing out of LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d and we may incur substantial losses as a result.\nWe may be unable to access the capital and credit markets or borrow on affordable terms to obtain additional capital that we may require.\nHistorically, we have financed acquisitions, operating expenditures and capital expenditures with a combination of cash provided by operating and financing activities. However, to the extent we are unable to finance our operating expenditures, capital expenditures, scheduled interest and debt repayments and any future dividends with net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Credit Facility, we may require additional capital. Periods of instability in the capital and credit markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular) could limit our ability to access these markets to raise debt or equity capital on affordable terms or to obtain additional financing. Among other things, our lenders may seek to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity at favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to us. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or if we are not successful in raising capital within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to grow or maintain our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and production activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. Additionally, some of our midstream customers may provide their gathering, transportation and related services to a limited number of companies in the oil and gas production business. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending for our products and services, which may result in their cancellation of contracts, the cancellation or delay of scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression equipment, their determination not to enter into new natural gas compression service contracts or their determination to cancel or delay orders for our services. Furthermore, the loss by our midstream customers of their key customers could reduce demand for their services and result in a deterioration of their financial condition, which would in turn decrease their demand for our services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our services. Reduced demand for our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer.\nThe loss of our business with Williams Partners or the inability or failure of Williams Partners to meet its payment obligations may adversely affect our and the Partnership\u2019s financial results, which could limit the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution to us.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Williams Partners accounted for 8%, 11% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue during these years.\nThere is no guarantee that, upon the expiration of the Partnership\u2019s existing services agreements with Williams Partners, Williams Partners will choose to renew these existing services agreements or enter into similar agreements with the Partnership. The loss of business with Williams Partners, unless offset by additional contract compression services revenue from other customers, or the inability or failure of Williams Partners to meet its payment obligations under contractual arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to us, and on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay cash dividends.\nThe loss of any of our most significant customers would result in a decline in our revenue and cash available to pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nOur five most significant customers collectively accounted for approximately 25%, 26% and 29% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our services are provided to these customers pursuant to contract compression services agreements, which typically have an initial term of 12 to 60 months and continue thereafter until terminated by either party with 30 days\u2019 advance notice. The loss of all or even a portion of the services we provide to these customers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities following the Spin-off.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Exterran Corporation that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Exterran Holdings consolidated U.S. federal and state tax reporting group between us and Exterran Corporation. If Exterran Corporation is unable to pay any prior period taxes related to these consolidated U.S. federal and state tax filings for which it is responsible, we would be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate-level taxable gain to us under Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership, by vote or value, of shares of our stock, Exterran Corporation\u2019s stock or the stock of a successor either occurring as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-off.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Exterran Corporation, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the Spin-off from being tax-free.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the tax matters agreement also may provide that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on us or any of our affiliates as a result of the failure of the Spin-off to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the Spin-off by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our shareholders.\nMany of our contract operations services contracts have short initial terms and are cancelable on short notice after the initial term, and we cannot be sure that such contracts will be extended or renewed after the end of the initial contractual term. Any such nonrenewals, or renewals at reduced rates or the loss of contracts with any significant customer could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe length of our contract operations services contracts with customers varies based on operating conditions and customer needs. Our initial contract terms typically are not long enough to enable us to recoup the cost of the equipment we utilize to provide contract operations services and these contracts are typically cancelable on short notice after the initial term. We cannot be sure that a substantial number of these contracts will be extended or renewed by our customers or that any of our customers will continue to contract with us. The inability to negotiate extensions or renew a substantial portion of our contract operations services contracts, the renewal of such contracts at reduced rates, the inability to contract for additional services with our customers or the loss of all or a significant portion of our services contracts with any significant customer could lead to a reduction in revenue and net income and could require us to record asset impairments. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases. With respect to our suppliers of newly-fabricated compression equipment specifically, we occasionally experience long lead times, and therefore may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. If we are unable to purchase compression equipment (or other integral equipment, materials and services) from third party suppliers, we may be unable to retain existing customers or compete for new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome equipment, materials and services used in our business are obtained from a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, inferior quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of such equipment, materials and services in a timely manner. Additionally, we occasionally experience long lead times from our suppliers of newly-fabricated compression equipment and may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these suppliers could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of such equipment, materials and services could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to purchase compression equipment in particular on a timely basis to meet the demands of our customers, our existing customers may terminate their contractual relationships with us, or we may not be able to compete for business from new or existing customers, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to fund purchases of additional compression equipment could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may not be able to maintain or grow our asset and customer base unless we have access to sufficient capital to purchase additional compression equipment. Cash flow from our operations and availability under our Credit Facility may not provide us with sufficient cash to fund our capital expenditure requirements, including any funding requirements related to acquisitions. Our ability to grow our asset and customer base could be impacted by limits on our ability to access additional capital.\nIf we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth could be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make accretive acquisitions. If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions either because we are (i) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (ii) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or (iii) outbid by competitors, then our future growth and ability to maintain distributions could be limited. Furthermore, even if we make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations per unit.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nan inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about the cash generated or anticipated to be generated by the business acquired or the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nunforeseen operating difficulties; and\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and we will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our future funds and other resources. In addition, competition from other buyers could reduce our acquisition opportunities or cause us to pay a higher price than we might otherwise pay.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, tax audits, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us and require material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, tax audits, litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. See Part I Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 26 (\u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d) to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain legal proceedings to which we are a party.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur business is highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to more quickly adapt to technological changes within our industry and changes in economic and market conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations service contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the compression services business. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or fabricate new compressors that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may purchase and operate their own compression fleets in lieu of using our natural gas compression services. We also may not be able to take advantage of certain opportunities or make certain investments because of our debt levels and our other obligations. Any of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases due to our variable rate debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, after taking into consideration interest rate swaps, we had $113.0 million of outstanding indebtedness that was effectively subject to variable interest rates. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing the funds available for capital investment, operations or other purposes. A 1% increase in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2019 would result in an annual increase in our interest expense of $1.1 million. In addition, a substantial portion of the Partnership\u2019s cash flow must be used to service its debt obligations. Any increase in the Partnership\u2019s interest expense could reduce the amount of cash the Partnership has available for distribution to us and as a result negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. Our insurance coverage includes property damage, general liability and commercial automobile liability and other coverage we believe is appropriate. Additionally, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. We are also self-insured for property damage to our offshore assets. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not realize the intended benefits of our recent technology transformation project, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we began a process and technology transformation project that will, among other things, upgrade or replace our existing ERP, supply chain and inventory management systems and expand the remote monitoring capabilities of our compression fleet. By using technology to make our systems and processes more efficient, we intend to lower our internal costs and improve our profitability over time. However, the implementation of the technology transformation project requires capital and other resources. We expensed $6.3 million in 2019 related to this project, and we anticipate that the project will continue to require significant resources and will result in increased SG&A expense and capital expenditures for the implementation of new technologies in 2020. Further, we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from the technology transformation project. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThreats of cyber-attacks or terrorism could affect our business.\nWe may be threatened by problems such as cyber-attacks, computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our assets may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to service our customers. We may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nU.S. federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect demand for our contract operations services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers do. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nFor example, at the U.S. federal level, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act and proposed regulations under the CWA governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. On March 26, 2015, the BLM released a final rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. The final rule never went into effect due to pending litigation and on December 28, 2017, the BLM announced that it had rescinded the 2015 final rule, in part citing a review that found that 32 of the 32 states with federal oil and gas leases have regulations that already address hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new or more stringent U.S. federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our contract operations services, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew regulations, proposed regulations and proposed modifications to existing regulations under the CAA, if implemented, could result in increased compliance costs.\nOn June 3, 2016, the EPA issued final regulations amending the NSPS for the oil and natural gas source category and applying to sources of emissions of methane and VOC from certain processes, activities and equipment that is constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Specifically, the regulation contains both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not previously covered by the NSPS, such as fugitive emissions from compressor stations and pneumatic pumps and methane standards for certain emission sources that are already regulated for VOC, such as equipment leaks at natural gas processing plants. The amendments also establish methane standards for a subset of equipment that the current NSPS regulates, including reciprocating compressors and pneumatic controllers, and extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment. In June 2017, the EPA proposed and took public comment on a two-year stay of the fugitive emissions requirements, well site pneumatic standards and closed vent certification. The EPA sought additional comment in November 2017 in support of the proposed rule, but has not finalized the two-year stay. In October 2018 and August 2019, the EPA proposed deregulatory amendments to the 2016 rule intended to streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements and decrease the burden of compliance. The EPA has not yet issued a final rule based on either proposal. At this time, we do not believe that if finalized these rules will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn November 18, 2016, the BLM published final rules to reduce venting and flaring on federal and tribal lands. The rules set forth some novel requirements regarding leak detection inspections at compressor stations and imposed requirements to reduce emissions from pneumatic controllers and pumps, among other things. In December 2017, the BLM finalized suspension of certain requirements of the November 2016 final rule until January 2019. In September 2018, the BLM finalized a rule rescinding the novel requirements pertaining to waste-minimization plans, gas-capture percentages, well drilling, well completion and related operations, pneumatic controllers, pneumatic diaphragm pumps, storage vessels and leak detection and repair. The BLM also revised other provisions related to venting and flaring. California, New Mexico and various environmental groups filed a lawsuit challenging the September 2018 final rule, which is still pending.\nOn October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a new NAAQS ozone standard of 70 ppb, which is a reduction from the 75 ppb standard set in 2008. This new standard became effective on December 28, 2015, and the EPA completed designating attainment/non-attainment regions under the revised ozone standard in 2018. In November 2016, the EPA proposed an implementation rule for the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard, but the agency has yet to issue a final implementation rule. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. By law, the EPA must review each NAAQS every five years. In December 2018, the EPA announced that it was retaining without significant revision the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard. The EPA has asked for information related to adverse effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of NAAQS and is considering re-evaluating the extent to which the EPA can or should consider levels of background ozone when choosing a standard. The EPA expects to conclude the review by October 2020 as required by law. At this time, however, we cannot predict whether state implementation of the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard or the 2020 NAAQS ozone standard would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2011, the TCEQ finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase air emissions-related requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule established new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, and the lower emissions standards will become applicable between 2020 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. A number of other states where our engines are operated have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations that could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements for engines, some of which could entail material costs to comply. At this time, however, we cannot predict whether any such rules would require us to incur material costs.\nNew environmental regulations and proposals similar to these, when finalized, and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment or the adoption of other environmental protection measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. From time to time, as part of our operations, including newly acquired operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various states in which we operate.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with. In addition, certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate, on behalf of a specific customer, petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units, all of which may impose additional compliance and permitting obligations.\nWe conduct operations at numerous facilities in a wide variety of locations across the continental U.S. The operations at many of these facilities require environmental permits or other authorizations. Additionally, natural gas compressors at many of our customers\u2019 facilities require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation. These permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nWe routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties used by us to provide contract operations services or inactive compression storage or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation and monitoring requirements under environmental laws and regulations.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased compliance costs.\nThe U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive federal climate legislation will become law in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives continue to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. Almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our gas-fired compressors could become subject to greenhouse gas-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.\nIndependent of Congress, the EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. The EPA has adopted rules requiring many facilities, including petroleum and natural gas systems, to inventory and report their greenhouse gas emissions. These reporting obligations were triggered for one site we operated in 2019.\nIn addition, the EPA rules provide air permitting requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The requirement for large sources of greenhouse gas emissions to obtain and comply with permits will affect some of our and our customers\u2019 largest new or modified facilities going forward, but is not expected to cause us to incur material costs.\nAt the international level, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which resulted in an agreement intended to nationally determine their contributions and set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. While the Agreement did not impose direct requirements on emitters, national plans to meet its pledge could have resulted in new regulatory requirements. In November 2019, however, President Trump formally announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement with an effective exit date expected in November 2020. The U.S.\u2019s adherence to the exit process is uncertain and the terms on which the U.S. may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nAlthough it is not currently possible to predict how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation or regulation promulgated by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere can change the climate in a manner that results in significant weather-related effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other such events. If any of those results occur, it could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for and responding to them.", "PERMNO": 92245, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "AROC"}
