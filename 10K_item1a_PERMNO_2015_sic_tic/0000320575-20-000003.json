While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may negatively impact our business, financial condition or operating results.\nSet forth below are various risks and uncertainties that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Chapter 11 Proceedings\n\u2022\nOn March 1, 2020, Pioneer Energy Services and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions commencing the Chapter 11 Cases under the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases and the Restructuring may have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock and ultimately are expected to result in the cancellation and discharge of our securities, including our common stock. The Plan governs distributions to and the recoveries of holders of our securities.\nIn 2019, we engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure our indebtedness in private transactions. These restructuring efforts led to the execution of the RSA and commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on March 1, 2020.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and profitability of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our clients and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nOther significant risks include or relate to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession;\n\u2022\ndelays in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate the Plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our shareholders, clients, suppliers, service providers, and employees;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related advisory costs to effect our reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with clients, suppliers, service providers, employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing;\n\u2022\nBankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases, views and objections of creditors and other parties in interest that may make it difficult to consummate a plan in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a U.S. trustee or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (\u201cChapter 7\u201d);\n\u2022\nthird-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our ability to consummate the Plan; and\n\u2022\nthe potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on our liquidity and results of operations.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\n\u2022\nDelays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThe RSA contemplates the consummation of the Plan through an orderly prepackaged plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the Plan. A prolonged Chapter 11 proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with clients, suppliers, service providers, and employees, among other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan (or any other plan of reorganization). If we are unable to consummate the Plan, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.\nIn addition, the occurrence of the effective date of the Plan is subject to certain conditions and requirements that may not be satisfied or waived.\n\u2022\nThe Plan may not become effective.\nThe Plan may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (some of which are beyond our control). There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or waived and, therefore, that the Plan will become effective and that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases as contemplated by the Plan. If the effective date of the Plan is delayed, we may not have sufficient cash available to operate our business. In that case, we may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the cost of consummating the Plan. There is no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the Plan. The terms of any such amendment are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays to the Chapter 11 Cases.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan or may have to modify the terms of the Plan.\nEven if the Plan is approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote (a \u201cVoting Class\u201d), the Bankruptcy Court, which, as a court of equity, may exercise substantial discretion and may choose not to confirm the Plan. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129 requires, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization for us, and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if we, the debtors, liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.\nConfirmation of the Plan will also be subject to certain conditions. These conditions may not be met and there can be no assurance that the Consenting Creditors will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate changes to the Plan. Any such modifications could result in less favorable treatment than the treatment currently anticipated to be included in the Plan based upon the agreed terms of the RSA. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property (including the new common stock) to the class affected by the modification of a lesser value than currently anticipated to be included in the Plan or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Plan. Changes to the Plan may also delay the confirmation of the Plan and our emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in, among other things, incurred costs and expenses to the estates of the debtors.\n\u2022\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan, or any other plan of reorganization, is consummated, we may continue to face a number of risks, such as further deterioration in commodity prices or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our services and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan, or any other plan of reorganization, will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced through a plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our access to additional financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\n\u2022\nThe Plan or another plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, we may not be able to successfully execute such plan.\nThe Plan or any other plan of reorganization that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our business and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain clients\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions and conditions of the oil and gas industry. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business.\nIn addition, the Plan or any other plan of reorganization, will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts are even more speculative than normal, because they involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of our plan of reorganization.\n\u2022\nOur cash flows may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations and our capital expenditures requires a significant amount of cash. Our current principal sources of liquidity include the available borrowing capacity under our DIP Facility and cash flow generated from operations. If our cash flow from operations decreases, we may not have the ability to expend the capital necessary to maintain or improve our current operations, negatively impacting our future revenues.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. Although we expect the Chapter 11 Cases to be completed as quickly as 60 days based on the milestones in the RSA, we may not be able to comply with the covenants of our DIP Facility and our cash on hand and cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of our DIP Facility agreements, (ii) our ability to comply with\nthe terms and conditions of any cash collateral order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iv) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (v) our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan or other alternative restructuring transaction and (vi) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions or with budget, liquidity, or other covenants imposed by the agreements governing our DIP Facility. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the terms of the DIP Facility that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants of the DIP Facility will include general affirmative covenants, as well as negative covenants such as prohibiting us from incurring or permitting debt, investments, liens or dispositions unless specifically permitted. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply, or obtain a waiver in the event we cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the DIP Facility and permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans and otherwise exercise remedies allowable by the agreements governing the DIP Facility.\n\u2022\nTermination of our exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances could result in competing plans of reorganization, which could have less favorable terms or result in significant litigation and expenses.\nWe currently have the exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan through June 28, 2020, and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances of any such plan through August 28, 2020. Such deadlines may be extended from time to time \u201cfor cause\u201d (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. However, it is also possible that (a) parties in interest could seek to shorten or terminate such exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods \u201cfor cause\u201d (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) or (b) that such periods could expire without extension.\nAlthough we expect the Chapter 11 Cases to be completed as quickly as 60 days based on the milestones in the RSA, if our exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods expire or are terminated, other parties in interest will be permitted to file alternative plans of reorganization. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate us continuing as a going concern, us being broken up, us or our assets being acquired by a third party, us being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. There can be no assurances that recoveries under any such alternative plan would be as favorable to creditors as the Plan. In addition, the proposal of competing plans of reorganization may entail significant litigation and significantly increase the expenses of administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, which could deplete creditor recoveries under any plan.\n\u2022\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, which may be volatile.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to our historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to the Plan. We expect we will be required to adopt the fresh start accounting rules, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be different from historical trends.\n\u2022\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The Plan will result in the cancellation of our common stock.\nUnder the Plan, all existing equity interests in the Company will be extinguished, although holders of equity interests will be receiving some recovery under the Plan if the class of equityholders votes in favor of the Plan. Amounts invested by the holders of our common stock will not be recoverable and such securities will have no value. Trading prices for\nour common stock bear no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in our existing common stock.\n\u2022\nIf the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement. If the RSA is terminated as to all parties thereto, each of the parties thereto will be released from its obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new Plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Pioneer RSA Parties as contemplated by the RSA.\n\u2022\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in the Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Court provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to March 1, 2020 or before consummation of the Plan (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Plan and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Plan. Any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to the Plan could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\n\u2022\nThe Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile we operate our business as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and, in some cases, the Consenting Creditors, prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with the creditors\u2019 committee (if any) and other parties-in-interest and one or more hearings. The creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions.\nThis process may delay major transactions and limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to adapt to changing market or industry conditions or to take advantage of certain opportunities. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe to be beneficial to us.\n\u2022\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management and will impact how our business is conducted, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of our management\u2019s time and attention and leave them with less time to devote to the operation of our business. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience employee attrition, and our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOn the effective date of the Plan, the composition of our board of directors will change substantially.\nUnder the Plan, the composition of our board of directors will change substantially. Pursuant to the Plan, our new board of directors will be appointed by the required consenting noteholders under the RSA in consultation with our management, and the numbers of directors will also be determined by the required consenting noteholders. Our Chief Executive Officer will be a member of the board of directors. Accordingly, almost all of our board members will be new to the Company. Any new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the board of directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.\n\u2022\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nRisks Relating to the Oil and Gas Industry\n\u2022\nWe derive all our revenues from companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.\nAs a provider of contract land drilling services and oil and gas production services, our business depends on the level of exploration and production activity in the geographic markets where we operate. The oil and gas exploration and production industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities.\nOil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. Oil and gas prices have been volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Worldwide political, economic, and military events as well as natural disasters have contributed to oil and gas price volatility historically, and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and gas prices, including:\n\u2022\nthe worldwide supply and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\navailable pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nthe levels of oil and gas storage;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas exploration and production companies to raise capital;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nactions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which we refer to as OPEC;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, both domestic and foreign;\n\u2022\ndomestic or global health concerns, including the outbreak of contagious or pandemic diseases, such as the recent coronavirus;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022\nweather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development and production of their national reserves, or their investments in oil and gas reserves located in other countries; and\n\u2022\nthe price of foreign imports of oil and gas.\nAdditionally, the above factors can also be affected by technological advances affecting energy consumption and the supply and demand within the market for renewable energy resources.\n\u2022\nOil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly impact the level of worldwide drilling and production services activities.\nOil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly impact the level of worldwide drilling and production services activities. Reduced demand for oil and natural gas generally results in lower prices for these commodities and often impacts the economics of planned drilling projects and ongoing production projects, resulting in the curtailment, reduction, delay or postponement of such projects for an indeterminate period of time. When drilling and production activity and spending declines, both dayrates and utilization historically decline as well.\nIn late 2014, oil prices worldwide began to drop significantly and as a result, our clients significantly reduced both their operating and capital expenditures during 2015 and 2016, which adversely affected our business. In 2017 and 2018, our clients modestly increased their spending as compared to 2016 levels, and our business trended upward as a result. However, in late 2018, oil prices again began to decline and despite some improvement in early 2019, have since languished without significant improvement. As a result, oil and gas exploration and production companies have continued to limit their drilling programs and production spending on existing wells, thereby reducing demand for our services.\nAdditionally, because our business depends on the level of spending by our clients, we are also affected by our clients\u2019 ability to access the capital markets. After several consecutive years without significant improvement in commodity prices, many exploration and production companies have limited their spending to a level which can be supported by net operating cash flows alone, as access to the capital markets through debt or equity financings has become more challenging in our industry.\nIf the reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, continues or worsens, it could materially and adversely affect us further by negatively impacting:\n\u2022\nour revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022\nthe fair market value of our drilling and production services fleets;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or obtain additional debt financing;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business or make acquisitions, and the cost of that capital;\n\u2022\nthe collectability of our receivables; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain skilled operations personnel.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\u2022\nReduced demand for or excess capacity of drilling services or production services could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability in the future will depend on many factors, but largely on pricing and utilization rates for our drilling and production services. A reduction in the demand for our equipment and services or an increase in the supply of comparable equipment in our industry or any particular regional market would likely decrease the pricing and utilization rates for our affected service offerings, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The continuing trend toward longer lateral wellbores and the enhanced efficiency of the equipment in our industry, in combination with current commodity prices and more disciplined spending by exploration and production companies, has contributed to an oversupply of equipment in our industry, declining rig counts and dayrates, and reduced completion activity.\n\u2022\nWe operate in a highly competitive, fragmented industry in which price competition could reduce our profitability.\nWe encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors and other oilfield service companies. Our primary market areas are highly fragmented and competitive. The fact that drilling and production services equipment are mobile\nand can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry and may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. Contract drilling companies and other oilfield service companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. If demand for drilling or production services improves in a region where we operate, our competitors might respond by moving in suitable rigs and production services equipment from other regions. An influx of equipment from other regions could rapidly intensify competition, reduce profitability and make any improvement in demand for our services short-lived.\nMost drilling services contracts and production services contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. In addition to pricing and equipment availability, we believe the following factors are also important to our clients in determining which drilling services or production services provider to select:\n\u2022\nthe type, capability and condition of each of the competing drilling rigs, well servicing rigs, wireline units and coiled tubing units;\n\u2022\nthe mobility and efficiency of the equipment;\n\u2022\nthe quality of service and experience of the crews;\n\u2022\nthe reputation and safety record of the company providing the services;\n\u2022\nthe offering of integrated and/or ancillary services; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to provide drilling and production services equipment adaptable to, and personnel familiar with, new technologies and drilling and production techniques.\nWhile we must be competitive in our pricing, our competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of our equipment, our safety record, our ability to offer ancillary services, the experience of our crews and the quality of service we provide to differentiate us from our competitors. This strategy is less effective when lower demand for drilling and production services intensifies price competition and makes it more difficult for us to compete on the basis of factors other than price. In all of the markets in which we compete, an oversupply of drilling rigs or production services equipment generally causes greater price competition and reduced profitability.\n\u2022\nWe face competition from many competitors with greater resources.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to:\n\u2022\nbetter withstand industry downturns;\n\u2022\ncompete more effectively on the basis of price and technology;\n\u2022\nbetter attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u2022\nbuild new rigs or acquire and refurbish existing rigs and place them into service more quickly than us in periods of high drilling demand.\n\u2022\nTechnological advancements and trends in our industry also affect the demand for certain types of equipment, and can affect the overall demand for the services our industry provides.\nTechnological advancements and trends in our industry also affect the demand for certain types of equipment, and can affect the overall demand for the services our industry provides. Enhanced directional and horizontal drilling techniques have allowed exploration and production operators to drill increasingly longer lateral wellbores which enable higher hydrocarbon production per well and reduce the overall number of wells needed to achieve the desired production. The trend in our industry toward fewer, but longer, lateral wellbores has led to an overall reduction in drilling and completion activity and demand for the equipment in our industry that is more heavily weighted toward the more specialized equipment available, such as high-spec drilling rigs, higher horsepower well servicing rigs equipped with taller masts, larger diameter coiled tubing units, and other higher power ancillary equipment, which is needed to drill, complete, and provide services to the full length of the wellbore.\nOur domestic drilling and production services fleets are highly capable and designed for operation in today\u2019s long lateral, pad-oriented environment. Although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced technologies for drilling and production services equipment, changes in technology or improvements in our competitors\u2019 equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to keep our equipment competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of major clients, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain relationships with these clients, or if their demand for our services decreases.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of major clients. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our drilling and production services to our top three clients accounted for approximately 18% and 20%, respectively, of our revenue. The loss of one or more of our major clients, or their decrease in demand for our services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a detail of our three largest clients as a percentage of our total revenues during the last two fiscal years, see Item 1 - \u201cBusiness\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nCertain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our clients without penalty and/or with little or no notice.\nSome of our current drilling contracts, and some drilling contracts that we may enter into in the future, may include terms allowing our clients to terminate the contracts without cause, with little or no prior notice and/or without penalty or early termination payments. The likelihood that a client may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness.\nIn periods of extended market weakness, our clients may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts, may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, or may seek to renegotiate contract dayrates and terms in light of depressed market conditions. During depressed market conditions, as a result of commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond our control, a client may no longer want or need a drilling rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling rig at a lower dayrate. For these reasons, clients may seek to renegotiate the terms of our existing drilling contracts, terminate our contracts without justification, leverage their termination rights in an effort to renegotiate contract terms, or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our contracts.\nOur clients may also seek to terminate contracts for cause, such as the loss of or major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. If we experience operational problems or if our equipment fails to function properly and cannot be repaired promptly, our clients will not be able to engage in drilling operations and may have the right to terminate the contracts. If equipment is not timely delivered to a client or does not pass acceptance testing, a client may in certain circumstances have the right to terminate the contract.\nIn the event of a cancellation, the payment of a termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Additionally, the early termination of a contract may result in a drilling rig or other equipment being idle for an extended period of time. The cancellation or renegotiation of a number of our contracts could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022\nOur operations involve operating hazards, which, if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in exploration and production activity, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nblowouts;\n\u2022\ncratering;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\nloss of well control;\n\u2022\ncollapse of the borehole;\n\u2022\ndamaged or lost drilling equipment; and\n\u2022\ndamage or loss from natural disasters.\nAny of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from, among other things:\n\u2022\nsuspension of operations;\n\u2022\ndamage to, or destruction of, our property and equipment and that of others;\n\u2022\npersonal injury and loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations through which we drill; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental damage.\nWe seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage. However, some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Those risks include, among other things, pollution liability in excess of relatively low limits. Depending on competitive conditions and other factors, we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our clients. However, clients who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a client to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.\n\u2022\nWe could be adversely affected if shortages of equipment, supplies or personnel occur.\nFrom time to time, there have been shortages of drilling and production services equipment and supplies during periods of high demand, which we believe could recur. Additionally, trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries could also affect the supply of equipment and supplies which are needed in our operations. Shortages could result in increased prices for equipment or supplies that we may be unable to pass on to clients and could substantially lengthen the delivery times for equipment and supplies. Any significant delays in our obtaining equipment or supplies could limit our operations and jeopardize our relations with clients and could delay and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts for our rigs. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy of constructing drilling rigs during periods of peak demand requires that we maintain an adequate supply of drilling rig components to complete our rig building program. Our suppliers may be unable to provide us the needed drilling rig components if their manufacturing sources are unable to fulfill their commitments.\nOur operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to achieve proper operational results. As a result, our operations depend, to a considerable extent, on the continuing availability of such personnel. From time to time, shortages of qualified personnel have occurred in our industry. Additionally, we may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. If we should suffer any material loss of personnel or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment, our operations could be materially adversely affected. A significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce, increases in wage rates, or both. The occurrence of either of these events for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur international operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties not generally encountered in our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties not generally encountered in our U.S. operations which include, among potential others:\n\u2022\nrisks of war, terrorism, civil unrest and kidnapping of employees;\n\u2022\nemployee strikes, work stoppages, labor disputes and other slowdowns;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of our assets;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of contracts;\n\u2022\nforeign taxation;\n\u2022\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital due to laws limiting the right and ability of foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies;\n\u2022\nchanging political conditions and changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment;\n\u2022\ntrade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries;\n\u2022\nconcentration of clients;\n\u2022\nregional economic downturns;\n\u2022\nthe overlap of different tax structures;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with the assertion of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with any lack of compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange, and higher rates of inflation as compared to our domestic operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in collecting international accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\npotentially longer payment cycles.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and our code of conduct and ethics. We are subject, however, to the risk that our employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other similar laws. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\n\u2022\nOur operations are subject to various laws and governmental regulations that could restrict our future operations and increase our operating costs.\nMany aspects of our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations, including laws and regulations governing:\n\u2022\nenvironmental quality;\n\u2022\npollution control;\n\u2022\nremediation of contamination;\n\u2022\npreservation of natural resources;\n\u2022\ntransportation; and\n\u2022\nworker safety.\nEnvironment Protection. Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health and safety.\nSome of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our industry relate to the disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of those substances that can be released into the environment. Several of those laws also require removal and remedial action and other cleanup under certain circumstances, commonly regardless of fault. Our operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous wastes and/or hazardous substances. Planning, implementation and maintenance of protective measures are required to prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are also subject to these regulatory requirements. In addition, our operations are often conducted in or near ecologically sensitive areas, such as wetlands, which are subject to special protective measures and which may expose us to additional operating costs and liabilities for accidental discharges of oil, gas, drilling fluids, contaminated water or other substances, or for noncompliance with other aspects of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe federal Clean Water Act; the Oil Pollution Act; the federal Clean Air Act; the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA); regulations implementing these federal statutes (such as the \u201cNavigable Waters Protection Rule\u201d issued on January 23, 2020); and their state counterparts and similar statutes are the primary statutes that impose the requirements described above and provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \u201ccommunity right-to-know\u201d regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and report information about the hazardous materials we use\nin our operations to employees, state and local government authorities and local citizens. In addition, CERCLA, also known as the \u201cSuperfund\u201d law, and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered responsible for the release or threatened release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. These persons generally include the current owner or operator of a facility where a release has occurred, the owner or operator of a facility at the time a release occurred, and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a particular site. This liability may be joint and several. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of removal and remedial action as well as damages to natural resources. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by many environmental laws and regulations. It is also common for third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage caused by substances released into the environment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change. Failure to comply with governmental requirements or inadequate cooperation with governmental authorities could subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal action. We may also be exposed to environmental or other liabilities originating from businesses and assets which we acquired from others. Our compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination or regulatory noncompliance may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate.\nThere are a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the United States and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Among these developments at the international level is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which produced the \u201cKyoto Protocol\u201d (an internationally applied protocol, which has been ratified in Colombia, which is a location where we provide drilling services) in 1992. More recently, in December 2015, 195 countries adopted under the Framework Convention a resolution known as the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases with a goal of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C (36\u00b0F). The Paris Agreement does not establish enforceable emissions reduction targets, but countries may establish greenhouse gas reduction measures pursuant to the agreement. The agreement went into effect in November 2016. The United States ratified the Paris Agreement in September 2016. It has since notified the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but under the terms of the agreement the U.S. will remain a party until November 4, 2020.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Also, more than one-third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. There have been two multi-state organizations devoted to climate action. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is located in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. The Western Regional Climate Action Initiative once included multiple U.S. states and much of Canada, but allowance trading is now limited to only California and Quebec, with a separate trading program administered for the province of Nova Scotia.\nIn 2007, the United States Supreme Court, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d under the federal Clean Air Act. In December 2009, the EPA responded to this decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain greenhouse gases from motor vehicles contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change. Subsequently, the EPA has a number of climate change regulations, including greenhouse gas control and permitting requirements for certain large stationary sources, fuel economy standards for vehicles and emissions standards for power plants.\nSpecific to the oil and gas industry, in April 2012, the EPA issued regulations to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds, or VOC, emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. The EPA also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment at natural gas well sites, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators and pneumatic controllers. In May 2016, the EPA issued a rule to reduce methane (a greenhouse gas) and VOC emissions from additional oil and gas operations. Among other requirements, the rules impose standards for hydraulically fractured oil wells and equipment leaks at oil and gas production sites and extend certain existing standards to downstream oil and gas operations. In April 2017, the EPA granted reconsideration of aspects of this rule. In March 2018, the EPA finalized two minor amendments to the rule but also announced that it is continuing to examine other rule issues.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed climate change initiatives will be adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. Any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our clients operate and thus adversely affect demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations. Finally, we cannot predict with any certainty whether changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change will have a material impact on our operations.\nIn addition, our business depends on the demand for land drilling and production services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by tax, environmental and other laws relating to the oil and gas industry generally, by changes in those laws and by changes in related administrative regulations. It is possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our clients, or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations.\nOil and gas development restrictions are also possible due to voter initiatives. For example, in 2018, Colorado voted on Proposition 112, which would have increased drilling location setbacks from 500 feet to 2,500 feet, severely limiting access to oil and gas minerals. Although Proposition 112 was defeated, future voter initiatives are possible in certain jurisdictions. For example, at least six oil and gas ballot initiatives have already been submitted for Colorado\u2019s November ballot with some that are similar to Proposition 112 from 2018. Further, state legislators and regulators could seek to impose similar restrictions.\nOur wireline operations involve the use of radioactive isotopes along with other nuclear, electrical, acoustic, and mechanical devices. Our activities involving the use of isotopes are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and specified agencies of certain states. Additionally, we use high explosive charges for perforating casing and formations, and we use various explosive cutters to assist in wellbore cleanout. Such operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of densitometers as well as explosive charges. We have obtained these licenses and approvals when necessary and believe that we are in substantial compliance with these federal requirements.\nTransportation. Among the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier for the transportation of our own equipment and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nWorker safety. Our ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.\n\u2022\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our drilling and well servicing activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and a minor amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Federal agencies have adopted new rules, such as the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s (BLM) hydraulic fracturing rule finalized in March 2015, that impose additional requirements on the practice of hydraulic fracturing. The BLM has since rescinded much of the 2016 rule, but litigation challenging the replacement rule is pending. In October 2016, the BLM updated its rules to restrict flaring associated with the development of oil and natural gas on public lands, including through hydraulic fracturing. The BLM has since proposed rescinding portions of the rule and portions of the rule have been suspended pending the outcome of litigation concerning the rule. Additional federal regulations may also be developed. Several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to concerns regarding potential environmental and physical impacts, including groundwater and drinking water impacts, as well as whether such activities may cause earthquakes.\nThe federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of \u201cunderground injection.\u201d The EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and has developed guidance relating to such practices. In addition, repeal of the SDWA exclusion of hydraulic fracturing has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the SDWA, which would have the effect of allowing the EPA to promulgate new regulations and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing, and to require the disclosure of the chemical constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, which would make the information public via the Internet.\nScrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having completed a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. The Final Report issued by the EPA in December 2016 concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified conditions under which impacts can be more frequent or severe. In addition, in April 2012, the EPA issued the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, which require operators to significantly reduce VOC emissions through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. These new rules address emissions of various pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities by, among other things, requiring new or reworked hydraulically-fractured gas wells to control emissions through flaring or reduced emission (or \u201cgreen\u201d) completions. The rules also establish specific new requirements, which were effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants, and certain other equipment. The EPA has amended these rules several times. In May 2016, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce methane (a greenhouse gas) and VOC emissions from oil and gas operations. It is also possible that the EPA will further amend its oil and gas regulations. These rules may require a number of modifications to our clients\u2019 and our own operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in additional costs for us and our clients, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nThe EPA has also developed effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities to publicly owned treatment works (POTW). The agency\u2019s final regulations, published on June 28, 2016, prohibited any discharge of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to a POTW. The EPA was also required, pursuant to a Consent Decree with environmental groups, to reevaluate whether oil and gas wastes should continue to be exempt from being considered hazardous wastes. Although the EPA concluded in April 2019 that no changes to the existing exemption are needed, similar lawsuits could be brought in the future. The U.S. Department of the Interior has also finalized regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents (i.e. the BLM\u2019s hydraulic fracturing rule issued in March 2015) and has finalized, in October 2016, a rule to reduce flaring and venting associated with oil and gas operations on public lands. The BLM rules have since been rescinded, but it is possible that they will be reinstated through litigation.\nIn addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, that would require, with some exceptions, disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas production. Moreover, public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continued to see strong public opposition, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.\nIn June 2014, the State of New York\u2019s Court of Appeals upheld the right of individual municipalities in the State of New York to ban hydraulic fracturing using zoning restrictions. In December 2014, New York State Governor Cuomo announced that hydraulic fracturing will be permanently banned in the state. Similarly situated municipalities in other states may seek to ban or restrict resource extraction operations within their borders using zoning and/or setback restrictions, which could adversely affect the ability of resource extraction enterprises to operate in certain parts of the country, and thus adversely affect demand for our services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our clients. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our drilling and well servicing activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nOur operations are subject to cybersecurity risks.\nOur operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:\n\u2022\nloss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information (including client, supplier, or employee data);\n\u2022\ndisruption or impairment of our and our clients\u2019 business operations and safety procedures;\n\u2022\nloss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we do not have control over the information technology systems of our clients, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions may not result in the realization of savings and efficiencies, the generation of cash flow or income, or the reduction of risk as contemplated by management, and may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time and subject to any limitations set forth in our debt financing agreements, we may seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions including the sale of assets or businesses, or the pursuit of acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses. These transactions are subject to inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe use of capital for acquisitions may adversely affect our cash available for other uses;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs, assumption of liabilities or exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, assets and employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining an effective internal control environment over an acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndecreased earnings, revenues or cash flow resulting from dispositions; and\n\u2022\nincreases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties that may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may not have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions. Historically, we have funded business acquisitions and the growth of our fleets through a combination of debt and equity financing. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities or convertible securities in connection with such acquisitions. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Even if we have access to the necessary capital, we may be unable to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets.\n\u2022\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR, the London Interbank Offer Rate, as a benchmark by the end of 2021, when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. LIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. In the future, we may need to renegotiate our current debt arrangements or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Resources and Organization\n\u2022\nWe have a significant amount of debt and despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt. Our debt levels and the restrictions imposed on us by our DIP Facility may have significant consequences, including limiting our liquidity and flexibility for successfully operating our business, pursuing business opportunities, and obtaining additional financing.\nPrior to our bankruptcy filing, we were a highly leveraged company. At December 31, 2019, our total debt consists of $300 million outstanding under our Senior Notes and $175 million outstanding under our Term Loan. After our expected emergence from bankruptcy, we may continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness.\nOur level of indebtedness could prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. Because we may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to make interest and principal payments, we could be limited in our ability to:\n\u2022\nmake investments in working capital or capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nobtain additional financing that may be necessary to fund or expand our operations; and\n\u2022\nwithstand and respond to changes or events in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nThe incurrence of additional indebtedness could exacerbate the above risks and make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nWe also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our DIP Facility that, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nengage in asset sales or dispositions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with another company;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments (including acquisitions);\n\u2022\nincur or permit liens on assets; and\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or equity financing.\nThe failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause an event of default under our DIP Facility which if not waived, could result in acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness under our DIP Facility, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, whether at maturity or as a result of acceleration.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. We have in the past incurred, and may incur in the future, negative cash flows from our operating activities. Our ability to generate positive cash flows in the future will be influenced by:\n\u2022\ngeneral industry, economic and financial conditions;\n\u2022\nthe level of commodity prices in our industry and the level of demand for our services;\n\u2022\ncompetition in the markets where we operate; and\n\u2022\nother factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying capital investments, including maintenance or refurbishment of our equipment; and/or\n\u2022\nseeking to raise additional capital.\nWe may not be able to repay our debt as it comes due, or to refinance our debt on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in our DIP Facility or our New Revolver when payment obligations are no longer automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Failure to repay or to timely refinance any portion of our debt could result in a default under the terms of all our debt instruments and the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding.\nAs of March 1, 2020, we were in default under our Term Loan, Prepetition ABL Facility, and Senior Notes. Filing the Chapter 11 Cases accelerated our Term Loan, Prepetition ABL Facility, and Senior Notes obligations. Additionally, events of default under the credit agreements governing our Term Loan and Prepetition ABL Facility and the indenture governing our Senior notes have occurred and are continuing, including as a result of cross-defaults between such credit agreements and indenture. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\u2022\nOur current operations and future growth may require significant additional capital, and the amount and terms of our indebtedness could impair our ability to fund our capital requirements. The DIP Facility may be insufficient to fund our cash requirements through emergence from bankruptcy.\nOur business requires substantial capital, and we may require additional capital in the event of significant departures from our current business plan, unanticipated maintenance or capital requirements, or to pursue growth opportunities. However, additional financing may not be available on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in our debt arrangements. Failure to obtain additional financing, should the need for it develop, could impair our ability to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and meet debt service requirements, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Further, for the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, we will be subject to various additional risks including the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations, to fund the plan of reorganization and to meet future obligations, including increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and our reorganization. Further, if the transactions contemplated by the Plan are not completed such that the effective date of the Plan occurs prior to the maturity of the DIP Facility, we may need to refinance the DIP Facility. We may not be able to obtain any such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\n\u2022\nWe expect that our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes will be substantially limited as a result of transfers or issuances of our equity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income and to reduce our U.S. federal income tax liability is subject to certain governing rules and restrictions. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of such ownership change. Generally, under Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d is deemed to have occurred if one or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a company\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50% over the prior three-year period. Upon experiencing an ownership change, absent any exception allowable under Section 382, the amount of a company\u2019s net operating losses and certain other tax attributes that may be utilized to offset future taxable income will generally be subject to an annual limitation; however, the annual limitation does not limit the ability to use net operating losses in offsetting cancellation of indebtedness income pursuant to Section 108 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\nFollowing the implementation of our Plan, we expect that an \u201cownership change\u201d will be deemed to have occurred and, absent any exception allowable under Section 382, our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes will, post-emergence, be subject to substantial annual limitation, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. If we were to undergo one or more additional ownership changes subsequent to our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may become subject to further limitation.\n\u2022\nOur shares of common stock are not listed for trading on a national securities exchange and thus the market for our common stock is limited, sporadic, and volatile which may impact the value of our shares and your ability to sell your shares.\nWe are quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the trading symbol \u201cPESXQ\u201d and are not traded or listed on a national securities exchange. Investments in securities trading on the OTC Pink marketplace are generally less liquid than investments in securities trading on a national securities exchange. We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on the OTC Pink marketplace, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on the OTC Pink marketplace, or whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market.\nThis may result in limited shareholder interest, including that of institutional investors, and it may be difficult for our shareholders to sell their shares, without depressing the market price for our shares, or at all, which could further depress the trading price of our common stock. An inactive market or depressed trading price could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and thus impair our ability to enter into strategic transactions which could otherwise have been executed using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, the trading of our common stock on the OTC Pink marketplace could have other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence in us by suppliers, clients and employees.\n\u2022\nThere can be no assurance that any public market for our new common stock will exist in the future or that we will be able to obtain a listing of our new common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the OTC Markets.\nIf we are unable to obtain a listing for our new common stock on the NYSE, we will instead seek to have our new common stock quoted on the OTC Markets until such time as we are able to obtain a NYSE listing for our new common stock. However, we may not be successful in obtaining a listing of our new common stock. Furthermore, even if our new common stock is approved for listing on the NYSE or is traded on the OTC Markets, we are not certain that any trading market will develop or, if it develops, whether such trading market will be sustained.\n\u2022\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our new common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our new common stock will provide a return to our shareholders.\nWe do not intend to pay or declare any dividends on our new common stock and currently intend to retain any earnings to fund our working capital needs, reduce debt and fund growth opportunities. Any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors it deems relevant, including our financial condition and performance, cash needs, income tax consequences and restrictions imposed by the Texas Business Organizations Code and other applicable laws and by our DIP Facility and any other debt arrangements. Our DIP Facility includes provisions that generally prohibit us from paying dividends on our capital stock, including our new common stock.\n\u2022\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our new common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our new common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine; however, our issuance of preferred stock is subject to the limitations imposed on us by our debt arrangements. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our new common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our new common stock.\n\u2022\nProvisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent;\n\u2022\nprovisions dividing our board of directors into three classes elected for staggered terms; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\n\u2022\nIf we implement an enterprise resource planning system, such implementation could expose us to certain risks commonly associated with the conversion of existing data and processes to a new system.\nWe are currently in the evaluation phase of implementing a company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to upgrade, replace and integrate certain existing business, operational and financial processes and systems, upon which we rely. ERP implementations are expensive, complex and time-consuming projects that require transformations of business and finance processes in order to reap the benefits of an integrated ERP system. Due to our liquidity issues, we may not have sufficient funds to implement the ERP system. Additionally, any such project involves certain risks inherent in the conversion, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations and finance functions. Additionally, if the ERP system is not effectively implemented as planned, or the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties and are unable to effectively manage our business during or following the implementation of the ERP system, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 63335, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "PESXQ"}
