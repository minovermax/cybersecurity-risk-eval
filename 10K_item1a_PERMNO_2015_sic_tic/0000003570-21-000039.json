RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nRisk Factor Summary\nEach of the risk factors outlined below are discussed more fully following this summary:\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters\nOur operating results, cash flows and/or liquidity could be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022Our existing level of cash resources and significant debt\n\u2022History of net losses and negative operating cash flow\n\u2022Dilution of our proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects from sale of equity or equity-related securities\n\u2022Stockholder dilution upon the conversion of our convertible notes\n\u2022Failure to perform by our customers under their long-term contracts with us\n\u2022Termination of our customer contracts under certain circumstances\n\u2022Restrictions in distributions under certain circumstances by our subsidiaries\n\u2022Restrictions in agreements governing us and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness\n\u2022Use of hedging arrangements\n\u2022Certain rules and regulations could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Terminal Operations and Commercialization\nThe operations of our LNG terminals, construction of the remaining or additional Trains and the commercialization of the LNG produced could be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022Cost overruns and delays in construction, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing to pay for such costs and delays\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional funding for additional Trains\n\u2022Hurricanes or other disasters\n\u2022Failure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies\n\u2022Delays in construction leading to reduced revenues or termination of one or more of the SPAs by our customers\n\u2022Dependency on Bechtel and other contractors\n\u2022Unavailability of third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities to transport natural gas\n\u2022Inability to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under the SPAs\n\u2022Subjectivity to FERC regulation\n\u2022Pipeline safety integrity programs and repairs\n\u2022Reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, interconnecting third-party pipelines\n\u2022Loss of our right to situate our pipelines on property owned by third parties\n\u2022Inaccurate estimates for the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Liquefaction Projects\n\u2022Failure by any significant customer to perform under agreements\n\u2022Inability to contract with customers to sell LNG produced in excess of quantities committed under third-party SPAs\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Business in General\nThe operation or growth of our LNG business, including our customers, could be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022Not constructing or operating all of our proposed or additional LNG facilities or Trains beyond those currently planned\n\u2022Cyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas\n\u2022Failure of imported or exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for the United States or international markets\n\u2022Various economic and political factors\n\u2022Impediments to the transport of LNG, such as shortages of LNG vessels, or operational impacts on LNG shipping\n\u2022Security of firm pipeline transportation capacity on economic terms that is sufficient to meet our feed gas transportation requirements\n\u2022Competition based upon the international market price for LNG\n\u2022Terrorist attacks, cyber incidents or military campaigns\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nOur operations and business results could also be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022COVID-19 global pandemic and volatility in the energy markets\n\u2022Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, at one or more of our facilities\n\u2022Significant construction and operating hazards and uninsured risks\n\u2022Existing and future environmental and similar laws and governmental regulations\n\u2022Major health and safety incident relating to our business\n\u2022Increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, including changes in our senior management or other key personnel\n\u2022Lack of diversification\n\u2022Impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets\n\u2022Success of our share repurchase program\n\u2022Fluctuation in the market price of our common stock\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters\nOur existing level of cash resources and significant debt could cause us to have inadequate liquidity and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $449 million of current restricted cash, $1,126 million of available commitments under the $1.25 billion Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility (\u201cCheniere Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), $372 million of available commitments under the $2.62 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the \u201cCheniere Term Loan Facility\u201d), $767 million of available commitments under the $1.2 billion CCH Working Capital Facility (\u201cCCH Working Capital Facility\u201d), $750 million of available commitments under Cheniere Partners\u2019 credit facilities, $787 million of available commitments under the $1.2 billion Amended and Restated SPL Working Capital Facility (\u201c2015 SPL Working Capital Facility\u201d), and $31.5 billion of total debt outstanding on a consolidated basis (before unamortized premium, discount and debt issuance costs), excluding $0.8 billion aggregate outstanding letters of credit and noting that borrowings under certain of our credit facilities may be restricted. We incur, and will incur, significant interest expense relating to the assets at the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi LNG terminals, and we anticipate needing to incur additional debt to finance the construction of Corpus Christi Stage 3. Our ability to fund our capital expenditures and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to access additional project financing as well as the debt and equity capital markets. A variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in\nkey benchmark interest rates and/or credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations and the repricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets. Our financing costs could increase or future borrowings or equity offerings may be unavailable to us or unsuccessful, which could cause us to be unable to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We also rely on borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our capital expenditures. If any of the lenders in the syndicates backing these facilities was unable to perform on its commitments, we may need to seek replacement financing, which may not be available as needed, or may be available in more limited amounts or on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms.\nWe have not always been profitable historically. We may not be able to achieve sustained profitability or generate positive operating cash flow in the future.\nWe had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as net losses attributable to common stockholders in prior years. In the future, we may incur operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow. We may not be able to reduce costs, increase revenues or reduce our debt service obligations sufficiently to maintain our cash resources, which could cause us to have inadequate liquidity to continue our business.\nWe will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures while we develop and construct the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and other projects. Any delays beyond the expected development period for these projects could cause operating losses and negative operating cash flows. Our future liquidity may also be affected by the timing of construction financing availability in relation to the incurrence of construction costs and other outflows and by the timing of receipt of cash flows under third-party agreements in relation to the incurrence of project and operating expenses. Moreover, many factors (including factors beyond our control) could result in a disparity between liquidity sources and cash needs, including factors such as construction delays and breaches of agreements. Our ability to generate any significant positive operating cash flow and achieve profitability in the future is dependent on our ability to successfully and timely complete and operate the applicable project.\nWe may sell equity or equity-related securities or assets, including equity interests in Cheniere Partners. Such sales could dilute our proportionate interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of Cheniere Partners or other subsidiaries, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have historically pursued a number of alternatives in order to finance the construction of our Trains, including potential issuances and sales of additional equity or equity-related securities by our subsidiaries. Such sales, in one or more transactions, could dilute our proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of Cheniere Partners, including the SPL Project, or in other subsidiaries or projects, including the CCL Project. In addition, such sales, or the anticipation of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our convertible notes.\nIn March 2015, we issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2045 (the \u201c2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) to certain investors through a registered direct offering. We have the option to satisfy the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes conversion obligation with cash, common stock or a combination thereof. Prior to December 15, 2044, the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence of certain conditions, and on and after such date they will become freely convertible. The 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes will become convertible into the common stock of Cheniere at an initial conversion price of $138.38 per share.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership percentages and voting power of our existing stockholders. Based on the initial conversion price, if we elect to satisfy the entire conversion obligation of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes with common stock, approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock would be issued upon the conversion, assuming the notes are converted at maturity. Any sales in the public market of the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes could adversely affect the prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon the performance by customers under long-term contracts that we have entered into, and we could be materially and adversely affected if any significant customer fails to perform its contractual obligations for any reason.\nOur future results and liquidity are substantially dependent upon performance by our customers to make payments under long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2020, SPL had SPAs with eight third-party customers, CCL had SPAs with nine third-party customers and our integrated marketing function had a limited number of SPAs with third-party customers. In addition, SPLNG had TUAs with two third-party customers. We are dependent on each customer\u2019s continued willingness and ability to perform its obligations under its SPA or TUA. We are exposed to the credit risk of any guarantor of these customers\u2019 obligations under their respective agreements in the event that we must seek recourse under a guaranty. As a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility in the energy markets, we believe we are exposed to heightened credit and performance risk of our customers. Additionally, some customers have indicated to us that COVID-19 has impacted their operations and/or may impact their operations in the future. Some of our SPA customers\u2019 primary countries of business have experienced a significant number of COVID-19 cases and/or have been subject to government imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. Although we believe that impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LNG regasification facilities, downstream markets and broader energy demand do not constitute valid force majeure claims under our FOB LNG SPAs, if any significant customer fails to perform its obligations under its SPA or TUA, our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, even if we were ultimately successful in seeking damages from that customer or its guarantor, if any, for a breach of the agreement.\nEach of our customer contracts is subject to termination under certain circumstances.\nEach of the SPAs contains various termination rights allowing our customers to terminate their SPAs, including, without limitation: (1) upon the occurrence of certain events of force majeure; (2) if we fail to make available specified scheduled cargo quantities; and (3) delays in the commencement of commercial operations. We may not be able to replace these SPAs on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated.\nEach of SPLNG\u2019s long-term TUAs contains various termination rights. For example, each customer may terminate its TUA if the Sabine Pass LNG terminal experiences a force majeure delay for longer than 18 months, fails to redeliver a specified amount of natural gas in accordance with the customer\u2019s redelivery nominations or fails to accept and unload a specified number of the customer\u2019s proposed LNG cargoes. SPLNG may not be able to replace these TUAs on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated.\nOur subsidiaries may be restricted under the terms of their indebtedness from making distributions under certain circumstances, which may limit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to pay or increase distributions to us or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project and could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe agreements governing our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness restrict payments that our subsidiaries can make to Cheniere Partners or us in certain events and limit the indebtedness that our subsidiaries can incur. For example, SPL is restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.\nCCH is generally restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness until, among other requirements, the completion of the construction of Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project, funding of a debt service reserve account equal to six months of debt service and achieving a historical debt service coverage ratio and fixed projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 inability to pay distributions to Cheniere Partners or us or to incur additional indebtedness as a result of the foregoing restrictions in the agreements governing their indebtedness may inhibit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to pay or increase distributions to us and its other unitholders or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRestrictions in agreements governing us and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness may prevent us and our subsidiaries from engaging in certain beneficial transactions.\nIn addition to restrictions on the ability of us, Cheniere Partners, SPL and CCH to make distributions or incur additional indebtedness, the agreements governing our indebtedness also contain various other covenants that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022purchase, redeem or retire equity interests;\n\u2022issue preferred stock;\n\u2022sell or transfer assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nOur use of hedging arrangements may adversely affect our future operating results or liquidity.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in (1) changing interest rates, (2) commodity-related marketing and price risks and (3) foreign exchange volatility, we enter into derivative financial instruments, including futures, swaps and option contracts. To the extent we hedge our exposure to commodity price, interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate exposures, we forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates were to change favorably to our hedged position. Hedging arrangements could also expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022expected supply is less than the amount hedged or is otherwise imperfect;\n\u2022the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices or hedged item recognized in earnings, unless they satisfy criteria for, and we elect, the normal purchases and sales exception or hedge accounting treatment. All of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for these exceptions from fair value reporting through earnings. As a result, our quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in fair value, including circumstances in which there is no underlying economic impact yet realized.\nThe use of derivatives also may require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties, which can impact working capital when commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates change.\nThe regulatory and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder and other regulations, including EMIR and REMIT, could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and our operating results and cash flows.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted by the CFTC, the SEC and other federal regulators establishing federal regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities like us that participate in that market may adversely affect our ability to manage certain of our risks on a cost effective basis. Such laws and regulations may also adversely affect our ability to execute our strategies with respect to hedging our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to the future sale of our LNG inventory and to price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate our LNG terminals and to secure natural gas feedstock for our liquefaction facilities.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and federal banking regulators have adopted rules to require certain market participants to collect and post initial and/or variation margin with respect to uncleared swaps from their counterparties\nthat are financial end users and certain registered swap dealers and major swap participants. Although we believe we will not be required to post margin with respect to any uncleared swaps we enter into in the future, were we required to post margin as to our uncleared swaps in the future, our cost of entering into and maintaining swaps would be increased. Our counterparties that are subject to the regulations imposing the Basel III capital requirements on them may increase the cost to us of entering into swaps with them or, although not required to collect margin from us under the margin rules, contractually require us to post collateral with them in connection with such swaps in order to offset their increased capital costs or to reduce their capital costs to maintain those swaps on their balance sheets.\nEuropean and UK-specific regulations, including but not limited to EMIR, MiFID II, REMIT, MAR, FSMA and RAO, govern our trading activities and our compliance with such laws may result in increased costs and risks to the business similar to the impacts stated above with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act. The increased costs may also have an adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Further, any violation of the foregoing laws and regulations could result in investigations, and possible fines and penalties, and in some scenarios, criminal offenses.\nFurther, although a trade deal (the \"Deal\") has been reached between the UK and EU following Brexit, with the terms of this deal applying as on January 1, 2021, uncertainties remain. While the UK has implemented its own versions of many key EU rules mentioned above (known as 'onshoring'), the Deal was largely focused on goods, not services. Financial services will be negotiated separately, with an initial deadline for agreement set for March 2021. Depending on the terms of this agreement, and the extent to which the UK chooses to diverge from existing EU rules, mutual equivalence decisions could be granted by each side with the effect that compliance with either financial services regime is equivalent to compliance with the corresponding regime in the eyes of each jurisdictions' regulators. Until these issues are clarified, both sides have implemented temporary measures to avoid major disruption in areas like derivatives trading and clearing.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Terminal Operations and Commercialization\nCost overruns and delays in the completion of one or more Trains, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing to pay for such costs and delays, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe actual construction costs of the Trains may be significantly higher than our current estimates as a result of many factors, including change orders under existing or future EPC contracts resulting from the occurrence of certain specified events that may give our EPC contractor the right to cause us to enter into change orders or resulting from changes with which we otherwise agree. We have already experienced increased costs due to change orders. As construction progresses, we may decide or be forced to submit change orders to our contractor that could result in longer construction periods, higher construction costs or both, including change orders to comply with existing or future environmental or other regulations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting actions taken by governmental and regulatory authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may cause a slow-down in the construction of one or more Trains. Our EPC contractor has advised us of voluntary proactive measures it is taking to protect employees and to mitigate risks associated with COVID-19, however, it has not indicated that there will be any changes to the project cost or schedule and is still performing its obligations under its EPC contracts. While the construction of Trains is continuing, if there were a major outbreak of COVID-19 at any construction site or the implementation of restrictions by the government that prevented construction for an extended period, we could experience significant delays in the construction of one or more Trains.\nDelays in the construction of one or more Trains beyond the estimated development periods, as well as change orders to our existing EPC contracts or any future EPC contract related to additional Trains, could increase the cost of completion beyond the amounts that we estimate, which could require us to obtain additional sources of financing to fund our operations until the applicable liquefaction project is fully constructed (which could cause further delays). Our ability to obtain financing that may be needed to provide additional funding to cover increased costs will depend, in part, on factors beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain financing, we may have to accept terms that are disadvantageous to us or that may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur ability to complete development of additional Trains will be contingent on our ability to obtain additional funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be unable to fully execute our business strategy.\nWe will require significant additional funding to be able to commence construction of additional Trains, which we may not be able to obtain at a cost that results in positive economics, or at all. The inability to achieve acceptable funding may cause a delay in the development of additional Trains, and we may not be able to complete our business plan. Even if we are able to obtain funding, the funding may be inadequate to cover any increases in costs or delays in completion of additional Trains, which may cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected therefrom or cause a loss of one or more future customers in the event of significant delays. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nHurricanes or other disasters could result in an interruption of our operations, a delay in the completion of our Liquefaction Projects, damage to our Liquefaction Projects and increased insurance costs, all of which could adversely affect us.\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricanes Laura and Delta in 2020 caused temporary suspension in construction or operation of our Liquefaction Projects or caused minor damage to our Liquefaction Projects. In August 2020, SPL and CCL entered into an arrangement to provide the ability, in limited circumstances, to potentially fulfill commitments to LNG buyers from the other facility in the event operational conditions impact operations at either the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi terminal. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 17 TBtu was loaded at affiliate facilities pursuant to this agreement. Future storms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or interruption of operations at, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, the Corpus Christi terminal or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 or our other facilities and increase our insurance premiums. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has reported that the U.S.\u2019s energy and transportation systems are expected to be increasingly disrupted by climate change and extreme weather events. An increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as storms, floods, fires and rising sea levels could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies with respect to the design, construction and operation of our facilities, the development and operation of our pipelines and the export of LNG could impede operations and construction and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe design, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, including the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and other facilities, and the import and export of LNG and the purchase and transportation of natural gas, are highly regulated activities. Approvals of the FERC and DOE under Section 3 and Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, including several under the CAA and the CWA, are required in order to construct and operate an LNG facility and an interstate natural gas pipeline and export LNG. Although the FERC has issued orders under Section 3 of the NGA authorizing the siting, construction and operation of the six Trains and related facilities of the SPL Project, the three Trains and related facilities of the CCL Project and the seven midscale Trains and related facilities for Corpus Christi Stage 3, as well as orders under Section 7 of the NGA authorizing the construction and operation of the Creole Trail Pipeline, the Corpus Christi Pipeline and the pipeline for Corpus Christi Stage 3, the FERC orders require us to comply with certain ongoing conditions and obtain certain additional approvals in conjunction with ongoing construction and operations of our liquefaction and pipeline facilities. We will be required to obtain similar approvals and permits with respect to any expansion or modification of our liquefaction and pipeline facilities. We cannot control the outcome of the regulatory review and approval processes. Certain of these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations are or may be subject to rehearing requests, appeals and other challenges.\nAuthorizations obtained from the FERC, DOE and other federal and state regulatory agencies also contain ongoing conditions, and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed. We do not know whether or when any such approvals or permits can be obtained, or whether any existing or potential interventions or other actions by third parties will interfere with our ability to obtain and maintain such permits or approvals. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the necessary approvals and permits, including as a result of untimely notices or filings, we may not be able to recover our investment in our projects. Additionally, government disruptions, such as a U.S. government shutdown, may delay or halt our ability to obtain and maintain necessary approvals and permits. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis, and failure to\nobtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nDelays in the completion of one or more Trains could lead to reduced revenues or termination of one or more of the SPAs by our customers.\nAny delay in completion of a Train could cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected therefrom or cause a loss of one or more customers in the event of significant delays. In particular, each of our SPAs provides that the customer may terminate that SPA if the relevant Train does not timely commence commercial operations. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are dependent on Bechtel and other contractors for the successful completion of the Liquefaction Projects.\nTimely and cost-effective completion of the Liquefaction Projects in compliance with agreed specifications is central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of Bechtel and our other contractors under their agreements. The ability of Bechtel and our other contractors to perform successfully under their agreements is dependent on a number of factors, including their ability to:\n\u2022design and engineer each Train to operate in accordance with specifications;\n\u2022engage and retain third-party subcontractors and procure equipment and supplies;\n\u2022respond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control;\n\u2022attract, develop and retain skilled personnel, including engineers;\n\u2022post required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof;\n\u2022manage the construction process generally, including coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022maintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital.\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages if the contractor fails to perform in the manner required with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may delay or impair the operation of the Liquefaction Projects, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to cover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. The obligations of Bechtel and our other contractors to pay liquidated damages under their agreements are subject to caps on liability, as set forth therein.\nFurthermore, we may have disagreements with our contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under their contracts and increase the cost of the Liquefaction Projects or result in a contractor\u2019s unwillingness to perform further work on the Liquefaction Projects. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the negotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement, we would be required to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities are or become unavailable to transport natural gas, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide gas delivery options to our liquefaction facilities and pipelines. If the construction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to meet our SPA obligations and continue shipping natural gas from producing regions or to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under the SPAs, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder the SPAs with our customers, we are required to make available to them a specified amount of LNG at specified times. However, we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas to satisfy those obligations, which may provide affected SPA customers with the right to terminate their SPAs. Our failure to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines and their FERC gas tariffs are subject to FERC regulation.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the \u201cNGPA\u201d). The FERC regulates the purchase and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the construction and operation of pipelines, the rates, terms and conditions of service and abandonment of facilities. Under the NGA, the rates charged by our interstate natural gas pipelines must be just and reasonable, and we are prohibited from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. If we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, our interstate pipelines could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nIn addition, as a natural gas market participant, should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EPAct, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and the NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.3 million per day for each violation.\nPipeline safety integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nThe PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in \u201chigh consequence areas\u201d where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As an operator, we are required to:\n\u2022perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a \u201chigh consequence area\u201d;\n\u2022improve data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022implement preventative and mitigating actions.\nWe are required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should we fail to comply with applicable statutes and the Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, we could be subject to significant penalties and fines.\nAny reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes transported in our pipelines, which would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nWe are dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from our pipelines. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect which causes a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we lose the right to situate our pipelines on property owned by third parties.\nWe do not own the land on which our pipelines are situated, and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use rights. If we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are relying on estimates for the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Liquefaction Projects, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe are relying on third parties, principally Bechtel, for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Liquefaction Projects. If any Train, when actually constructed, fails to have the capacity ratings and performance capabilities that we intend, our estimates may not be accurate. Failure of any of our Trains to achieve our intended capacity ratings and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our SPAs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nAny failure to perform by our counterparties under agreements may adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nOur integrated marketing function involves our entering into various purchase and sale, hedging and other transactions with numerous third parties (commonly referred to as \u201ccounterparties\u201d). In such arrangements, we are exposed to the performance and credit risks of our counterparties, including the risk that one or more counterparties fails to perform its obligation to make deliveries of commodities and/or to make payments. These risks may increase during periods of commodity price volatility. Defaults by suppliers and other counterparties may adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nWe may not be able to contract with customers to sell LNG produced in excess of the aggregate annual contract quantities committed to SPL\u2019s and CCL\u2019s third-party SPAs.\nWe expect to sell any LNG produced in excess of the aggregate annual contract quantity committed to SPL\u2019s and CCL\u2019s third-party SPAs through our integrated marketing function. We have, and continue to develop, a portfolio of long-, medium- and short-term SPAs to transport and unload commercial LNG cargoes to locations worldwide, which is primarily sourced by LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects in excess of the contract quantities committed to SPL\u2019s and CCL\u2019s third party SPAs, supplemented by volume procured from other locations worldwide, as needed. Excess LNG from the Liquefaction Projects competes with other sources of LNG that are priced to indices other than Henry Hub, and any collapse in the spread between global LNG prices and the Henry Hub index could impact the ability of our integrated marketing function to profitably sell any such excess LNG. Failure to secure buyers for a sufficient amount of LNG could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Business in General\nWe may not construct or operate all of our proposed LNG facilities or Trains or any additional LNG facilities or Trains beyond those currently planned, which could limit our growth prospects.\nWe may not construct some of our proposed LNG facilities or Trains, whether due to lack of commercial interest or inability to obtain financing or otherwise. Our ability to develop additional liquefaction facilities will also depend on the availability and pricing of LNG and natural gas in North America and other places around the world. Competitors may have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources and access to sources of natural gas and LNG than we do. If we are unable or unwilling to construct and operate additional LNG facilities, our prospects for growth will be limited.\nOur cost estimates for Trains are subject to change as a result of cost overruns, change orders under existing or future construction contracts, changes in commodity prices (particularly nickel and steel), escalating labor costs and the potential need for additional funds to be expended to maintain construction schedules. In the event we experience cost overruns, delays or\nboth, the amount of funding needed to complete a Train could exceed our available funds and result in our failure to complete such Train and thereby negatively impact our business and limit our growth prospects.\nCyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas may adversely affect our LNG business and the performance of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nOur LNG business and the development of domestic LNG facilities and projects generally is based on assumptions about the future availability and price of natural gas and LNG, and the prospects for international natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022additions to competitive regasification capacity in North America, Europe, Asia and other markets, which could divert LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal;\n\u2022competitive liquefaction capacity in North America;\n\u2022insufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide;\n\u2022insufficient LNG tanker capacity;\n\u2022weather conditions, including extreme weather events and temperature volatility resulting from climate change;\n\u2022reduced demand and lower prices for natural gas;\n\u2022increased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;\n\u2022decreased oil and natural gas exploration activities which may decrease the production of natural gas, including as a result of any potential ban on production of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022cost improvements that allow competitors to offer LNG regasification services or provide natural gas liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices;\n\u2022changes in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022changes in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;\n\u2022political conditions in natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022sudden decreases in demand for LNG as a result of natural disasters or public health crises, including the occurrence of a pandemic, and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022adverse relative demand for LNG compared to other markets, which may decrease LNG imports into or exports from North America; and\n\u2022cyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.\nAdverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the price of LNG and/or natural gas, which could materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of imported or exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for the United States or international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOperations of the Liquefaction Projects are dependent upon the ability of our SPA customers to deliver LNG supplies from the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be supplied from North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas may be discovered\noutside the United States, which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the United States and could result in natural gas in those markets being available at a lower cost than LNG exported to those markets.\nAlthough SPL has entered into arrangements to utilize up to approximately three-quarters of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in connection with operations of the SPL Project, operations at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal are dependent, in part, upon the ability of our TUA customers to import LNG supplies into the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy in North America. In North America, due mainly to a historically abundant supply of natural gas and discoveries of substantial quantities of unconventional, or shale, natural gas, imported LNG has not developed into a significant energy source. The success of the regasification services component of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be produced internationally and delivered to North America at a lower cost than the cost to produce some domestic supplies of natural gas, or other alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas have recently been and may continue to be discovered in North America, which could further increase the available supply of natural gas and could result in natural gas being available at a lower cost than imported LNG.\nPolitical instability in foreign countries that import or export natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the United States, may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG purchasers or suppliers and merchants in such countries to import or export LNG from or to the United States. Furthermore, some foreign purchasers or suppliers of LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their LNG from, or direct their LNG to, non-U.S. markets or from or to our competitors\u2019 liquefaction or regasification facilities in the United States.\nIn addition to natural gas, LNG also competes with other sources of energy, including coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy. LNG from the Liquefaction Projects also competes with other sources of LNG, including LNG that is priced to indices other than Henry Hub. Some of these sources of energy may be available at a lower cost than LNG from the Liquefaction Projects in certain markets. The cost of LNG supplies from the United States, including the Liquefaction Projects, may also be impacted by an increase in natural gas prices in the United States.\nAs a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy in the United States or internationally. The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the United States or to the United States on a commercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG to or from the United States generally, or to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal or from the Liquefaction Projects specifically, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nVarious economic and political factors could negatively affect the development, construction and operation of LNG facilities, including the Liquefaction Projects and expansion projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCommercial development of an LNG facility takes a number of years, requires a substantial capital investment and may be delayed by factors such as:\n\u2022increased construction costs;\n\u2022economic downturns, increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022decreases in the price of LNG, which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in LNG projects;\n\u2022the inability of project owners or operators to obtain governmental approvals to construct or operate LNG facilities;\n\u2022political unrest or local community resistance to the siting of LNG facilities due to safety, environmental or security concerns; and\n\u2022any significant explosion, spill or similar incident involving an LNG facility or LNG vessel.\nThere may be impediments to the transport of LNG, such as shortages of LNG vessels worldwide or operational impacts on LNG shipping, including maritime transportation routes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe construction and delivery of LNG vessels require significant capital and long construction lead times. Additionally, the availability of LNG vessels and transportation costs could be impacted to the detriment of our business and our customers because of:\n\u2022an inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials;\n\u2022political or economic disturbances;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;\n\u2022work stoppages or other labor disturbances;\n\u2022bankruptcy or other financial crisis of shipbuilders or shipowners;\n\u2022quality or engineering problems;\n\u2022disruptions to maritime transportation routes; and\n\u2022weather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake, tsunami or fire.\nWe may not be able to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity on economic terms that is sufficient to meet our feed gas transportation requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have contracted for firm capacity for our natural gas feedstock transportation requirements for the Liquefaction Projects and for Corpus Christi Stage 3. If and when we need to replace one or more of our existing agreements with these interconnecting pipelines, we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under certain of our SPAs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe face competition based upon the international market price for LNG.\nOur Liquefaction Projects are subject to the risk of LNG price competition at times when we need to replace any existing SPA, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new SPAs. Factors relating to competition may prevent us from entering into a new or replacement SPA on economically comparable terms as existing SPAs, or at all. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our Liquefaction Projects are diverse and include, among others:\n\u2022increases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n\u2022increases in demand for LNG but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n\u2022increases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our Liquefaction Projects;\n\u2022decreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate fuels such as coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel;\n\u2022decreases in the price of non-U.S. LNG, including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;\n\u2022increases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities; and\n\u2022displacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available.\nTerrorist attacks, cyber incidents or military campaigns may adversely impact our business.\nA terrorist attack, cyber incident or military incident involving an LNG facility, our infrastructure or an LNG vessel may result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction of new LNG facilities, including one or more of the Trains, which would increase our costs and decrease our cash flows. A terrorist incident or cyber incident may also result in temporary or permanent closure of our existing facilities, which could increase our costs and decrease our cash flows, depending on the duration and timing of the closure. Our operations could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost to us. In addition, the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect our business and our customers, including their ability to satisfy their obligations to us under our commercial agreements. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, cyber incidents or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. The continuation of these developments may subject our construction and our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and volatility in the energy markets may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in significant disruption globally. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have restricted travel, business operations, and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. Additionally, recent disputes over production levels between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing countries have resulted in increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices.\nThe extent, duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects will depend on future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity, as well as actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic or any future resurgence. These developments include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates, the demand for oil and natural gas, levels of consumer confidence and the post-pandemic pace of recovery.\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation. The COVID-19 pandemic alone or coupled with continued volatility in the energy markets may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects or have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. The extent to which our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects are affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic or volatility in the energy markets will depend on various factors beyond our control and are highly uncertain, including the duration and scope of the outbreak, decreased demand for LNG and the resulting economic effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nOutbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, at one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nFederal, state and local governments have enacted various measures to try to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Our facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Corpus Christi LNG terminal are critical infrastructure and have continued to operate during the outbreak, which means that we must keep our employees who operate our facilities safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus. In response, we have taken extra precautionary measures to protect the continued safety and welfare of our employees who continue to work at our facilities and have modified certain business and workforce practices, such as implementing work from home policies where appropriate, but there can be no assurances that these measures will prevent any outbreak. Furthermore, the measures taken to prevent an outbreak at our facilities have resulted in increased costs and it is unclear how long such increased costs will continue to be incurred. If a large number of our employees in those critical facilities were to contract COVID-19 at the same time, our operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to significant construction and operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses for us.\nThe construction and operation of our LNG terminals and our pipelines are, and will be, subject to the inherent risks associated with these types of operations, including explosions, breakdowns or failures of equipment, operational errors by vessel or tug operators, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and adverse weather conditions and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons and property. In addition, our operations and the facilities and vessels of third parties on which our operations are dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism.\nWe do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nExisting and future environmental and similar laws and governmental regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs or construction costs and restrictions.\nOur business is and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to our construction and operation activities relating to, among other things, air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA, the Oil Pollution Act, the CWA and the RCRA, and analogous state laws and regulations, restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities, and require us to maintain permits and provide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and reports related to our compliance. In addition, certain laws and regulations authorize regulators having jurisdiction over the construction and operation of our LNG terminals and pipelines, including FERC and PHMSA, to issue compliance orders, which may restrict or limit operations or increase compliance or operating costs. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, compliance orders, fines and penalties or to capital expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of our facilities, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment at or from our facilities and for resulting damage to natural resources.\nIn 2009, the EPA promulgated and finalized the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions from stationary sources in a variety of industries. In 2010, the EPA expanded the rule to include reporting obligations for LNG terminals. In addition, the EPA has defined GHG emissions thresholds that would subject GHG emissions from new and modified industrial sources to regulation if the source is subject to PSD Permit requirements due to its emissions of non-GHG criteria pollutants. While the EPA subsequently took a number of additional actions primarily relating to GHG emissions from the electric power generation and the oil and gas exploration and production industries, those rules were largely stayed or repealed during the Trump Administration including by amendments adopted by the EPA on February 23, 2018 and additional amendments to new source performance standards for the oil and gas industry on September 14 and 15, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to consider publishing for notice and comment a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the September 2020 rule, which could result in more stringent GHG emissions rulemaking. In addition, other federal and state initiatives may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through, for example, United States treaty commitments, direct regulation, market-based regulations such as a carbon emissions tax or cap-and-trade programs or clean energy standards. Such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas, which we consume at our terminals, or could increase compliance costs for our operations. We are supportive of regulations reducing GHG emissions over time.\nOther future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG imported to or exported from our terminals or climate policies of destination countries in relation to their obligations under the Paris Agreement or other national climate change-related policies, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in our business and to our proposed construction activities, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that\nresult in increased compliance costs or additional operating or construction costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damages.\nHealth and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in personal harm or injury, penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities. Such a failure could generate public concern and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us. In addition, changes in our senior management or other key personnel could affect our business results.\nWe are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and pipelines and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. Our affiliates who hire personnel on our behalf are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures, changes in applicable laws and regulations or labor disputes could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend on our executive officers for various activities. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our personnel. Although we have arrangements relating to compensation and benefits with certain of our executive officers, we do not have any employment contracts or other agreements with key personnel other than our employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer binding them to provide services for any particular term. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur lack of diversification could have an adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nSubstantially all of our anticipated revenue in 2021 will be dependent upon our two facilities, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in southern Louisiana and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas. Due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification, an adverse development at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, including the related pipelines, or in the LNG industry, would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and operating results than if we maintained more diverse assets and operating areas.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe test our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including a significant decline in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows for our business or disruptions to our business could lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets, including goodwill. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. Projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results. In addition, if our analysis results in an impairment to our goodwill or long-lived assets, we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our Consolidated Financial Statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn June 2019, our Board authorized a three-year, $1 billion share repurchase program and as of December 31, 2020, up to $596 million remains available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. For example, during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, the market price of our common stock ranged between $27.06 and $71.03. Such fluctuations may continue as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for natural gas and corresponding fluctuations in the price of natural gas;\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022issuance of additional equity securities which causes further dilution to stockholders;\n\u2022sales of a high volume of shares of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;\n\u2022changes in government regulation or proposals applicable to us;\n\u2022actual or potential non-performance by any customer or a counterparty under any agreement;\n\u2022announcements made by us or our competitors of significant contracts;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general conditions in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial or other estimates by analysts;\n\u2022changes in investor sentiment regarding the energy industry and fossil fuels; and\n\u2022other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the United States securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. If we were to be the object of securities class litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons, it could result in substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our financial results.", "PERMNO": 84723, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "LNG"}
