Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations and make an investment in its securities risky. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies Kodak\u2019s assessment of the most significant factors which may adversely affect its business, operations, financial position, stock price or future financial performance. Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.\nRisks Related to Kodak\u2019s Business\nIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.\nKodak\u2019s business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, Kodak may be unsuccessful in executing its business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. In addition, Kodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. If restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships.\nFinally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s business.\nThe ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business.\nThe positive cash flow from operations generated by Kodak in 2019 were derived from working capital improvements and individual transactions which occurred during the year and are not expected to be recurring. Kodak has not generated positive operating cash flows without supplementing such cash flow from operations with monetization transactions over the past several years and, based on forecasted cash flows, there are uncertainties regarding its ability to meet commitments in the U.S. as they come due. The Print segment is its largest segment and has had declining revenues and segment earnings which are expected to continue to decline. Kodak\u2019s stable and remaining growth businesses may not grow or continue to generate the same or enough cash flow to offset businesses with declining cash flows and investments needed for certain growth businesses. It may take Kodak longer to generate positive cash flow from operations than planned, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position. If Kodak is unable to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future or to adequately supplement such cash flow from operations with proceeds from monetization transactions, its ability to continue as a going concern could be impaired or limited.\nContinued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments, dividends and servicing the Company\u2019s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.\nKodak\u2019s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal or mandatory redemption price of, or interest and dividends on, the 5% Secured Convertible Notes (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) and the 5.50% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), or to fund Kodak\u2019s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, restructuring actions, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances and other general corporate requirements. Its film manufacturing facilities are aged and without significant updates to equipment and systems will be more prone to failure. Capital improvements are planned but there is risk to manufacturing operations especially due to the complexity of the processes and technology and the loss of knowledge as employees leave who are familiar with the processes and technology. The longer these updates are delayed the higher the risk due to equipment failures, further obsolescence and additional loss of employees with the specific knowledge base.\nKodak\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. There are no assurances:\n\u2022\nKodak\u2019s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;\n\u2022\nKodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;\n\u2022\nthe Company will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nKodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan;\n\u2022\nKodak will not have to expend cash defending lawsuits regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or\n\u2022\nFuture sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.\nIf Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company\u2019s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company\u2019s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in its ability to provide products and services, reduce its ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be taken on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak\u2019s liquidity needs.\nIf Kodak is unable to successfully develop, fund and commercialize products in certain businesses upon which it is focused or do so within an acceptable timeframe, its financial performance could be adversely affected.\nKodak has focused its investments in Print, Advanced Materials, and Chemicals. These investment areas include offset plates and CTP devices, digital printing using commercial inkjet and electrophotography, high resolution functional printing for electronic and optical solutions, specialty chemicals, and smart materials for light control and 3D printing. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for Kodak to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or that its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If Kodak is unsuccessful in growing its investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.\nDue to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak\u2019s worldwide distribution, Kodak is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which, together with tariffs that may be imposed, may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position.\nAs a result of Kodak\u2019s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales and profitability can be negatively impacted across all its segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan. In addition, Kodak\u2019s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum-based or other commodity-based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. In the case of aluminum and other raw materials and components imported by Kodak, tariffs imposed from time to time may give rise to future cost increases. Tariffs or duties may also be imposed on exported products produced by Kodak, making such products less competitive in jurisdictions imposing such tariffs or duties. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.\nWeakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s financial performance and liquidity.\nThe global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak\u2019s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility, including as a result of the global outbreak of the coronavirus formally known as COVID-19. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity. In particular, if the coronavirus has a significant impact on the printing industry it could adversely impact the demand for Kodak\u2019s products. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers\u2019 ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, including as a result of the coronavirus, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak\u2019s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) held a referendum in which voters opted for the country\u2019s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, Consistent with the outcome of this referendum, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. Thus, the UK is no longer a member of the EU; however, the UK will continue to be subject to EU rules and remain a member of the single market and customs union during an implementation period. The implementation period runs to December 31, 2020 but may be extended for up to two years. The UK government is negotiating with the EU on trade and other terms for such exit. Leaving without any agreement on such terms would lead to disruption to UK/EU trade. However, Kodak has put appropriate plans in place for continuity of supply and purchase of products, although there is likely to be some limited cost impact associated with these plans.\nThe uncertainty concerning Brexit has also caused global stock market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. There may also be broader uncertainty over the position the United States will take with respect to certain treaty and trade relationships with other countries. This uncertainty may impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact business in the United States, including with the Company, (ii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies, (iii) global stock markets and (iv) general global economic conditions. All of these factors are outside Kodak\u2019s control but may cause it to adjust its strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets and could adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIf Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products or do so in a timely manner, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer.\nKodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards.\nWithout the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify customer needs;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications;\n\u2022\ncommercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate its offerings from its competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nprice its products and services competitively;\n\u2022\nanticipate its competitors\u2019 development of new products, services or technological innovations;\n\u2022\nwork successfully alongside its partners; and\n\u2022\ncontrol product quality in its manufacturing processes.\nAs a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak (for example, UltraStream technology, new generations of Sonora offset plates, and small particle technology) may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.\nIf Kodak\u2019s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent issues with product reliability, yield and quality, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed.\nIn developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak\u2019s products and services it must adequately address reliability and prevent yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak\u2019s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation; and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, all of which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.\nIf the reputation of Kodak or its brand erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on its financial results.\nKodak\u2019s reputation, and the reputation of its brand, form the foundation of its relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including customers, suppliers and consumers. The quality and safety of Kodak\u2019s products are critical to its business. Kodak\u2019s products have worldwide recognition, and its financial success is directly dependent on the success of its product offering. One aspect of Kodak\u2019s business is licensing others to use Kodak\u2019s brand in connection with the sale of such licensees\u2019 products and services, and activities by such licensees may be perceived by the market as being activities of Kodak. The success of Kodak\u2019s brand can suffer if its or its licensees\u2019 marketing plans, product initiatives or activities do not have the desired impact on the brand\u2019s image or ability to attract customers. Kodak\u2019s results could also be negatively impacted if its brand suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to significant product reliability and quality issues, and product-related litigation. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about Kodak, its licensees or its brand could generate adverse publicity which could damage the reputation of the brand. Kodak also devotes significant time and resources to programs consistent with its corporate values and commitments that are designed to protect and preserve its reputation, such as social responsibility and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, Kodak\u2019s reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on Kodak\u2019s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.\nThe markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may:\n\u2022\nforesee the course of market developments more accurately than it does;\n\u2022\nsell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services;\n\u2022\nhave the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost;\n\u2022\nhave better access to materials and supplies and the ability to acquire materials and supplies at a lower cost;\n\u2022\ndevelop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers;\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or\n\u2022\nhave access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.\nAs a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.\nAn inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak\u2019s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position.\nThe competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak\u2019s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.\nThe loss of one or more of Kodak\u2019s key personnel, or its failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm its business.\nIn order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak\u2019s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.\nIf Kodak cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer needs and preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nKodak serves imaging/print needs for business markets, including graphic communications, packaging, enterprise services, and printed electronics. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak\u2019s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of Kodak\u2019s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak\u2019s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.\nKodak has reduced the scope of its corporate-focused research and development activities. If its investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services.\nKodak makes investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns.\nCommercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive Kodak\u2019s latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. Kodak may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all.\nNew products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins Kodak has experienced historically. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s revenue.\nKodak relies on third-party suppliers and service providers to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on external business partners.\nKodak relies on third-party suppliers for goods and services to support its manufacturing, logistics, and business operations. To the extent it relies on third-parties, it faces the risks that those third parties may not be able to:\n\u2022\ndevelop manufacturing methods appropriate to Kodak\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nmaintain an adequate control environment;\n\u2022\nquickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nobtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or\n\u2022\nmitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or other disruptions.\nSuppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services. In addition, Kodak may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, medical epidemics, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier\u2019s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers. Other supplier problems that Kodak could encounter include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak\u2019s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant negative change in the payment terms that Kodak has with its suppliers could adversely affect its liquidity. There is a risk that Kodak\u2019s key suppliers could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with its financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of goods or services to Kodak on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery, or shorter payment terms. Kodak\u2019s need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and its supply could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of its key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on its sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm Kodak\u2019s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.\nWorldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism and other physical security threats, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.\nThe ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus formally known as COVID-19 emanating from China in December 2019 and spreading throughout many regions of the world has resulted in travel restrictions to and from affected regions, disruptions to suppliers\u2019 performance and delivery, in some cases whether or not based in affected regions, as well as the temporary shutdown of many businesses in affected regions. Kodak has manufacturing, service and sales operations in affected regions, including China, Germany and Italy, and regularly imports and exports products into and out of the affected regions. Kodak also relies on:\n\u2022\ncertain third-party suppliers and vendors in affected regions for goods and services to support its global business operations;\n\u2022\ncustomers whose need for Kodak products is based on manufacturing operations in affected regions;\n\u2022\nsuppliers, some of which are based in affected regions, to transport products into and out of affected regions;\n\u2022\ncompanies operating outside affected regions who obtain critical raw materials or components from affected regions to supply Kodak;\n\u2022\nthe shooting, production and release of motion picture films in or dependent on affected regions; and\n\u2022\nroyalties from brand licensees that source products from or sell products in affected regions.\nCertain of Kodak\u2019s critical business functions, including its manufacturing and field service operations, cannot be performed remotely, and an inability of Kodak\u2019s employees to physically work at its or its customers locations due to government restrictions, health concerns or illness may disrupt its operations, perhaps significantly. Kodak has already experienced some disruptions in its manufacturing and logistics operations due to the coronavirus outbreak. The full extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts Kodak\u2019s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of this filing, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Complications from the coronavirus outbreak could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business operations and our results of operations and financial position, particularly if such complications have an extended duration.\nIn addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to its operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. Kodak has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact Kodak\u2019s ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time.\nKodak\u2019s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results.\nAs part of Kodak\u2019s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives. In order to successfully pursue its strategic transaction strategy, it must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. There are no assurances Kodak will be able to consummate any strategic transactions which it undertakes or, if consummated, Kodak will achieve the benefits sought to be achieved from such strategic transactions. If Kodak fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further its strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.\nKodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay.\nKodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its business;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control;\n\u2022\nwrong, inaccurate or changing business assumptions on which such acquisitions or combinations are predicated;\n\u2022\npotential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas;\n\u2022\nan increase in its expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be temporarily diverted; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.\nCyber-attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Kodak\u2019s operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary of confidential information about its workforce, its customers, or other third parties could disrupt its business, harm its reputation, cause it to lose customers, and expose it to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation.\nTo effectively manage Kodak\u2019s global business, it depends on secure and reliable information technology systems with accurate data. These systems and their underlying infrastructure are provided by a combination of Kodak and third-parties, and if unavailable or unreliable, could disrupt Kodak\u2019s operations, causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacturing or delivery of products, delaying the reporting of financial results, or impacting other business processes critical to running its business.\nKodak\u2019s IT systems contain critical information about its business, including intellectual property and confidential information of its customers, business partners, and employees. Cyber-attacks or defects in its systems could result in this proprietary information being disclosed or modified, which could cause significant damage to its business or its reputation. Kodak has system controls and security measures in place that are designed to protect its IT systems against intentional or unintentional disruptions of its operations or disclosure of confidential information, but it may not be able to implement solutions that result in stopping or detecting all of these threats to its internal information systems or those of its third-party providers. A breach of Kodak\u2019s security measures could result in unauthorized access to and misuse of its information, corruption of data, or disruption of operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its business.\nKodak also provides IT-based products and services to its customers, and operates services used by its customers and hosted by Kodak, both businesses and consumers, and a breach of its security or reliability measures, or those of its third-party service providers, could negatively impact its customers\u2019 operations or data privacy.\nAttacks on IT systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and Kodak is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses.\nIt has programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, Kodak may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.\nRegulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could adversely impact Kodak\u2019s business. Kodak has a global operating presence, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Kodak is also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others. In addition, Kodak is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\nKodak has implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and it periodically reviews, upgrades and enhances certain of its policies and procedures. However, there can be no assurance that its employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of its policies for which it may be ultimately responsible, or that its policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators. Any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of Kodak\u2019s business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage its reputation and have a materially adverse effect on its results of operation or financial condition.\nFailure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nKodak receives, processes, transmits and stores information relating to identifiable individuals (personal information), both in its role as a technology provider and as an employer. As a result, Kodak is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal information. These laws have been subject to frequent changes, and new legislation in this area may be enacted at any time. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective on May 25, 2018 for all European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of EU residents that are partially different from those previously in place and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective on January 1, 2020 and many other states are in various stages of implementing privacy legislation. The CCPA provides California residents with specific privacy rights including a new private right of action for certain data breaches.\nRecently enacted laws and regulations, as well as any other change to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area, or the failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable, may subject Kodak to, among other things, additional costs or changes to its business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on its ability to obtain and process information and allegations by its customers and clients that it has not performed its contractual obligations. At the same time, the risk of cyber-attacks is relevant to the requirements regarding storage, transfer, sharing and handling of personal information.\nThis environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls and contractual arrangements across its businesses and geographies. Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nIf Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.\nA key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors\u2019 products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nAny of Kodak\u2019s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States.\nTherefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position. Also, some of Kodak\u2019s business and some of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nKodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks and require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak\u2019s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted and its reputation harmed by its licensees\u2019 activities. Also, failure by Kodak and its licensees to sufficiently exploit any of Kodak\u2019s trademarks in any markets could erode Kodak\u2019s trademark rights with respect to the relevant trademarks. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same degree as those in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.\nKodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak\u2019s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.\nIn addition, the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit Kodak\u2019s ability to conduct its business. Other companies may hold patents on technologies used in Kodak\u2019s industries and some of these companies may be aggressively seeking to expand, enforce or license their patent portfolios. Third parties may claim Kodak and its customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak\u2019s access to certain markets. Additionally, certain individuals and groups have purchased intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business:\n\u2022\nclaims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nclaims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products;\n\u2022\neven if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party\u2019s contractual obligations; and\n\u2022\nif it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with some of its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any requirement to disclose Kodak\u2019s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.\nKodak\u2019s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.\nKodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nThe funded status of its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities, could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak\u2019s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nIn past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets, and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.\nKodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also determined the fair value of its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company\u2019s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak\u2019s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.\nKodak\u2019s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak\u2019s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations.\nEquipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak\u2019s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.\nIf Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nKodak uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels with various potential customer segments for its products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak\u2019s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak\u2019s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on its financial performance.\nKodak\u2019s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its sales in emerging markets.\nBecause Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, including in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:\n\u2022\nsupport of multiple languages;\n\u2022\nrecruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products;\n\u2022\ncomplexity of managing international operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncommercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition and the imposition of tariffs on products or raw materials imported into or exported from the U.S.;\n\u2022\nmultiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nlimitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;\n\u2022\nlimitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncomplications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability.\nThere can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed.\nAs a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.\nKodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nKodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations world-wide that govern, for example, the discharge of pollutants, the management of hazardous materials, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the composition and end-of-life management of its products. Non-compliance with applicable laws or liability incurred without regard to fault could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Any uncertainties related to environmental conditions or obligations at Kodak\u2019s properties may impact its ability to further develop or sell such properties.\nKodak may have additional tax liabilities.\nKodak is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining Kodak\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of its business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nKodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time for resolution. Management\u2019s ongoing assessments of the outcomes of these issues and related tax positions require judgment, and although management believes that adequate provisions have been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings and cash flow of Kodak.\nKodak\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted by legal matters.\nKodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations, remediations and proceedings concerning: commercial, tax, tort, customs, employment, health and safety and intellectual property matters, licensee activities, and compliance with various domestic and international laws and regulations. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak\u2019s products.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries.\nAs a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has designed its overall conflict minerals policies and procedures to be consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and continues to perform due diligence on its supply chain. Kodak filed its most recent Conflict Minerals Disclosure report for the reporting period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 on May 31, 2019. As of the date of the report, Kodak determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals but was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country. Kodak may incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide \u201cconflict-free\u201d minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak\u2019s supply chain is complex, it may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through its due diligence procedures, which may harm its reputation.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities.\nA breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the ABL Credit Agreement or the Convertible Notes could result in an event of default under these facilities.\nIf any default or event of default occurs under the ABL Credit Agreement and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility must, declare all of the Company\u2019s outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders must, terminate the lenders\u2019 commitments under that facility and cease making further loans. If any default or event of default occurs under the Convertible Notes and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the holders of the Convertible Notes, such holders may declare all of the Company\u2019s outstanding obligations under the Convertible Notes, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If applicable, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement and the collateral agent for the Convertible Notes could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes would likely have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due.\nOn March 6, 2020 Kodak obtained a waiver from the agent and lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement with respect to any event of default under the reporting covenant in the ABL Credit Agreement that may be deemed to occur in relation to the going concern explanatory paragraph contained in the audit report on Kodak\u2019s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that Kodak will be able to obtain such a waiver if a going concern explanatory paragraph is contained in the audit report with respect to Kodak\u2019s annual financial statements for future years. In the absence of such a waiver, the agent or lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement may take the position that such explanatory paragraph constitutes a default under the reporting covenant in the ABL Credit Agreement. For more information on the reporting covenants under the Credit Agreements and the potential impact of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report refer to Item 2. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Liquidity.\u201d\nKodak may require additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to it and/or may be limited.\nBecause of Kodak\u2019s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets is limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require it to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time or unattractive cost. The Company has issued approximately $80 million and $85 million of letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The maturity date of the ABL Credit Agreement is May 26, 2021. Upon the earlier of the maturity date or the termination of the revolving credit commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement, the obligations thereunder will become due and the Company will need to provide alternate collateral in place of the letters of credit issued under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nKodak\u2019s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ncovenants in the ABL Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes;\n\u2022\nobtaining a consent from the holders of Series A Preferred Stock for the issuance of additional preferred shares which rank senior or pari passu to the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates;\n\u2022\nits financial performance and projected financial performance and the financial performance and projected financial performance of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nits levels of debt and redemption obligations, including the maturity of the Convertible Notes on November 1, 2021, unless extended in accordance with their terms, and the mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock on November 15, 2021;\n\u2022\nits ability to generate positive cash flow;\n\u2022\nits ability to consummate monetization transactions including asset sales;\n\u2022\nits requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements;\n\u2022\nits credit ratings;\n\u2022\nits long-term business prospects; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions.\nKodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital is likely to limit its ability to meet its operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In particular, Kodak does not have committed refinancing or the liquidity to meet the debt obligations under the Convertible Notes and ABL Credit Agreement or the redemption obligations under the Series A Preferred Stock if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms, and there are no assurances Kodak will be able to amend, extend, refinance or repay the loans under the Convertible Notes, the redemption obligations under the Series A Preferred Stock or, as necessary, its obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement before they become due. If Kodak is unable to amend, extend or refinance the obligations under the Convertible Notes, ABL Credit Agreement or Series A Preferred Stock before they become due, its ability to continue as a going concern would likely be impaired.\nThe current non-investment grade status and Kodak\u2019s financial condition may adversely impact Kodak\u2019s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. In addition, the Company may not continue to maintain credit ratings from the recognized rating agencies.\nIts credit ratings and financial condition may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.\nIn carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Additionally, Kodak\u2019s current non-investment grade credit rating and financial condition may limit its ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance its debt obligations, including any mandatory redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock, or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs which would presumably be available to competitors with a higher or investment grade rating or stronger financial condition.\nShould its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced. In particular, given the Company\u2019s current credit ratings it would be required, if requested, to provide up to $13 million of additional letters of credit to the issuers of certain surety bonds to fully collateralize such bonds.\nThe availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak\u2019s cash.\nAvailability under the Company\u2019s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment and Eligible Cash less specified reserves as described in Note 9, \u201cDebt and Finance Leases\u201d to the consolidated financial statements. Kodak\u2019s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past four years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter. If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $80 million of outstanding letters of credit and the $15 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to increase restricted cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account or remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement\u2019s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement. Additional cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account would be classified as restricted cash and would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs.\nIf the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company. An event of default would occur under these circumstances if neither of these alternatives were achieved.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness under the Convertible Notes and ABL Credit Agreement and its other obligations including the potential mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following:\n\u2022\nit may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Convertible Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred;\n\u2022\nit could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, refinancing or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt or Series A Preferred Stock and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and\n\u2022\nadverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact.\nThe Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects, or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe conversion of the Convertible Notes or the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may dilute the value for the current holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion rate of 314.9785 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, and the 2,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion rate of 5.7471 shares of common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Notes or Series A Preferred Stock, the Company\u2019s existing shareholders will own a smaller percentage of its outstanding common stock. Based on the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 2020, the conversion of all Convertible Notes would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 42% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion, the conversion of all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion, and the conversion of all Convertible Notes and all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in the issuance to holders thereof of approximately 50% of the outstanding common stock after giving effect to such conversion. Further, additional shares of common stock may be issuable pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Notes and Series A Preferred Stock, with such issuances being further dilutive to existing holders of common stock.\nIf Convertible Notes or shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted into common stock, holders of such converted common stock will be entitled to the same dividend and distribution rights as holders of the common stock currently authorized and outstanding. As such, another dilutive effect resulting from the conversion of any issued and outstanding Convertible Notes or shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be a dilution to dividends and distributions.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock will not realize any dilution in their ownership, dividend or distribution rights solely as a result of the reservation of any shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or Series A Preferred Stock or for issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to certain other features of the Convertible Notes or Series A Preferred Stock, but will experience such dilution to the extent additional shares of common stock are issued in the future as described above.\nThe holders of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes own a large portion of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding securities and have the right to nominate two members to the Company\u2019s Board. As a result, these holders may influence the composition of the Board and future actions taken by the Board.\nThe holders of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote upon all matters upon which holders of the Company\u2019s common stock have the right to vote and are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of full shares of common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock could be converted at the then applicable conversion rate. These holders currently hold approximately 30% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis. These holders also hold all of the Convertible Notes. If the holders converted all of the Convertible Notes, the holders would hold approximately 56% of the voting power of the Company on an as-converted basis and such conversion may constitute a change in control of the Company. As a result, these holders may have the ability to influence future actions by the Company requiring shareholder approval. The Company and these holders are parties to a Shareholder Agreement that contains certain restrictions on disposition or acquisition of Company securities and other actions by these holders, some of which restrictions will expire on April 17, 2020.\nFurther, for as long as they hold any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate for election (collectively and not individually) at the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders a number of directors to the board of directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) commensurate with their ownership percentage of common stock on an as-converted basis. Two of the Company\u2019s current Board members were nominated by these current holders, who also have the right to fill vacancies on the Board created by one of their nominees ceasing to serve on the Board. The nomination and other rights regarding the Board granted to the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not transferrable to any other person.\nAlso, whenever dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more dividend periods, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting with holders of all other classes of preferred stock of the Company whose voting rights are then exercisable) are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors at the Company\u2019s next annual meeting and all subsequent meetings until all accumulated dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock and other voting preferred stock have been paid or set aside (during which time the number of directors the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to nominate under the Purchase Agreement will be reduced by two). As a result, the presence of directors on the Board nominated by the current holders of Series A Preferred Stock or elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock would enable such current holders or the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to influence the composition of the Board and, in turn, potentially influence and impact future actions taken by the Board. As of February 1, 2020, the Company is in arrears for four dividend payments.\nThe Company has registered the resale of a large portion of its outstanding securities. The resale of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the perception that such resale may occur, may adversely affect the price of its common stock.\nIn compliance with two Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is a party, it has registered the resale of an aggregate of 20,723,050 shares of outstanding common stock, 2,000,000 shares of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, and 11,494,200 shares of common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, issuable upon the conversion of outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. The Company is also a party to a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which it is obligated under defined circumstances to register for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. The resale of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such resale might occur, could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline. Under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreements to which the Company is subject, the counterparties to such Registration Rights Agreements can, in certain circumstances, require the Company to participate in an underwritten public offering of the registered securities. Any shares sold in a registered resale will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. While the Company cannot predict the size of future resales or distributions of its common stock, if there is a perception that such resales or distributions could occur, or if the holders of the Company\u2019s securities registered for resale sell a large number of the registered securities, the market price for the Company\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe resale of a significant portion of the Company\u2019s securities registered for resale or certain accumulations or transfers of the Company\u2019s securities could result in a change of control of the Company and the loss of favorable tax attributes.\nThe Company has registered the resale of securities representing approximately 59% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and, if it is required to register the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes, the Company will have registered the resale of securities representing approximately 74% of its outstanding shares of common stock assuming the issuance of all common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes.\nAlthough the holders of the subject securities consist of several unaffiliated groups, these holders collectively have a controlling influence over all matters presented to the Company\u2019s shareholders for approval, including election of members to the Board and change of control transactions. In addition, the holders of subject securities collectively would be able to cause a change of control of the Company by selling a sufficient portion of the Company\u2019s securities held by them.\nIf such a transaction, in combination with other transactions including the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes, the conversion of such securities, the redemption, refinancing, extension or amendment of the Series A Preferred Stock, or future issuances of securities by the Company, were to result in an \u201cownership change\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the Company\u2019s ability to offset taxable income with tax attributes generated prior to the ownership change date could be limited, possibly substantially. For more information on the Company\u2019s tax attributes refer to Note 18, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d. The interests of the holders of the securities registered for resale may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning the Company, its strategic initiatives, its sales and profitability, and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations and sales of large blocks of its common stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially.", "PERMNO": 14276, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "KODK"}
