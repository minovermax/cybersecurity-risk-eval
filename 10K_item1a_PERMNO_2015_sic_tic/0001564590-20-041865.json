Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe were incorporated in 2006 and have mostly experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. We generated net losses of $31.1 million, $7.3 million and $7.2 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $148.7 million. While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of subscription and transaction fee revenue to sustain or increase our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we intend to continue to expend significant funds to further develop our platform, including introducing new products and functionality, and to expand our marketing programs and sales teams to drive new customer adoption, expand strategic partner integrations, and support international expansion. Our profitability each quarter is also impacted by the mix of our revenue generated from subscriptions and transaction fees, on the one hand, and interest earned on customer funds that we hold in trust, on the other. Any changes in this revenue mix will have the effect of increasing or decreasing our margins. We will also face increased compliance and security costs associated with growth, the expansion of our customer base, and being a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for several reasons, including the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease.\nOur recent rapid growth, including growth in our volume of payments, may not be indicative of our future growth, and if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively. Our rapid growth also makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nOur revenue was $157.6 million, $108.4 million and $64.9 million, and our Total Payment Volume (TPV) was $96.5 billion, $71.3 billion and $49.6 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although we have recently experienced significant growth in our revenue and payment volume, even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect our growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the increasing scale of our business. Overall growth of our revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nprice our platform effectively to attract new customers and increase sales to our existing customers;\n\u2022\nmanage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations;\n\u2022\nexpand the functionality and scope of the products we offer on our platform;\n\u2022\nmaintain the rates at which customers subscribe to and continue to use our platform;\n\u2022\nmaintain payment volume;\n\u2022\ngenerate interest income on customer funds that we hold in trust;\n\u2022\nprovide our customers with high-quality customer support that meets their needs;\n\u2022\nintroduce our products to new markets outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nserve SMBs across a wide cross-section of industries;\n\u2022\nexpand our target market beyond SMBs;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform; and\n\u2022\nincrease awareness of our brand and successfully compete with other companies.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our future operating results. Further, the revenue that we derive from interest income on customer funds is dependent on interest rates, which we do not control. If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our market, or if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability. You should not rely on our revenue from any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue or payment growth.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\nsales, marketing and customer success, including an expansion of our sales organization and new customer success initiatives;\n\u2022\nour technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance, and security;\n\u2022\nproduct development, including investments in our product development team and the development of new products and new functionality for our AI-enabled platform;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\ninternational expansion;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance and risk management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral administration, including increased legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, or if we encounter difficulties in managing a growing volume of payments, our business, financial position, and operating results will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability over the long term.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has materially impacted the U.S. and global economies, and could have a material adverse impact on our employees, strategic partners, and customers, which could adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern. In March 2020, the President of the United States (U.S.) declared a State of National Emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, many jurisdictions in the U.S. have limited social mobility and gathering. Many business establishments have closed due to restrictions imposed by the government and many governmental authorities have closed most public establishments, including schools, restaurants and shopping malls. Our customers have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the shelter-in-place and other similar state\nand local orders, the closure of manufacturing sites and country borders, and the increase in unemployment. These conditions will continue to have negative implications on demand for goods, the supply chain, production of goods and transportation. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, governments (at national, state and local levels), companies and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that could adversely impact consumer spending, global capital markets, the global economy and our stock price. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), almost all of our employees are currently working remotely, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, strategic partners, and customers. In addition, due to the recent emergency interventions of the U.S. Federal Reserve to stabilize the U.S. economy, interest rates have fallen sharply, which has adversely impacted our revenue from interest earned on funds held from customers and may continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, due to the \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders in the state of California and in the San Francisco Bay Area, construction on the buildout of our new facility was temporarily suspended for a period of time. The delay will shift the completion of the project to early calendar 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely impact the operations of our strategic partners and accounting firm partners, as well as those of our customers, our employees and our employee productivity. This direct impact of the virus, and the disruption on our employees and operations, may negatively impact both our ability to meet customer demand and our revenue and profit margins. We may experience delays or changes in customer demand, particularly if customer funding priorities change. Additionally, the disruption and volatility in the global and domestic capital markets may increase the cost of capital and limit our ability to access capital. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. For these reasons and other reasons that may come to light if the COVID-19 pandemic and associated protective or preventative measures expand, we may experience a material adverse impact on our business operations, revenues and financial condition as well as some of our underlying business drivers such as customer growth and payment and transaction volumes; however, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective to prevent fraudulent activities by our customers or their counterparties, which could expose us to material financial losses and liability and otherwise harm our business.\nWe offer software that digitizes and automates back-office financial operations for a large number of customers and executes payments to their vendors or from their clients. We are responsible for verifying the identity of our customers and their users, and monitoring transactions for fraud. We have been in the past and will continue to be targeted by parties who seek to commit acts of financial fraud using techniques such as stolen identities and bank accounts, compromised business email accounts, employee or insider fraud, account takeover, false applications, and check fraud. We may suffer losses from acts of financial fraud committed by our customers and their users, our employees or third-parties.\nThe techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform are continually evolving, and we expend considerable resources to continue to monitor and combat them. In addition, when we introduce new products and functionality, or expand existing products, we may not be able to identify all risks created by the new products or functionality. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. Furthermore, our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may contain errors or our employees or agents may commit mistakes or errors in judgment as a result of which we may suffer large financial losses. The software-driven and highly automated nature of our platform could enable criminals and those committing fraud to steal significant amounts of money from businesses like ours. As greater numbers of customers use our platform, our exposure to material risk losses from a single customer, or from a small number of customers, will increase.\nOur current business and anticipated domestic and international growth will continue to place significant demands on our risk management efforts, and we will need to continue developing and improving our existing risk management infrastructure, policies, procedures, techniques, and processes. As techniques used to perpetrate fraud on our platform evolve, we may need to modify our products or services to mitigate fraud risks. As our business grows and becomes more complex, we may be less able to forecast and carry appropriate reserves in our books for fraud related losses. Further, these types of fraudulent activities on our platform can also expose us to civil and criminal liability, governmental and regulatory sanctions as well as potentially cause us to be in breach of our contractual obligations to our third-party partners.\nWe transfer large sums of customer funds daily, and are subject to the risk of errors, which could result in financial losses, damage to our reputation, or loss of trust in our brand, which would harm our business and financial results.\nFor fiscal 2020, over 98,000 customers processed approximately $96.5 billion in TPV on our platform. We have grown rapidly and seek to continue to grow, and although we maintain a robust and multi-faceted risk management process, our business is always subject to the risk of financial losses as a result of credit losses, operational errors, software defects, service disruption, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions or errors on our platform. As a provider of accounts payable, accounts receivable, and payment solutions, we collect and transfer funds on behalf of our customers. Software errors in our platform and operational errors by our employees may also expose us to losses.\nMoreover, our trustworthiness and reputation are fundamental to our business. As a provider of cloud-based software for complex back-office financial operations, the occurrence of any credit losses, operational errors, software defects, service disruption, employee misconduct, security breaches, or other similar actions or errors on our platform could result in financial losses to our business and our customers, loss of trust, damage to our reputation, or termination of our agreements with strategic partners and accountants, each of which could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our platform;\n\u2022\nlegal claims against us, including warranty and service level agreement claims;\n\u2022\nregulatory enforcement action; or\n\u2022\ndiversion of our resources, including through increased service expenses or financial concessions, and increased insurance costs.\nAlthough our terms of service allocate to our customers the risk of loss resulting from our customers\u2019 errors, omissions, employee fraud, or other fraudulent activity related to their systems, in some instances we may cover such losses for efficiency or to prevent damage to our reputation. Although we maintain insurance to cover losses resulting from our errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all losses or our coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses. If we suffer significant losses or reputational harm as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCustomer funds that we hold in trust are subject to market, interest rate, foreign exchange, and liquidity risks, as well as general political and economic conditions. The loss of these funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe invest funds that we hold in trust for our customers, including funds being remitted to suppliers, in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. Nevertheless, our customer fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, and liquidity risks. These risks may be exacerbated, individually or in aggregate, during periods of heavy financial market volatility. In the event of a global financial crisis, such as that experienced in 2008 and such as that which may result from the COVID-19 or other pandemics, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our business. As a result, we could be faced with a severe constriction of the availability of liquidity, which could impact our ability to fulfill our obligations to move customer money to its intended recipient. Additionally, we rely upon certain banking partners and third parties to originate ACH payments, process checks, execute wire transfers, and issue virtual cards, which could be similarly affected by a liquidity shortage and further exacerbate our ability to operate our business. Any loss of or inability to access customer funds could have an adverse impact on our cash position and results of operations, could require us to obtain additional sources of liquidity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are licensed as a money transmitter in all required U.S. states. In certain jurisdictions where we operate, we are required to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of all customer balances. Our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings, we will need to scale our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers\u2019 balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to accurately manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products, and result in significant penalties and fines, possibly including the loss of our state money transmitter licenses, which would materially harm our business.\nWe earn revenue from interest earned on customer funds held in trust while payments are clearing, which is subject to market conditions and may decrease as customers\u2019 adoption of electronic payments and technology continues to evolve.\nFor fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated $21.2 million, $22.4 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in revenue from interest earned on funds held in trust on behalf of customers while payment transactions are clearing, or approximately 13%, 21% and 12% of our total revenue for such periods, respectively. While these payments are clearing, we deposit the funds in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, and generate revenue that is correlated to the federal funds rate. When interest rates decrease, the amount of revenue we generate from these investments decreases. Additionally, because we process electronic payments faster than checks, we hold customer funds for a shorter time and consequently, earn less revenue. If our customers transition from checks to electronic payments faster than we anticipate, or to new, faster payment rails like The Clearing House\u2019s Real Time Payments Network, our revenue could decrease and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers or convert trial customers into paying customers, our revenue growth and operating results will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must continue to attract new customers and increase sales to those customers. As our market matures, product and service offerings evolve, and competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with our platform, our ability to sell subscriptions could be impaired. Similarly, our subscription sales could be adversely affected if customers or users perceive that features incorporated into alternative products reduce the need for our platform or if they prefer to purchase products that are bundled with solutions offered by other companies.\nFurther, in an effort to attract new customers, we may offer simpler, lower-priced products, which may reduce our profitability. In late March 2020, we implemented a short-term initiative to help new customers negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic by offering them a three-month free subscription, in addition to our standard 30-day risk-free trial. Additionally, we offered our existing customers a discount on user fees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these initiatives did not materially impact our results of operations for fiscal 2020, we anticipate that our subscription fees may be negatively impacted by these initiatives in the future, which may reduce our profitability.\nWe rely upon our marketing strategy of offering risk-free trials of our platform and other digital marketing strategies to generate sales opportunities. Many of our customers start a risk-free trial of our service. Converting these trial customers to paid customers often requires extensive follow-up and engagement. Many prospective customers never convert from the trial version of a product to a paid version of a product. Further, we often depend on individuals within an organization who initiate the trial versions of our products being able to convince decision makers within their organization to convert to a paid version. To the extent that these users do not become, or are unable to convince others to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy, and our ability to grow our revenue will be adversely affected. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to attract new customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, gross margins, and operating results.\nIf we are unable to retain our current customers or sell additional functionality and services to them, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, in addition to acquiring new customers, we must continue to retain existing customers and convince them to expand their use of our platform by increasing the number of users and incenting them to pay for additional functionality. Our ability to retain our customers and increase their usage could be impaired for a variety of reasons, including customer reaction to changes in the pricing of our products or the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, we may be unable to retain existing customers or increase the usage of our platform by them, which would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, gross margins, and other operating results, and accordingly, on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur ability to sell additional functionality to our existing customers may require more sophisticated and costly sales efforts, especially for our larger customers with more senior management and established procurement functions. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase additional products from us depends on several factors, including general economic conditions and the pricing of additional product functionality. If our efforts to sell additional functionality to our customers are not successful, our business and growth prospects would suffer.\nWhile some of our contracts are non-cancelable annual subscription contracts, most of our contracts with customers and accounting firms primarily consist of open-ended arrangements that can be terminated by either party without penalty at any time. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform after the expiration of their subscription period. For us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers continue to maintain their subscriptions on the same or more favorable terms. We cannot accurately predict renewal or expansion rates given the diversity of our customer base in terms of size, industry, and geography. Our renewal and expansion rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of several factors, including customer spending levels, customer satisfaction with our platform, decreases in the number of users, changes in the type and size of our customers, pricing changes, competitive conditions, the acquisition of our customers by other companies, and general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, or if they reduce their usage of our platform, our revenue and other operating results will decline and our business will suffer. If our renewal or expansion rates fall significantly below the expectations of the public market, securities analysts, or investors, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nOur business depends, in part, on our relationships with accounting firms.\nOur relationships with our nearly 5,000 accounting firm partners account for approximately 51% of our total customers as of June 30, 2020 and 46% of our total revenue for fiscal 2020. We market and sell our products and services through accounting firms. We also have a partnership with CPA.com to market our products and services to accounting firms, which then enroll their customers directly onto our platform. Although our relationships with accounting firms are independent of one another, if our reputation in the accounting industry more broadly were to suffer, or if we were unable to establish relationships with new accounting firms and grow our relationships with existing accounting firm partners, our growth prospects would weaken and our business, financial position, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends, in part, on our strategic partnerships with financial institutions.\nTo grow our business, we will seek to expand our relationships with our financial institution partners and to partner with additional banks and financial institutions. Establishing our strategic partner relationships, particularly with our financial institution customers and, to a lesser extent, accounting software providers, entails extensive and highly specific upfront sales efforts, with little predictability and various ancillary requirements. For example, our financial institution partners generally require us to submit to an exhaustive security audit, given the sensitivity and importance of storing their customer billing and payment data on our platform. As a result, sales to new strategic partner enterprises involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to SMB organizations. With strategic partners, the decision to subscribe to our platform frequently requires the approval of multiple management personnel and more technical personnel than would be typical of a smaller organization. Accordingly, sales to strategic partners may require us to invest more time educating and selling to these potential customers. Purchases by strategic partners are also frequently subject to budget constraints and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays, including considerable efforts to negotiate and document relationships with them. Further, we integrate our platform with our financial institution partners\u2019 own websites and apps, which requires significant time and resources to design and deploy even after sales have been processed and documented. If we are unable to increase sales of our platform to strategic partners and manage the costs associated with marketing our platform to such customers and integrating with their systems, our business, financial position, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to attract new financial institution strategic partners if our potential partners favor our competitors\u2019 products or services over our platform or choose to compete with our products directly. Further, many of our existing financial institution partners have greater resources than we do and could choose to develop their own solutions to replace ours. Moreover, certain financial institutions may elect to focus on other market segments, and decide to terminate their SMB-focused services. For example, in late 2018, one of our former financial institution partners chose not to renew its relationship with us due to a change in business strategy. As a result, we lost approximately 5,000 customers. Although these customers did not represent a significant amount of revenue for our business, there can be no guarantee that other financial institution partners will not choose to terminate their relationships for strategic or other reasons. If we are unsuccessful in establishing, growing, or maintaining our relationships with strategic partners, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on our relationship with Intuit.\nIn addition to our relationship with financial institutions, we rely on our strategic relationship with Intuit Inc., a leading provider of financial, accounting, and tax preparation software, to further expand our business. Our platform is integrated into Intuit\u2019s QuickBooks product, which millions of SMBs rely on for accounting services. Achieving this integration required extensive coordination and commitment of time and resources, and has led to thousands of additional customers for us. We recently amended our agreement with Intuit to extend the term by three years until June 26, 2023, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. The revised agreement will enable us to continue supporting our platform within QuickBooks; in addition, we will be able to jointly market and promote our standalone offering, which includes advanced payment and workflow automation capabilities, to customers of Intuit\u2019s QuickBooks Online Advanced product. If we are unable to increase adoption of our platform by Intuit\u2019s\ncustomers, however, our growth prospects may be adversely affected. Additionally, if Intuit reconfigures its platform in a manner that no longer supports our integration with QuickBooks, we would lose customers and our business would be adversely affected. Finally, Intuit may seek to develop a solution of its own, acquire a solution to compete with ours, or decide to partner with a competitor and build a new product, which its SMB customers may select over ours, thereby harming our growth prospects and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for financial back-office solutions is fragmented, competitive, and constantly evolving. Our competitors range from large entities that predominantly focus on enterprise resource planning solutions, to smaller niche suppliers of solutions that focus exclusively on document management, workflow management, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and/or electronic bill presentment and payment. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment will remain intense going forward. Our competitors that currently focus on enterprise solutions may offer products to SMBs that compete with ours. Accounting software providers, such as Intuit, as well as the financial institutions with which we partner, may internally develop products, acquire existing, third-party products, or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their product offerings to compete with our platform or provide more comprehensive offerings than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale than us. These software providers and financial institutions may have the operating flexibility to bundle competing solutions with other offerings, including offering them at a lower price or for no additional cost to customers as part of a larger sale. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships. As we look to market and sell our platform to potential customers or strategic partners with existing solutions, we must convince their internal stakeholders that our platform is superior to their current solutions.\nWe compete on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct features, quality, and functionality;\n\u2022\ndata asset size and ability to leverage artificial intelligence to grow faster and smarter;\n\u2022\nease of deployment;\n\u2022\nease of integration with leading accounting and banking technology infrastructures;\n\u2022\nability to automate processes;\n\u2022\ncloud-based delivery architecture;\n\u2022\nadvanced security and control features;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance leadership, as evidenced by money transmitter licenses in all required US jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nbrand recognition; and\n\u2022\npricing and total cost of ownership.\nOur competitors vary in size, breadth, and scope of the products and services offered. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets, and greater resources than us. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, and customer requirements. For example, an existing competitor or new entrant could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our platform.\nFor these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and this competition could result in the failure of our platform to continue to achieve or maintain market acceptance, any of which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our platform with popular accounting software solutions or offerings of our strategic partners, our revenue and growth prospects will decline.\nTo deliver a comprehensive solution, our platform integrates with popular accounting software providers including Intuit QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite, and Sage Intacct, through application program interfaces (APIs) made available by these software providers. We automatically synchronize customers, suppliers, clients, invoices, and payment transactions between our platform and these systems. This two-way sync eliminates duplicate data entry and provides the basis for managing cash-flow through an integrated solution for accounts payables, accounts receivable, and payments.\nIf any of the accounting software providers change the features of their APIs, discontinue their support of such APIs, restrict our access to their APIs, or alter the terms governing their use in a manner that is adverse to our business, we will not be able to provide synchronization capabilities, which could significantly diminish the value of our platform and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe functionality and popularity of our platform depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our platform with the offerings of our strategic partners. Critically, our financial institution strategic partners must be able to integrate our platform into their existing offerings. These strategic partners periodically update and change their systems, and although we have been able to adapt our platform to their evolving needs in the past, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. In particular, if we are unable to adapt to the needs of our strategic partners\u2019 platforms, our strategic partners may terminate their agreements with us and we may lose access to large numbers of customers as a result.\nWe depend upon several third-party service providers for processing our transactions. If any of our agreements with our processing providers are terminated, we could experience service interruptions.\nWe depend on banks, including JPMorgan Chase, The Bancorp Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank, to process ACH transactions and checks for our customers. We have entered into treasury services or similar agreements with these banks for payment processing and related services. Those agreements include significant security, compliance, and operational obligations. If we are not able to comply with those obligations or our agreements with the processing banks are terminated for any reason, we could experience service interruptions as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new services.\nSimilarly, we have an agreement with Cambridge Mercantile Corp., under which Cambridge provides us with cross-border wire transfer capabilities. This arrangement has enabled us to offer our cross-border payments service, which we view as a significant growth opportunity for our business. Finally, we have an agreement with Comdata, Inc., under which Comdata acts as our program manager and card issuer processor for our virtual card program.\nIf any of our banking agreements related to ACH transactions or checks, or our agreements with Cambridge or Comdata are terminated, we may experience business interruptions and delays, and be forced to incur additional expenses, potentially interfering with our existing customer relationships or making us less attractive to potential new customers.\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by AWS or other third-party data centers or internet service providers could impair the delivery of our platform and our business could suffer.\nWe host our platform using third-party cloud infrastructure services, including co-location facilities at Equinix, Iron Mountain, and Digital West. We also use public cloud hosting with Amazon Web Services (AWS). All of our products utilize resources operated by us through these providers. We therefore depend on our third-party cloud providers\u2019 ability to protect their data centers against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, and similar events. Our operations depend on protecting the cloud infrastructure hosted by such providers by maintaining their respective configuration, architecture, and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and transmitted by third-party internet service providers. We have periodically experienced service disruptions in the past, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience\ninterruptions or delays in our service in the future. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the data storage services we use. Although we have disaster recovery plans that utilize multiple data storage locations, any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, military actions, terrorist attacks, negligence, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our platform. Any prolonged service disruption affecting our platform for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. System failures or outages, including any potential disruptions due to significantly increased global demand on certain cloud-based systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur platform is accessed by many customers, often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our customers and products available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of data centers, internet service providers, or other third-party service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to grow our business and scale our operations. If our third-party infrastructure service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to data centers, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services\nMoreover, we are in the process of gradually migrating our systems from internal data centers and smaller vendors to AWS. AWS provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. We have a limited history of operating on AWS. As we migrate our data from our servers to AWS\u2019 servers, we may experience some duplication and incur additional costs. If our data migration is not successful, or if AWS unexpectedly terminates our agreement, we would be forced to incur additional expenses to locate an alternative provider and may experience outages or disruptions to our service. Any service disruption affecting our platform during such migration or while operating on the AWS cloud infrastructure could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe operate in an emerging and evolving market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. If our market does not grow as we expect, or if we cannot expand our platform to meet the demands of this market, our revenue may decline or fail to grow, and we may incur additional operating losses.\nOur primary competition remains the legacy manual processes that SMBs have relied on for generations. Our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the widespread adoption of our cloud-based back-office solutions as an alternative to existing solutions or adoption by customers that are not using any such solutions at all. Some organizations may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform for several reasons, including concerns about additional costs, uncertainty regarding the reliability and security of cloud-based offerings, or lack of awareness of the benefits of our platform. Our ability to expand sales of our platform depends on several factors, including prospective customers\u2019 awareness of our platform, the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of enhancements to our platform or new products that we may introduce, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, the costs of our platform, and the success of our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our platform, or if organizations do not perceive or value the benefits of our platform as an alternative to legacy systems, the market for our platform may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would harm our growth prospects and operating results.\nPayments and other financial services-related regulations and oversight are material to our business. Our failure to comply could materially harm our business.\nThe local, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards that govern our business include, or may in the future include, those relating to banking, deposit-taking, cross-border and domestic money transmission, foreign exchange, payments services (such as money transmission, payment processing, and settlement services), anti-money laundering, combating terrorist financing, escheatment, international sanctions regimes, and compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect cardholder data. We do not directly collect or store payment card information; instead, we rely on a third-party payment processor to do so. These laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards are enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States, including the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the SEC, self-regulatory organizations, and numerous state and local agencies. As we expand into new jurisdictions, the number of foreign laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards governing our business will expand as well. In addition, as our business and products continue to develop and expand, we may become subject to additional laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards. We may not always be able to accurately predict the scope or applicability of certain laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, or standards to our business, particularly as we expand into new areas of operations, which could have a significant negative effect on our existing business and our ability to pursue future plans.\nOur subsidiary, Bill.com, LLC, has obtained licenses or made registrations, as applicable, to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the United States, in the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, to the best of our knowledge, in all the states where such licensure or registration is required for our business. As a licensed money transmitter, we are subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, minimum capital requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies concerning various aspects of our business. Evaluation of our compliance efforts, as well as the questions of whether and to what extent our products and services are considered money transmission, are matters of regulatory interpretation and could change over time. In the past, regulators have identified violations and we have been subject to fines and other penalties by regulatory authorities due to their interpretations and applications to our business of their respective state money transmission laws. Regulators and third-party auditors have also identified gaps in our anti-money laundering program. In the future, as a result of the regulations applicable to our business, we could be subject to investigations and resulting liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other sanctions, and we could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of our business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses, and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses, certifications, and approvals, and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our products or services in any given market.\nGovernment agencies may impose new or additional rules on money transmission, including regulations that:\n\u2022\nprohibit, restrict, and/or impose taxes or fees on money transmission transactions in, to or from certain countries or with certain governments, individuals, and entities;\n\u2022\nimpose additional customer identification and customer due diligence requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring;\n\u2022\nlimit the types of entities capable of providing money transmission services, or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;\n\u2022\nimpose minimum capital or other financial requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit or restrict the revenue that may be generated from money transmission, including revenue from interest earned on customer funds, transaction fees, and revenue derived from foreign exchange;\n\u2022\nrequire enhanced disclosures to our money transmission customers;\n\u2022\nrequire the principal amount of money transmission originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until paid;\n\u2022\nlimit the number or principal amount of money transmission transactions that may be sent to or from a jurisdiction, whether by an individual or in the aggregate; and\n\u2022\nrestrict or limit our ability to process transactions using centralized databases, for example, by requiring that transactions be processed using a database maintained in a particular country or region.\nIf we lose our founder or key members of our management team or are unable to attract and retain executives and employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business may be harmed.\nOur success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team and other key employees. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ren\u00e9 Lacerte, is critical to our overall management, as well as the continued development of our products, strategic partnerships, our culture, our relationships with accounting firms, and our strategic direction. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives and key employees, which could disrupt our business. Our senior management and key employees are employed on an at-will basis. We currently do not have \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees. Certain of our key employees have been with us for a long period of time and have fully vested stock options or other long-term equity incentives that may become valuable and are publicly tradable now that we are a public company. The loss of our founder, or one or more of our senior management, or other key employees, including due to illness resulting from COVID-19, could harm our business, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees or that we would be able to timely replace members of our senior management or other key employees should any of them depart.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, or if our support is more expensive than anticipated, our business and reputation could suffer.\nOur customers rely on our customer support services, which we refer to as customer success, to resolve issues and realize the full benefits provided by our platform. High-quality support is also important for the renewal and expansion of our subscriptions with existing customers. We primarily provide customer support over chat and email, with limited phone-based support. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if our support personnel or methods of providing support are insufficient to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to retain customers, increase adoption by our existing customers and acquire new customers could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers could be harmed. If we are not able to meet the customer support needs of our customers by chat and email during the hours that we currently provide support, we may need to increase our support coverage and provide additional phone-based support, which may reduce our profitability.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing business needs, requirements, or preferences, our products may become less competitive.\nThe market for SMB financial back-office solutions is relatively new and subject to ongoing technological change, evolving industry standards, payment methods and changing regulations, and changing customer needs, requirements, and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis, including launching new products and services. The success of any new product and service, or any enhancements or modifications to existing products and services, depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products and services, enhancements, and modifications. If we are unable to enhance our platform, add new payment methods or develop new products that keep pace with technological and regulatory change and achieve market acceptance, or if new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely than our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. Moreover, we may experience delays in the development and introduction of new products due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, modifications to our existing platform or technology will increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with existing or future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.\nIf the prices we charge for our services are unacceptable to our customers, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe generate revenue by charging customers a fixed monthly rate per user for subscriptions as well as transaction fees. As the market for our platform matures, or as new or existing competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may experience pricing pressure and be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers at prices that are consistent with our pricing model and operating budget. Our pricing strategy for new products we introduce, including our virtual card and cross-border payment products, may prove to be unappealing to our customers, and our competitors could choose to bundle certain products and services competitive with ours. If this were to occur, it is possible that we would have to change our pricing strategies or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, gross profits, and operating results.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our strategic partner agreements. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur agreements with our strategic partners typically contain service level commitments on a monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide these partners with service credits, up to 10% of the partner\u2019s subscription fees for the month in which the service level was not met. In addition, we could face contract terminations, in which case we would be subject to refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unexcused downtime under our agreements with our partners. Further, any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, revenue, and operating results.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs, and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our platform grows and we sign additional strategic partners, we will need to devote additional resources to improving and maintaining our infrastructure and computer network and integrating with third-party applications to maintain the performance of our platform. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support, risk and compliance operations, and professional services, to serve our growing customer base.\nAny failure of or delay in these efforts could result in service interruptions, impaired system performance, and reduced customer satisfaction, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower subscription renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, all of which could hurt our revenue growth. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to customers and could result in lost customer opportunities and lower renewal rates, any of which could hurt our revenue growth, customer loyalty, and our reputation. Even if we are successful in these efforts to scale our business, they will be expensive and complex, and require the dedication of significant management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel and any restrictions on the movement of personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy and growth plans.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for executive officers, software developers, compliance and risk management personnel and other key employees in our industry and location is intense and increasing. We compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing, and managing cloud-based software and payment systems, as well as for skilled legal and compliance and risk operations professionals. The current regulatory environment related to immigration may increase the likelihood that immigration laws may be modified to further limit the availability of H1-B and other visas. If a new or revised visa program is implemented, it may impact our ability to recruit, hire, retain or effectively collaborate with qualified skilled personnel, including in the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and payment systems and risk management, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do and can frequently offer such personnel substantially greater compensation than we can offer. If we fail to identify, attract, develop and integrate new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects would be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organizations, and to deploy our sales and marketing resources efficiently. Although we will adjust our sales and marketing spend levels as needed in response to changes in the economic environment, we plan to continue expanding our direct-to-SMB sales force as well as our sales force focused on identifying new strategic partners. We also dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including digital advertising through services such as Google AdWords. The effectiveness and cost of our online advertising has varied over time and may vary in the future due to competition for key search terms, changes in search engine use, and changes in the search algorithms used by major search engines. These efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business and operating results will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant increases in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate, and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs and advertising are not effective.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly those related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties, or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value of our business and decrease the price of our common stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our products.\nOur customers, their suppliers, customers and other users store personal and business information, financial information and other sensitive information on our platform. In addition, we receive, store, and process personal and business information and other data from and about actual and prospective customers and users, in addition to our employees and service providers. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and various state, local, and foreign agencies. Our data handling also is subject to contractual obligations and industry standards.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of data relating to individuals and businesses, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising, and other communications with individuals and businesses. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure, and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became operative on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. Many aspects of the California Consumer Privacy Act and its interpretation remain unclear, and its full impact on our business and operations remains uncertain. The laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security are evolving, can be subject to significant change, and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. While we believe that the products and services that we currently offer do not subject us to such laws or regulations in foreign jurisdictions, such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future.\nWithin the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance from those in existing EU data protection law and imposes direct obligations on data processors in addition to data controllers. EU data protection authorities have the power to impose administrative fines for violations of the GDPR of up to a maximum of \u20ac20 million or 4% of the data controller\u2019s or data processor\u2019s total worldwide global turnover for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher, and violations of the GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data controllers, customers, and data subjects. While we believe that the products and services that we currently offer do not subject us to the GDPR, the GDPR and other laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations or may be modified in the future, or modifications or enhancements that we make to our products may subject us to GDPR, or we otherwise may become, or have it asserted that we are, subject to the GDPR or other laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security. If we are, or are asserted to be, subject to the GDPR, we may need to take steps to cause our processes to be compliant with applicable portions of the GDPR, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement changes in a timely manner or without significant disruption to our business, or that such steps will be effective, and we may face the risk of liability under the GDPR.\nThe scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, as a result of the rapidly evolving regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. As a result of the laws that are or may be applicable to us, and due to the sensitive nature of the information we collect, we have implemented policies and procedures to preserve and protect our data and our customers\u2019 data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, or unauthorized access. If our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing, or customer communications fail to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations, or industry standards, we may be subject to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, and negative publicity, and could cause our application providers, customers and partners to lose trust in us, and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulations, rules, and other standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, rules, regulations, and other actual or alleged legal obligations, such as contractual or self-regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the functionality of our platform. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal, or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing, and consumer communications, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to develop and market new functionality and maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing, or disclosure of data, or additional requirements for express or implied consent of our customers, partners, or end users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to incur additional costs or modify our platform, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new functionality.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations, or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect the growth of our business. Furthermore, any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our operating results.\nWe, our strategic partners, our customers, and others who use our services obtain and process a large amount of sensitive data. Any real or perceived improper or unauthorized use of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation as a trusted brand, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe, our strategic partners, our customers, and the third-party vendors and data centers that we use, obtain and process large amounts of sensitive data, including data related to our customers and their transactions, as well as other data of the counterparties to their payments. We face risks, including to our reputation as a trusted brand, in the handling and protection of this data, and these risks will increase as our business continues to expand to include new products and technologies.\nCybersecurity incidents and malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and providers of cloud-based services have frequently been targeted by such attacks. These cybersecurity challenges, including threats to our own IT infrastructure or those of our customers or third-party providers, may take a variety of forms ranging from stolen bank accounts, business email compromise, customer employee fraud, account takeover, check fraud or cybersecurity attacks, to \u201cmega breaches\u201d targeted against cloud-based services and other hosted software, which could be initiated by individual or groups of hackers or sophisticated cyber criminals. A cybersecurity incident or breach could result in disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property, or cause production downtimes and compromised data. We have in the past experienced cybersecurity incidents of limited scale. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used in the future to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, third parties may increasingly seek to compromise our security controls or gain unauthorized access to our sensitive corporate information or our customers\u2019 data.\nWe have administrative, technical, and physical security measures in place, and we have policies and procedures in place to contractually require service providers to whom we disclose data to implement and maintain reasonable privacy, data protection, and information security measures. However, if our privacy protection, data protection, or information security measures or those of the previously mentioned third parties are inadequate or are breached as a result of third-party action, employee or contractor error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, software bugs or defects in our products, trickery, process failure, or otherwise, and, as a result, there is improper disclosure of, or someone obtains unauthorized access to or exfiltrates funds or sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, on our systems or our partners\u2019 systems, or if we suffer a ransomware or advanced persistent threat attack, or if any of the foregoing is reported or perceived to have occurred, our reputation and business could be damaged. Recent high-profile security breaches and related disclosures of sensitive data by large institutions suggest that the risk of such events is significant, even if privacy data protection, and information security measures are implemented and enforced. If sensitive information is lost or improperly disclosed or threatened to be disclosed, we could incur significant costs associated with remediation and the implementation of additional security measures, and may incur significant liability and financial loss, and be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, proceedings, and penalties\nIn addition, our financial institution strategic partners conduct regular audits of our cybersecurity program, and if any of them were to conclude that our systems and procedures are insufficiently rigorous, they could terminate their relationships with us, and our financial results and business could be adversely affected. Under our terms of service and our contracts with strategic partners, if there is a breach of payment information that we store, we could be liable to the partner for their losses and related expenses. Additionally, if our own confidential business information were improperly disclosed, our business could be materially and adversely affected. A core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our platform. Any perceived or actual breach of security, regardless of how it occurs or the extent of the breach, could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing partners or other customers, prevent us from obtaining new partners and other customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and implement measures to prevent further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability including those resulting from governmental or regulatory investigations, class action litigation, and costs associated with remediation, such as fraud monitoring and forensics. Any actual or perceived security breach at a company providing services to us or our customers could have similar effects. Further, as the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in a significant number of people working from home, these cybersecurity risks may be heightened by an increased attack surface across our business and those of our partners and service providers. We have heightened monitoring in the face of such risks, but cannot guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of those upon whom we rely and partner with, will be successful in preventing any such information security incidents.\nWhile we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient or may not cover all liabilities incurred by such attacks. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nWe currently handle cross-border payments and plan to expand our offering to new customers and to make payments to new countries, creating a variety of operational challenges.\nA component of our growth strategy involves our cross-border payments product and, ultimately, expanding our operations internationally. Although we do not currently serve customers outside the United States, starting in 2018 we introduced cross-border payments through our relationship with Cambridge Mercantile, and now offer our United States-based customers the ability to disburse funds to over 130 countries. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address payments to new countries. However, there is no guarantee that such efforts will have the desired effect.\nOur cross-border payments product and international operations strategy involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in financial regulations and our ability to comply and obtain any relevant licenses;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions;\n\u2022\nreduction in cross-border trade resulting from trade sanctions, other trade regulations, and relations;\n\u2022\npotential application of more stringent regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and the authorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information;\n\u2022\npotential changes in trade relations, regulations, or laws;\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), U.S. bribery laws, the UK Bribery Act, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tax laws.\nIf we invest substantial time and resources to further expand our cross-border payments offering and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, collaborations, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not such acquisitions are completed. In addition, we have no experience in acquiring other businesses, and we may not successfully identify desirable acquisition targets, or if we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate them effectively following the acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, as well as unfavorable accounting treatment and exposure to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims. We also may not generate sufficient financial returns to offset the costs and expenses related to any acquisitions. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results, and financial condition may suffer.\nWe use open source software in our products, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our products. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate it into their products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner under certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products. If we inappropriately use or incorporate open source software subject to certain types of open source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our products, we may be required to re-engineer such products, discontinue the sale of such products, or take other remedial actions.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, operating results, and financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Bill.com brand is important to support the marketing and sale of our existing and future products to new customers and strategic partners and to expand sales of our platform to existing customers and strategic partners. Our ability to protect our brand is limited as a result of its descriptive nature. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing and demand generation efforts, our ability to provide reliable products that continue to meet the needs of our customers at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our customers\u2019 trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and products, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform and products from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws, and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. While we have been issued patents in the United States and have additional patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Any of our patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. There can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or design around our patents. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours.\nNo assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or partners from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform.\nWe have been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.\nWe have been in the past and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes. Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management\u2019s time and attention. Although we carry insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot assure you that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nThe software industry is characterized by the existence of many patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the software industry are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. In addition, many companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Any litigation may also involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenue, and therefore, our patents may provide little or no deterrence as we would not be able to assert them against such entities or individuals. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop alternative technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our software or cease business activities related to such intellectual property. Any inability to license third-party technology in the future would have an adverse effect on our business or operating results and would adversely affect our ability to compete. We may also be contractually obligated to indemnify our customers in the event of infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend, and damaging to our reputation and brand.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, data protection, and other losses.\nOur agreements with strategic partners and some larger customers include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, data protection, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform or other contractual obligations. Some of these indemnity agreements provide for uncapped liability and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we normally limit our liability with respect to such obligations in our contracts with direct customers and with customers acquired through our accounting firm partners, we may still incur substantial liability, and we may be required to cease use of certain functions of our platform or products, as a result of IP-related claims. Any dispute with a customer with respect to these obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing or new customers, and harm our business and operating results. In addition, although we carry insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed, or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of customer data, and any such coverage may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nChanges to payment card networks fees or rules could harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with Mastercard, American Express, and Visa payment card network operating rules in connection with our virtual card payments service and our subscription billing engine. We have agreed to reimburse our service providers for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us. We may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations. The payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. We also may seek to introduce other card-related products in the future, which would entail additional operating rules. As a result of any violations of rules, new rules being implemented, or increased fees, we could lose our ability to make payments using virtual cards, or such payments could become prohibitively expensive for us or for our customers. If we are unable to make customer payments to vendors using virtual cards, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.\nOur success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business. We are subject to a wide variety of local, state, federal, and international laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. These laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards govern numerous areas that are important to our business. In addition to the payments and financial services-related regulations, and the privacy, data protection, and information security-related laws described elsewhere, our business is also subject to, without limitation, rules and regulations applicable to: securities, labor and employment, immigration, competition, and marketing and communications practices. Laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and standards applicable to our business are subject to changes and evolving interpretations and application, including by means of legislative changes and/or executive orders, and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business and the way we conduct our operations, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative, and other developments, and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products, and services and/or increase our cost of doing business.\nAlthough we have a compliance program focused on the laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards that we have assessed as applicable to our business and we are continually investing more in this program, there can be no assurance that our employees or contractors will not violate such laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, and industry standards. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, industry standards, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, standards or orders), may:\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, license suspension or revocation, forfeiture of significant assets, audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal, state, local or foreign regulators, state attorneys general and private plaintiffs who may be acting as private attorneys general pursuant to various applicable federal, state, and local laws;\n\u2022\nresult in additional compliance and licensure requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease regulatory scrutiny of our business; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our operations and force us to change our business practices or compliance program, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements.\nThe complexity of U.S. federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the scope of our international operations and the evolving regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to many overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions.\nAny of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation as a trusted provider, damage our brands and business, cause us to lose existing customers, prevent us from obtaining new customers, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to avert further breaches, expose us to legal risk and potential liability, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, sales of subscriptions to our products, and usage-based transaction fees. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. The trading prices for our common stock and other technology companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $265.8 million and $203.5 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively, that are available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal and state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2026. As of June 30, 2020, approximately $166.0 million of the federal NOL carryforwards do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely until utilized. As of June 30, 2020, we had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $10.6 million and $8.7 million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2027. The state tax credits do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely until utilized. In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset future taxable income or income tax. If it is determined that we have in the past experienced an ownership change, or if we undergo one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, then our ability to utilize NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes could be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 or 383 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs, even if we were to achieve profitability.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. The CARES Act changes certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The CARES Act did not have material impact on our financial statements due to our historical losses and valuation allowance positions. Any future changes in tax laws could impact our ability to utilize NOLs in future years and may result in greater tax liabilities than we would otherwise incur and adversely affect our cash flows and financial position.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our customers would have to pay for our offering and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe vast majority of states have considered or adopted laws that impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. States where we have nexus may require us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdiction. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States recently ruled in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al (Wayfair) that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. In response to Wayfair, or otherwise, states or local governments may enforce laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. We may be obligated to collect and remit sales and use tax in states in which we have not collected and remitted sales and use tax. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we historically have not or presently do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments or local governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a perceived competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing statutory tax rates in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the 2017 Tax Act as modified by the CARES Act;\n\u2022\nchanges to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and\n\u2022\nlimitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nAny of these developments could adversely affect our operating results.\nNatural catastrophic events, pandemics, and man-made problems such as power-disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches, and terrorism may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, pandemics such as COVID-19, or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. We have a large employee presence in the San Francisco Bay Area in California and a smaller presence in Houston, Texas, and our data centers are located in California and Arizona. The west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones and the Houston area frequently experiences significant hurricanes. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our products, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, as computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, we, and third parties upon which we rely, face increased risk in maintaining the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our solutions and related services and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our customers. Any computer malware, viruses, computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, phishing attacks, or other data security breaches related to our network infrastructure or information technology systems or to computer hardware we lease from third parties, could, among other things, harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nIn addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters, cyber-attacks, or other business interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. It may require significant resources and management oversight to maintain and, if necessary, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which would increase our costs and expenses. Furthermore, for fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our financial statement close process and reconciliation of funds held for customers. While no material weaknesses were identified in fiscal 2019 and 2020, there can be no assurance that we will not experience additional material weaknesses in the future.\nWe will also be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThis assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, provided that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the later of the date we are deemed to be an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d or a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d each as defined in the Exchange Act, or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. We will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff.\nWe are in the early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, including as a result of the material weakness described above, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported operating results and financial condition and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement of a change.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments involve the identification of performance obligations in revenue recognition, the valuation of the stock-based awards, including the determination of fair value of common stock, and the period of benefit for amortizing deferred commissions, among others. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn addition to intellectual property litigation, we have in the past and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims for reimbursement following misappropriation of customer data. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts, including those we have generated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of addressable users or companies covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our products at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platform and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, our forecasts of market growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nWe are subject to governmental laws and requirements regarding economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terror financing that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to criminal or civil liability if we violate them.\nAlthough we currently only operate in the United States, in the future we will seek to expand internationally and will become subject to additional laws and regulations, and will need to implement new regulatory controls to comply with applicable laws. We are currently required to comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and we have processes in place to comply with the OFAC regulations as well as similar requirements in other jurisdictions. As part of our compliance efforts, we scan our customers against OFAC and other watchlists. While we offer services only to customers domiciled in the United States, our application could be accessed from anywhere in the world. If our service is accessed from a sanctioned country in violation of the trade and economic sanctions, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action. We are also subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In the United States, most of our services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), and similar laws and regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money transmitters to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, to report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information about customers who use their services and maintain other transaction records. Regulators in the United States and globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor transactions on our system, including payments to persons outside of the United States. Regulators regularly re-examine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers, and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption laws. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public sector. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. Although we currently only maintain operations in the United States, as we increase our international cross-border business and expand operations abroad, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In\naddition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nWe cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas are received or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets, and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement (Senior Facilities Agreement) restricts our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nuse our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks, and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions, unless the value of the assets subject thereto does not exceed a certain threshold;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens upon our property;\n\u2022\ndispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or make certain distributions; and\n\u2022\nundergo a merger or consolidation or other transactions.\nOur Senior Facilities Agreement also prohibits us during certain covered time periods from allowing Net Revenue (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) for any fiscal quarter to be less than prescribed minimums. Our ability to comply with this and other covenants is dependent upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants or payment requirements, or the occurrence of other events specified in our Senior Facilities Agreement, could result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which would give our lenders the right to terminate its commitments to provide additional loans under the Senior Facilities Agreement and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, we have granted our lenders first-priority liens against all of our assets as collateral. Failure to comply with the covenants or other restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement could result in a default. If the debt under our Senior Facilities Agreement was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the platform that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected.\nWe expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our operating results, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our operating results include the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for or pricing of our platform;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and grow engagement with our existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, strategic partners, vendors, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our relationships with our accounting firm partners, financial institution partners, and accounting software partners, or identify and attract new partners;\n\u2022\ncustomer expansion rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preference for cloud-based services as a result of security breaches in the industry or privacy concerns, or other security or reliability concerns regarding our products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations or delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\npotential and existing customers choosing our competitors\u2019 products or developing their own solutions in-house;\n\u2022\nthe development or introduction of new platforms or services that are easier to use or more advanced than our current suite of services, especially related to the application of artificial intelligence-based services;\n\u2022\nour failure to adapt to new forms of payment that become widely accepted, including cryptocurrency;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or retention of more entrenched or rival services in the international markets where we compete;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses, including commissions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments, and other non-cash charges;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training, and integrating new employees, and retaining and motivating existing employees;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in market interest rates, which impacts interest earned on funds held for customers;\n\u2022\nthe effects of acquisitions and their integration;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our market;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform; and\n\u2022\nawareness of our brand and our reputation in our target markets.\nAny of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our operating results to vary significantly. In addition, we expect to incur significant additional expenses due to the increased costs of operating as a public company. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be volatile, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nThe market for our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe global macroeconomic impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity related to the real or perceived quality of our platform, as well as the failure to timely launch new products and services that gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services, commercial relationships, or significant technical innovations;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, litigation involving our industry, or both;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our or other parties\u2019 products, services or intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\ninterpretations of any of the above or other factors by trading algorithms, including those that employ natural language processing and related methods to evaluate our public disclosures;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; and\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, and technology companies in particular, have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of June 30, 2020, our executive officers, directors, and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 29.5% of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, may be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our outstanding shares of common stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies or unless we decide to early adopt selected or all applicable revised accounting standards whereby early adoption is permitted. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors. In addition, if we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will no longer be able to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of December 31st, our second fiscal quarter, of such fiscal year.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. For example, if we do not adopt a new or revised accounting standard, our future operating results may not be as comparable to the operating results of certain other companies in our industry that adopted such standards. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, which we expect to further increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly compared to when we were a private company.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and securities analysts, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our management team and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume is heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, downgrade our common stock, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our follow-on public offering completed in June 2020, subject to certain exceptions, we, all of our directors and executive officers, certain affiliates, and the selling stockholders, agreed not to offer, sell, or agree to sell, directly or indirectly, any shares of common stock without the permission of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, (i) for a period of 90 days from the date of our prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on June 11, 2020 (prospectus) for us, and (ii) with respect to our directors and executive officers, certain affiliates, and the selling stockholders, if 60 days have elapsed since the date of the prospectus and we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020, the later of the 60th day after the date of prospectus and the date of such public release of our earnings results; provided that in no event will such period exceed 90 days from the date of the prospectus.\nWhen the applicable lock-up period described above expires, we and our security holders subject to a lock-up agreement will be able to sell our shares in the public market. In addition, the underwriters may, in their sole discretion, release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements prior to the expiration of the lock-up period. Sales of a substantial number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up agreements, or the perception that such sales may occur, or early release of the agreements, could cause our market price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nIn addition, there were 10,160,069 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding and vesting of RSUs as of June 30, 2020. Following our IPO, we registered all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options or other equity incentives we may grant in the future on a registration statement on Form S-8 for public resale under the Securities Act. The shares of common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options are exercised, subject to the lock-up agreements described above and compliance with applicable securities laws.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the holders of up to approximately 33,747,138 shares, or 42%, of our common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 19084, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "BILL"}
