{"cik": "1551986", "company": "Monster Digital, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred net losses of $6.2 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.1 million. In their report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. While management has a plan to fund ongoing operations, there is no assurance that its plan will be successfully implemented. As a result, an investor may lose the entire value of an investment in our company.\nOur operating results, gross margins, cash flow and ability to sustain profitability may fluctuate significantly in the future and are difficult to predict.\nOur operating results, gross margins, operating cash flow and ability to sustain profitability are based on a number of factors related to our industry and the markets for our memory storage products. We will have little or no control over many of these factors and any of these factors could cause our operating results, gross margins and ability to sustain profitability to fluctuate significantly. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022 competitive pricing pressures for the products we sell, including the timing and amount of any reductions in the average selling prices of our products and our ability to charge a premium for our higher performance products;\n\u2022 the growth of the markets for host devices that use data storage products;\n\u2022 our ability to control our operating expenses;\n\u2022 the timing and amount of expenses related to obsolescence and disposal of excess inventory and the difficulty of forecasting and managing our inventory levels;\n\u2022 the amount of price protection, volume incentive rebates, discounts, market development funds, cooperative advertising payments and other concessions and discounts that we may need to provide to some of our customers due to competitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022 changes in our product and revenue mix;\n\u2022 the extent to which our products, particularly our higher margin products, are accepted by the markets;\n\u2022 the timing of the collection of our accounts receivable;\n\u2022 the decision of our customers to return products or rotate their inventory;\n\u2022 the inability of suppliers to fully indemnify us should we be subjected to litigation;\n\u2022 the difficulty of forecasting sell-through rates of our products and their impact on inventory levels at our resellers if sell-through data is not timely reported to us, which may result in additional orders being delayed or reduced and inventory being returned;\n\u2022 increases in costs charged by our product suppliers or the failure of our suppliers to decrease the prices they charge to us when industry prices decline;\n\u2022 competing data memory standards, which displace the standards used in our products and our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022 the announcement or introduction of products and technologies by competitors; and\n\u2022 potential product quality problems which could raise returns or rework costs.\nIn addition, we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenues and gross margins. We incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenues. Our expenses are to a large extent fixed in the short term and we may not be able to adjust them quickly to meet a shortfall in revenues during any particular quarter. We also plan inventory levels based on anticipated demand for our products and on anticipated product mix. As we anticipate increased demand for certain products we increase our level of inventory, which results in increased risk if we inaccurately estimate anticipated demand. Any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses and planned inventories would decrease our net income or increase our operating losses and harm our financial condition. If we are unsuccessful in increasing revenues from our higher margin products and controlling our operating expenses, we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nAlso, we have generated significant negative operating cash flows since our inception and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We are required to expend significant dollars on inventory and marketing efforts prior to the receipt of cash from the collection of our accounts receivable. We expect that our negative operating cash flows will continue for the foreseeable future as we increase our product offerings and expand our customer base. While we have a factoring arrangement in place that assists in part, we require substantial additional funds to bridge the gap between the expenditure and receipt of funds. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we will continue to be limited in our business and expansion efforts.\nBecause we have a limited operating history, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our prospects and the potential value of our offered securities. We are confronted with the risks inherent in an early stage company, including difficulties and delays in connection with the acquisition and marketing of products, operational difficulties, and difficulty in estimating future development, regulatory, and administrative costs. If we cannot successfully manage our business, we may not be able to acquire and offer commercially viable products, generate future profits and may not be able to support our operations. It is possible that we will incur additional expenses and may incur losses in the further implementation of our business plan.\nIn addition, we have not had limited experience in sourcing and selling action sports cameras. We are uncertain as to whether our action sports cameras will ultimately achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect or at all. Given our lack of experience in the action sports camera market, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify the needs and preferences of customers and to adjust inventory mixes or marketing efforts that correspond to such needs and preferences; and we also cannot assure you that our action sports cameras will ultimately become commercially successful. In such circumstances, our business, growth prospects, financial condition and results will be adversely affected.\nOur strategic partnership with Monster, Inc. poses significant challenges for us, and if we are unable to manage this relationship, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into a multi-year license agreement with Monster, Inc. (the \u201cMonster License Agreement\u201d) under which we have the right to exclusively market certain products under the \u201cMonster Digital\u201d brand name. As of December 31, 2016, this list of permitted products consists of the following: action cameras and accessories (including virtual reality goggles), DRAM modules; USB flash drives; flash based SD, M2,MicroSD, CF, ProDuo, card products; SSD drive products; internal power supplies for PCs, cable memory and hybrid drives. The management of this business will adversely affect our revenues and gross margins if we are, among other things, unable to:\n\u2022 properly manage the use of Monster Digital brand;\n\u2022 control the sales and marketing expenses associated with launching the brand in new channels;\n\u2022 plan for anticipated changes in demand; and\n\u2022 effectively leverage the Monster Digital brand to achieve premium pricing and grow market share.\nWe have a number of obligations that we must fulfill under our agreement with Monster, Inc. to keep it in effect. These obligations include compliance with Monster, Inc. guidelines and trademark usage, customer satisfaction and the requirement that we meet target minimum royalty payments. As a result, Monster, Inc. may in the future have the right to terminate our license in its entirety. We were not in compliance with the royalty remittance policy for the fiscal periods referenced in the agreement nor with the installment payment terms of the $500,000 payment required for the continued use of the name \u201cMonster Digital, Inc.\u201d as a corporate, business and operating and as described below. If we were to lose the rights to sell products under the \u201cMonster Digital\u201d brand, our financial results would be significantly negatively impacted.\nWhile we will continue to seek to offer additional products bearing the \u201cMonster Digital\u201d brand, the consent of Monster, Inc. will be required in order to sell any additional products bearing the \u201cMonster Digital\u201d brand. While to date Monster, Inc. has granted its consent to all our additional products to be sold bearing the \u201cMonster Digital\u201d brand, there can be no assurance that it would similarly consent in the future. If we are unable to secure the consent of Monster, Inc. for the sale of future products bearing the \u201cMonster Digital\u201d brand our product offering will be limited which would substantially and adversely affect our future prospects.\nOur strategic partnership with Monster, Inc. does not restrict Monster, Inc. from offering its own line of action sports cameras or memory products.\nUnder the Monster License Agreement, Monster, Inc. itself may use (but not sublicense) the Monster mark and its M (stylized) mark (but not the Monster Digital mark) in connection with action sports cameras or memory and data storage products. Although Monster, Inc. must offer us the first right to supply such products on commercially reasonable terms under an arrangement similar to the Monster License Agreement, nothing limits the ability of Monster, Inc. to act as a competitor to us. Monster, Inc. has substantially more resources to exploit these markets than we do and their entry into our markets would substantially and adversely affect our future prospects.\nWe estimate that a significant percentage of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were derived from Monster, Inc.\u2019s introductions to buyers and retailers.\nWe believe that approximately 19% and 33% of our gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were derived from Monster, Inc.\u2019s introductions to buyers and retailers. Monster, Inc. is under no contractual obligation to continue making such introductions. There can be no assurance that Monster, Inc. will continue to introduce us to significant buyers and retailers or that any buyers and retailers previously introduced to us by Monster, Inc. will continue to order products at previous levels or at all.\nOur failure to successfully promote our brand and achieve strong brand recognition in our markets will limit and reduce the demand for our products.\nWe believe that brand recognition is critical to our success. We plan to increase our marketing expenditures to create and maintain prominent brand awareness. If we fail to promote our Monster Digital brand successfully, or if the expenses with doing so are disproportionate to any increased net sales we achieve, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Other companies, who may have significantly more resources to promote their own brands then we do, may not be aggressively promoting their brands. If they begin to more aggressively promote their brand or if our products exhibit poor performance or other defects, our brand may be adversely affected, which would inhibit our ability to attract or retain customers.\nWe need additional capital to adequately fund our future business objectives and we may not be able to obtain the amount of capital required, particularly when the credit and capital markets are unstable. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholder and could cause the price of our offered securities to fall.\nWe currently have minimal cash on hand and an accounts receivable factoring facility limited to $4.0 million. We will need substantial additional funding to achieve our goal of increasing sales of higher margin specialty products as a percentage of revenues. Our estimation of necessary future funding is based on our operating plan, which in turn is based on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. Should these assumptions prove incorrect, our financial resources may not be sufficient to satisfy our future minimum capital requirements and will be insufficient to adequately address our goal of increasing sales of higher margin specialty products as referred above.\nAny of the following factors could result in insufficient capital to fund our operations:\n\u2022 if our capital requirements or cash flow vary materially from our current projections;\n\u2022 if we are unable to timely collect our accounts receivable;\n\u2022 the loss of a key customer or a material reduction by a key customer in the range of inventory level of our products;\n\u2022 if we are unable to sell-through inventory currently in our sales channels as anticipated;\n\u2022 if we are unable to timely bring new successful products to market; or\n\u2022 if other unforeseen circumstances occur.\nWe do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or, if available, whether the terms of any financing will be favorable to us. The current worldwide financing environment is challenging, which could make it more difficult for us to raise funds on reasonable terms, or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholder may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future strategic opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated events, or meet our aforementioned goal of increasing sales of higher margin specialty products, all of which would harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if we are unable to raise additional capital, or cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient capital to operate our business as planned and would have to modify our business plan or curtail some or all of our operations.\nIn addition, pursuant to our equity incentive plan, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers, including officers, employees and service providers of our subsidiary. Future grants of, options and other equity awards and issuances of common stock under our equity incentive plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our offered securities.\nIf we are unable to develop or maintain the strategic relationships necessary to develop, sell and market products that are commercially viable and widely accepted, the growth and success of our business will be limited.\nWe may not be able to acquire and sell products that are commercially viable and widely accepted if we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price, performance and functionality requirements of data memory manufacturers, suppliers and customers. We must continue to collaborate closely with our customers, manufacturers, and other suppliers to ensure that critical development, marketing and distribution projects proceed in a coordinated manner. These collaborations are also important because our ability to anticipate trends and plan our future product offerings depends to a significant degree upon our continued access to strategic relationships we currently have with our manufacturers and suppliers. If any of our current relationships terminate or otherwise deteriorate, or if we are unable to enter into future relationships that provide us with comparable insight into market trends or access to new and enhanced products, offerings and technologies, we will be substantially hindered in our future business endeavors.\nWe depend exclusively on third parties to manufacture and supply all of our products. If third party manufacturers and suppliers are unable to timely deliver required quantities of our products at acceptable qualities and prices, we will not be able to meet customer demand for our products, which would adversely impact success of our business.\nWe do not own or operate a manufacturing facility and rely on third parties to manufacture, produce and supply all of our products. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers and suppliers. Our reliance on third party manufacturers and suppliers involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022 reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u2022 unavailability of, or delayed access to, next-generation or key products, processes or technologies; and\n\u2022 the failure of a key manufacturer or supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions.\nThese risks could result in product shortages or increase our costs of manufacturing, sourcing, assembling or testing our products which could result in failure to meet customers\u2019 expectations and damage our brand, which could result in lost sales. In addition, if third party manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture and deliver products of acceptable quality, at acceptable costs and in a timely manner, we would have to identify and qualify other third party manufacturers. This could be time-consuming and difficult and result in unforeseen operational problems and/or lost sales which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with any of our third party suppliers or manufacturers for our primary memory products or our iX32 flashdrive. Our current offerings of action sports cameras and our iX32 flash drive are currently sourced from sole source suppliers and while we believe there is an alternative supplier available for our iX32 flash drive, we do not currently have an alternative supplier for our action sports cameras. We have a formal arrangement with Shuoying Digital Science & Technology (China) Co., Ltd. to manufacture and source our current offerings of action sports cameras. If these suppliers stopped supplying these products on acceptable terms, or at all, or we experienced delays in receipt of such products from these suppliers, we would experience a significant disruption in our business until such time as we are able to find alternative sources. In such event our business and financial results would be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend exclusively on third parties for the research and development of products.\nThe products we market are subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. The future revenue growth of our business depends in large part on the development, market acceptance and performance of any new products we introduce in the marketplace. We do not have an internal research and development department. Instead, we rely on third parties for the research and development of new and enhanced products.\nAlthough we depend on various third parties for the introduction and acceptance of new products, we do not have long-term relationships with any of them. There can be no assurance that we will maintain existing relationships or forge new relationships, that we will continue to have access to significant proprietary products, processes and technologies, or that we will continue to have access to new competitive products, processes and technologies that may be required to introduce new products. If we are not successful in maintaining and developing new relationships or obtaining rights to market products with competitive technologies, we will become less competitive and our operations will suffer.\nA material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for products could have a significant impact on our business.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to successfully offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and that are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if we cannot maintain relationships with key customers based on our trade terms and conditions. In addition, our business would be negatively impacted if key customers were to significantly reduce or eliminate the range of inventory level of our products.\nIn our memory storage industry, products are typically characterized by average selling prices that historically decline over relatively short time periods. If we are unable to effectively manage our inventories, reduce our costs, introduce new products with higher average selling prices or increase our sales volumes, our revenues and gross margins will be negatively impacted.\nData memory products often experience price erosion over their life cycle due in large part to competitive pressures, customer demand and technological changes. In order to maintain gross profits for products that have a declining average selling price, we must continuously reduce costs, increase sales volume or introduce new products with higher gross margins. We must also successfully manage our inventory to reduce our overall exposure to price erosion. In our industry, prices have often fallen faster than costs which has resulted in margin pressure. Our customers may exert pressure on us to make price concessions or to match pricing of our competitors. Any reduction in prices by us in response to pricing pressure will hurt our gross margins unless we can reduce our costs and manage our inventory levels to minimize the impact of such price declines. There can be no assurance that the introduction of new products will assist in protecting gross margin.\nAs it relates to our SSD, CF and SD card and USB flash drive products, demand depends in large part on the demand for additional storage and storage upgrades in existing computer systems. The demand for computer systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for drives and flash memory in any given period. As a result, these markets have experienced periods of excess capacity, which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition. If more intense price competition occurs, we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which could result in lower average selling prices, revenue and gross margins. We expect that average selling prices and gross margins will also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of products and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products. In addition, rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence.\nIf we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices or increase the sales volume of our existing products, particularly higher capacity or premium products, or introduce new products with higher gross margins, our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected. This may negatively impact our anticipated growth in product revenues as well as our gross margins, particularly if the decline in our average selling prices is not matched by price declines in our supply costs.\nOur failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products, or to quickly adjust to forecast changes, would adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies.\nThe data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The variety and volume of products we offer is based in large part on these forecasts. Accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult in light of the volatility in global economic conditions. In addition, because many of our products are designed to be largely substitutable, our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors. As forecasting demand becomes more difficult, the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases. If our forecasts exceed actual market demand, then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases, which would impact our financial performance. If market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts, then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs, which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands.\nIf we do not effectively manage our inventory and product mix, we may incur costs associated with excess inventory or lose sales from not having enough inventory.\nWe operate in markets that are characterized by intense competition, supply shortages or oversupply, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence, all of which make it more challenging to effectively manage our inventory. If we are unable to properly monitor, control and manage our inventory and maintain an appropriate level and mix of products with our customers, we may incur increased and unexpected costs associated with this inventory. For example, if our customers are unable to sell their inventory in a timely manner, we may choose or be required to lower the price of our products or allow our customers to exchange the slow-moving products for newer products. Similarly, if we improperly forecast demand for our products, we could end up with excess inventory that we may be unable to sell in a timely manner, if at all. As a result, we could incur increased expenses associated with writing off excess or obsolete inventory. Alternatively, we could end up with too little inventory and we may not be able to satisfy demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships. Our risks related to inventory management are exacerbated by our strategy of closely matching inventory levels with product demand, leaving limited margin for error.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the consumer electronics industry and any future downturn could adversely affect our business.\nThe consumer electronics industry is highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The flash memory markets have in the past experienced significant downturns often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average sales prices. It is impossible to predict whether demand for our products will diminish or costs for any of our products will increase. Also our customers\u2019 demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates. For example, there has been a recent rapid growth in devices that do not contain a hard drive such as tablet computers and smartphones; this could affect demand for our SSD products. Any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions.\nWe believe that we must continually source and introduce new products, enhance our existing products and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including market and customer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments and inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. In addition, the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction, and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products and potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. If we are unable to introduce new products or novel technologies in a timely manner or our new products or technologies are not accepted by consumers, our competitors may introduce more attractive products, which could hurt our competitive position. Our new products might not receive consumer acceptance if consumer preferences shift to other products, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower revenue and excess inventory levels. As we seek to enhance our products, we may incur additional costs to incorporate new or revised features. We might not be able to, or determine that it is not in our interests to, raise prices to compensate for these additional costs. If we do not successfully manage product transitions, our revenue and business may be harmed.\nOur markets are extremely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Many of our significant competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, and one or more of these competitors could use their greater resources to gain market share at our expense.\nCompetition is based on a multitude of factors, including product design, brand strength, distribution presence and capability, channel knowledge and expertise, geographic availability, breadth of product line, product cost, media capacity, access speed and performance, durability, reliability, scalability and compatibility. Specifically, the performance, functionality, reliability and price of our products are critical elements of our ability to compete. We believe that we offer, and that our target consumers seek, products that combine higher levels of performance, functionality and reliability at prices competitive with other leading brand-name products. Also, market penetration, brand recognition and inventory management are also critical elements of our ability to compete. Most consumers purchase products similar to ours from off-the-shelf retailers such as a large computer, consumer electronics and office supply superstores. Market penetration in the industries in which we compete is typically based on the number of retailers who offer a company\u2019s products and the amount of shelf-space allocated to those products.\nOur existing competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have longer operating histories and have greater brand name recognition, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, broader product lines and longer standing relationships with retailers, distributors, OEMs and end users. As a result, these competitors may be able to better absorb price declines, ensure more stable supply, adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we may. Ultimately, this may lead to a decrease in our sales and market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from existing competitors and expect to face competition from future competitors that design and market similar or alternative data storage solutions that may be less costly or provide additional features. If a manufacturer of consumer electronic devices designs one of these alternative competing standards into its products, the digital media we manufacture, as currently configured, will not be compatible with that product and/or may cause our revenues to decline, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe substantially rely on distributors and retailers to sell our data storage products and our inability to control the activities of such retailers could cause our operating results and gross margins to fluctuate significantly.\nWe sell substantially all of our data storage products through distributors and retailers. Sales to distributors and retailers subject us to many special risks, including the following:\n\u2022 continued downward pricing pressure may necessitate price protection of the inventories of our products that many of our customers carry;\n\u2022 distributors and retailers may emphasize our competitors\u2019 products over our products or decline to carry our products;\n\u2022 loss of market share if the retailers that carry our products do not grow as quickly and sell as many digital media products as the retailers that carry the digital media products of our competitors;\n\u2022 loss of business or monetary penalties if we are unable to satisfy the product needs of these customers or fulfill their orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022 increased sales and marketing expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast our customer\u2019s orders, including, among other items, increased freight and fulfillment costs if faster shipping methods are required to meet customer demand;\n\u2022 reduced ability to forecast sales; and\n\u2022 reduced gross margins, delays in collecting receivables and increased inventory levels due to the increasing tendency for some retailers to require products be supplied on a consignment basis.\nAvailability of reliable sell-through data varies throughout the retail channel, which will make it difficult for us to determine actual retail product revenues until after the end of each of our fiscal quarters. Unreliable sell-through data may result in either an overstatement or understatement of our reported revenues and results of operations. Our arrangements with our customers also provide them price protection against declines in our recommended selling prices. We do not have exclusive relationships with our retailers or distributors and therefore must rely on them to effectively sell our products over those of our competitors. Our reliance on the activities of distributors and retailers over which we have little or no control could cause our operating results and gross margin, to fluctuate significantly.\nWe obtain many products from a limited number of suppliers, and if these suppliers fail to meet our supply requirement or cease production of our products, we may lose sales and experience increased costs.\nOur products inventory strategy is to maintain as little inventory as is necessary for the efficient operation of our business, which creates the risk that any shortage or delay in the supply of our products could harm our ability to meet demand. We obtain many of our products from a limited number of suppliers on a purchase order basis.\nFurthermore, none of our suppliers have a contractual commitment to supply us with products. These products include our SSDs, flash memory cards and USB flash drives. If demand for a specific product increases, we may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of that product in a timely manner, since our suppliers may fill other orders before ours. It could be difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain alternative sources for these products, or to change products, or to change designs to make use of alternative products. In addition, difficulties in transitioning from an existing supplier to a new supplier could create delays in product availability that would have a significant impact on our ability to fulfill orders for our products. This would adversely impact on our ability to meet demand and damage our brand and reputation in the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause we protect some of our retail customers and distributors against the effects of price decreases on their inventories of our products, we may incur price protection charges if we reduce our prices when there are large quantities of our products in our distribution channel.\nWe provide price protection to certain of our major resellers. In the past we have incurred price protection charges ranging from 2% to 5% of gross sales before giving effect to such changes for the fiscal periods presented in this report. Price protection allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when its published price is reduced. In an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products, price declines and channel promotions expenses are more likely to occur and, should they occur, are more likely to have a significant impact on our operating results. Further, in this environment, high channel inventory may result in substantial price protection charges. These price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margins. We anticipate that we may continue to incur price protection charges due to competitive pricing pressures and, as a result, our revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected.\nA significant product defect or product recall could materially and adversely affect our brand image, causing a decline in our sales and profitability, and could reduce or deplete our financial resources.\nA significant product defect could materially harm our brand image and could force us to conduct a product recall. This could damage our relationships with our customers and reduce end-user loyalty. A product recall would be particularly harmful to us because we have limited financial and administrative resources to effectively manage a product recall and it would detract management\u2019s attention from implementing our core business strategies. As a result, a significant product defect or product recall could cause a decline in our sales and profitability, and could reduce or deplete our financial resources.\nA substantial portion of our sales have been made to customers accounting for over 10% of sales. We expect that this may continue in the foreseeable future. If any of these customers fails to timely pay us amounts owed, we could suffer a significant decline in cash flow and liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, one customer accounted for 34% of our gross sales. For the year ended December 31, 2015, three customers accounted for over 10% of our gross sales. We expect that we may continue to depend upon a limited number of major customers for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. We expect the composition of our major customer base to change over time, as our markets and strategies evolve, which could make our revenue less predictable from period-to-period.\nOur agreements with our customers do not require them to purchase any specified number of products or dollar amount of purchases or to make any purchases whatsoever. Therefore, we cannot assure you that, in any future period, our sales generated from these customers, individually or in the aggregate, will equal or exceed historical levels. We also cannot assure you that, if sales to any of these customers cease or decline, we will be able to replace these sales with sales to either existing or new customers in a timely manner, or at all. A cessation or reduction of sales, or a decrease in the prices of products sold to one or more of these customers could cause a significant decline in our net sales and profitability.\nOur financial performance depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the related impact on levels of consumer spending, which have deteriorated in many countries and regions, including the U.S., and may not recover in the foreseeable future.\nDemand for our products is adversely affected by negative macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending. The tightening of consumer credit, low level of consumer liquidity, and volatility in credit and equity markets have weakened consumer confidence and decreased consumer spending primarily in the U.S. and European retail markets. A continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers and other computing and networking products, mobile devices, and flash memory cards. Reduced demand for our products could result in continued market oversupply and significant decreases in our average selling prices. A continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nNegative or uncertain global economic conditions could also cause many of our direct and indirect customers to delay or reduce their purchases of our products. Further, many of our customers in our distribution and retail channels rely on credit financing in order to purchase our products. If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers\u2019 access to credit, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. Likewise, our suppliers may face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses. These actions could result in reductions in our revenue, increased price competition and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. Companies in the technology and consumer products industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert claims in order to extract value from technology and consumer products companies. We do not currently manufacture any products and currently purchase all our products from third parties for resale. From time to time we may receive claims from third parties which allege that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights or we may be called upon to indemnify our customers for any intellectual property right infringements by us. If such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party or if we are found to owe license fees or royalties relating to these products, our margins and operating results would be severely negatively impacted.\nIn this regard, we received a letter from GoPro, Inc., or GoPro, alleging that we infringe on at least five U.S. patents held by GoPro, and requesting that we confirm in writing that we will permanently cease the sale and distribution of our 1080p action sports camera, along with any camera accessories, including the waterproof camera case and standard housing. The five patents specifically identified by GoPro in the letter were U.S. Patent No. D710,921: camera housing design, U.S. Patent No. D702,747: camera housing design, U.S. Patent No. D740,875: camera housing design, U.S. Patent No. D737,879: camera design, and U.S. Patent No. 721,395: camera design. Based upon our preliminary review of these patents, we believe we have some defenses to GoPro\u2019s allegations. Our outside counsel has been in discussions with GoPro\u2019s outside counsel and has forwarded them material which we believe supports defenses to these allegations, all in an effort to move the matter to resolution. But as of yet, there is no final resolution to this matter. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us.\nFurther, from time to time we may introduce new products and services, including in areas where we currently do not have an offering, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. Litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In the event of an adverse result in litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of some products, and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of some processes or obtain licenses to use the infringed technology. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur indemnification obligations to our customers for product defects could require us to pay substantial damages.\nA number of our product sales agreements provide that we will defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers from damages and costs that arise from product warranty claims or claims for injury or damage resulting from defects in our products. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all or any part of the claims asserted against us. A successful claim brought against us that is in excess of, or excluded from, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our executive officers were only recently appointed to their current roles and have a limited history of working together as a management group.\nIn December 2015, Jawahar Tandon stepped down as our Chief Executive Officer and David Clarke assumed that role; Mr. Tandon was appointed Executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Clarke has no previous experience in the management or operation of a company that engages in the business currently conducted and proposed to be conducted by the Company. In addition, in December 2015 Vivek Tandon stepped down as our President and Mr. Clarke assumed that position as well; Mr. Tandon was appointed Vice President, Operations. In October 2016 Jonathan Clark was appointed Interim President; Mr. Clark has no previous experience in the management or operation of a company that engages in the business currently conducted and proposed to be conducted by our company. Also, in January 2016, the Company appointed its Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing and an additional Vice President, Operations. In May 2016, Jawahar Tandon stepped down as our Executive Chairman of the Board but remained as a director. In August 2016, each of Vivek Tandon, Jawahar Tandon and Jonathan Orban stepped down as directors of the Company. As a result, our current management team has very limited experience working together as a management group which could cause short-term difficulties in implementing and overseeing significant corporate and operational functions.\nTo date, we have engaged in significant related party transactions.\nWe have adopted a policy that our executive officers, directors, nominees for election as a director, beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our common stock and any members of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons are not permitted to enter into a related person transaction with us without the proper consent of our audit committee. Further to such policy, any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, nominee for election as a director, beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and such person would have a direct or indirect interest, must first be presented to our audit committee for review consideration and approval. However to date, we have engaged in a substantial number of related party transactions prior to the adoption of such policy and all of which were approved by a board with no independent members. While the board believed the terms and conditions of such transactions was fair and in the best interests of our company, there can be no assurance that the transactions were on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nWe have limited human resources; we need to attract and retain highly skilled personnel; and we may be unable to manage our growth with our limited resources effectively.\nThe expansion of our business has placed a significant strain on our limited managerial, operational, and financial resources. We have been and will continue to be required to expand our operational and financial systems significantly and to expand, train and manage our work force in order to manage the expansion of our operations. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, train, and retain additional highly skilled executive level management with experience in the memory and data storage industry. Competition is intense for these types of personnel from more established organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, marketing, human, and other resources than we have. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. To date we have had to limit the engagement of critical management and other key personnel due in part to limited financial resources. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining these personnel, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. Further, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, to install new management information and control systems and to train, motivate and manage employees. If we are unable to manage growth effectively and new employees are unable to achieve adequate performance levels, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur international operations subject us to risks, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur international operations are exposed to the following risks, several of which are out of our control:\n\u2022 political and economic instability, international terrorism and anti-American sentiment, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022 preference for locally-branded products, and laws and business practices favoring local competition;\n\u2022 unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulations, and unexpected changes to those laws or regulations;\n\u2022 import and export license requirements, tariffs, taxes and other barriers;\n\u2022 costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u2022 increased difficulty in managing inventory;\n\u2022 less effective protection of intellectual property; and\n\u2022 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations.\nAny or all of these factors could adversely affect our ability to execute any geographic expansion strategies or have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, war, threats of war and government responses thereto may negatively impact our operations, revenues, costs and the market price of our securities.\nTerrorist attacks, U.S. military responses to these attacks, war, threats of war and any corresponding decline in consumer confidence could have a negative impact on consumer demand. Any of these events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. Any of these events could also increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers, or adversely affect consumer confidence. Turmoil and unrest in regions from which we source our products could cause delays in the development or production of our products. This could harm our business and results of operation.\nOur IT systems and operations are vulnerable because we have limited redundancy and backup systems.\nOur internal order, inventory and product data management system is an electronic system through which our customers place orders for our products and through which we manage product pricing, shipments, returns and other matters. This system\u2019s continued and uninterrupted performance is critical to our day-to-day business operations. Despite our precautions, unanticipated interruptions in our computer and telecommunications systems could occur in the future. We have extremely limited ability and personnel to process purchase orders and manage product pricing and other matters in any manner other than through this electronic system. Any interruption or delay in the operation of this electronic system could cause a significant decline in our sales and profitability.\nWe may make acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, our limited experience in acquiring other businesses, product lines and technologies may make it difficult for us to overcome problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions we may undertake.\nWe intend to evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including business combinations, strategic partnerships, and the purchase, licensing or sale of assets. In connection with any such future transaction, we could issue dilutive equity securities, incur substantial debt, reduce our cash reserves or assume contingent liabilities.\nOur experience in acquiring other businesses, product lines and technologies is limited. Our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions could divert the attention of management, utilize scarce corporate resources and otherwise harm our business. Any potential future acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies or products;\n\u2022 costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022 adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations; and\n\u2022 potential litigation arising from the acquired company\u2019s operations before the acquisition.\nFurthermore, acquisitions may require material charges and could result in adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any of which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nSudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations.\nWe generally ship our products to our customers, and receive shipments from our suppliers, via air or ocean freight. The sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes, such as due to labor difficulties or disputes, severe weather patterns or other natural disasters, or political instability, terrorism or civil unrest, could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore substantially all of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the United States, adversely affecting our business operations and financial results. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies, and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur share price is volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock currently is, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:\n\u2022 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 the level of expenses;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholder;\n\u2022 market conditions in the technology sectors; and\n\u2022 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of the shares of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nIn the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nPursuant to our decision to cancel our proposed acquisition of Syrma Technologies Pvt. Ltd., in September 2015 Jawahar Tandon, our former Executive Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer, and Devinder Tandon, one of our significant stockholder and a former director, offered in the aggregate to each stockholder who purchased shares of our company for cash the opportunity to receive .07 additional shares from Mssrs. Tandon\u2019s beneficial holdings for each .41 shares held by such stockholder (together the \u201cAdditional Shares\u201d). As a condition to such grant, the executing stockholder agreed to release our company and Westpark Capital from any claim or cause of action that arise out of or are related in any way to the purchase or acquisition of our common stock (the \u201cRelease\u201d). Stockholders holding an aggregate of 1,279,056 of such shares agreed to receive Additional Shares and sign the Release; an aggregate of 216,971 Additional Shares were afforded these stockholder from each of Jawahar Tandon's and Devinder Tandon\u2019s beneficial holdings. Stockholders holding an aggregate of 199,248 of such shares did not agree to receive any Additional Shares and did not sign the Release. As such, these stockholder have reserved rights to file claims against our company in connection with the issuance of securities to them, which claims may include claims that securities were sold to them in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While we have not received any notice that such a claim has been or is intended to be filed, no assurance can be given that any such claim will not be made against us or any of our officers or directors,. To the extent that any such claims or suits are brought and successfully concluded, we could be materially adversely affected, jeopardizing our ability to operate successfully. Furthermore, our human and capital resources of could be adversely affected by the need to defend any such actions, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our shares of common stock or warrants being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock or warrants less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares of common stock or warrants and the market price of such securities may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. We will cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (1) December 31, 2021, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses or if we fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 relating to the design and operation of our closing and financial reporting processes.\nFor a discussion of our remediation plan and the actions that we have executed during 2016 and 2015, in addition to the estimated costs incurred in connection with such remediation efforts, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\u201d The actions we have taken are subject to continued review, supported by confirmation and testing by management. While we have implemented a plan to remediate this weakness, we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate this weakness, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness, and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable Nasdaq listing requirements.\nOur failure to remediate the material weakness identified above or the identification of additional material weaknesses in the future, could adversely affect our ability to report financial information, including our filing of quarterly or annual reports with the SEC on a timely and accurate basis. Moreover, our failure to remediate the material weakness identified above or the identification of additional material weaknesses could prohibit us from producing timely and accurate financial statements, which may adversely affect our the market price of shares of our common stock and we may be unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of potential gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our shares of common stock and warrants will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of shares of our common stock or warrants to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our shares of our common stock. In November 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a selling stockholder providing for the issuance and sale to such investor of 333,333 shares of our common stock. The shares were sold subject to a registration rights agreement and we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1 on February 13, 2017. Commencing on January 7, 2017, approximately 5,000,000 shares of our common stock may be resold in the public market, most without restriction on volume, unless held by our affiliates. We have also agreed to register all 382,575 shares of common stock held by Monster, Inc. (upon demand) and all shares underlying warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering. All of the shares involved in an effective registration statement may be freely sold and transferred. We have also registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plan. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholder and may prevent attempts by our stockholder to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholder, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u2022 permit our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 additional shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022 require that any action to be taken by our stockholder must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholder and not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022 provide that stockholder seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholder or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholder must provide advance notice in writing, and also satisfy requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022 not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; and\n\u2022 provide that special meetings of our stockholder may be called only by the board of directors or by such person or persons requested by a majority of the board of directors to call such meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholder to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholder to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholder. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholder to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our shares of common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our common stock or warrants and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of our common stock and warrants will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our shares of common stock or warrants. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our shares of our stock and warrants would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our shares of common stock or warrants would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the trading price of our shares of common stock and trading volume to decline.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report, including the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness,\u201d contains forward-looking statements.
