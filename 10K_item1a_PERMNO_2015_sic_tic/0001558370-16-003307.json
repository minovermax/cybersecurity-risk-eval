{"cik": "1616543", "company": "Senseonics Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. If any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to our Business and our Industry\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses, including net losses of $29.9 million and $18.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $160.8 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and debt financings. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of our products, including conducting clinical trials.\nTo implement our business strategy we need to, among other things, complete our clinical trials in Europe and the United States, gain regulatory approval in Europe and the United States and other regions where we intend to sell our products, establish additional distribution relationships in Europe to enable our commercial launch, establish our sales and marketing infrastructure to initiate sales of our products in the United States and develop future generations of Eversense. We have never been profitable and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses to increase significantly as we pursue these objectives. The extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain, and we expect to continue incurring significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Any additional operating losses may have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity, and we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain regulatory approvals, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe have no products that are approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to successfully develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize Eversense, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.\nWe have no products that are approved for commercial sale. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the development of Eversense. Our ability to generate revenue from our products will depend heavily on their successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization. The success of any products that we develop will depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of our clinical trials, including our U.S. pivotal trial for Eversense;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of timely marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nour ability to procure and maintain suppliers and manufacturers of the components of Eversense and future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nlaunching commercial sales of Eversense, if approved for marketing;\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance of Eversense, if approved, by people with diabetes, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for Eversense and the related insertion and removal procedures;\n\u00b7\nour success in educating healthcare providers and people with diabetes about the benefits, administration and use of Eversense and future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with Eversense and future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nthe perceived advantages, cost, safety, convenience and accuracy of alternative diabetes management therapies;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for Eversense and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices; and\n\u00b7\nmaintaining a continued acceptable accuracy, safety, duration and convenience profile of Eversense following approval.\nWhether regulatory approval will be granted is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Eversense's success in clinical trials will not guarantee regulatory approval. The FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data, take additional manufacturing steps, or require other conditions before they will grant us approval. If the FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and the EEA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities require additional clinical trials or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, the FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and the EEA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not consider sufficient any additional required clinical trials, data or information that we perform and complete or generate.\nIn cases where we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market one or more of our products, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of people with diabetes we target is not as significant as we estimate or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved.\nApproval or clearance in the United States by the FDA or by a regulatory agency in another country does not guarantee approval by the regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or ensure approval for the same conditions of use. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. It is possible that Eversense will never obtain regulatory approval in Europe or the United States, even if we expend substantial time and resources seeking such approval. If we do not achieve one or more of these approvals in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to fully commercialize Eversense and achieve profitability.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we will have ongoing responsibilities under U.S. and EU regulations. We will also be subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and EEA and comparable foreign authorities to determine compliance with regulatory requirements, such as the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, of the FDA, medical device reporting regulations, vigilance in reporting of adverse events and regulations regarding notification, corrections, and recalls. These inspections can result in observations or reports, warning letters or other similar notices or forms of enforcement action. If the FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and EEA or any comparable foreign authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, such authority could ban these products, suspend or cancel our marketing authorizations, impose \"stop-sale\" and \"stop-import\" orders, refuse to issue export certificates, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, correction or refund of such products, or require us to notify health providers and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Discovery of previously unknown problems with our product's design or manufacture may result in restrictions on the use of Eversense, restrictions placed on us or our suppliers, or withdrawal of an existing regulatory clearance for Eversense. The FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and EEA or comparable foreign authorities may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us, or recommend criminal prosecution of our company. Adverse regulatory action may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more extensive, and we may become subject to even more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company's noncompliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company's business license and civil or criminal sanctions. In some jurisdictions, such as Germany, any violation of a law related to medical devices is also considered to be a violation of unfair competition law. In such cases, governmental authorities, our competitors and business or consumer associations may then file lawsuits to prohibit us from commercializing\nEversense in such jurisdictions. Our competitors may also sue us for damages. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are dependent on one product, Eversense. Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop, commercialize and gain market acceptance for our products.\nOur current business strategy is highly dependent on launching Eversense into commercial markets and achieving and maintaining market acceptance. In order for us to sell Eversense to people with intensively managed diabetes, we must convince them, their caregivers and healthcare providers that Eversense is an attractive alternative to competitive products for the monitoring of glucose levels, including SMBG, as well as other competitive CGM systems and alternatives to CGM methodologies. Market acceptance and adoption of Eversense depends on educating people with diabetes, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, as to the distinct features, ease-of-use, positive lifestyle impact, and other perceived benefits of Eversense as compared to competitive products.\nAchieving and maintaining market acceptance of Eversense could be negatively impacted by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe failure of Eversense to achieve wide acceptance among people with intensively managed diabetes, their caregivers, healthcare providers, third-party payors and key opinion leaders in the diabetes treatment community;\n\u00b7\nlack of evidence supporting the accuracy, duration, safety, ease-of-use or other perceived benefits of Eversense over competitive products or other currently available diabetes management therapies;\n\u00b7\nperceived risks associated with the use of Eversense or similar products or technologies generally;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of competitive products and the rate of acceptance of those products as compared to Eversense;\n\u00b7\nadverse results of clinical trials relating to Eversense or similar competitive products; and\n\u00b7\nloss of regulatory approval for Eversense, adverse publicity or other adverse events including any product liability lawsuits.\nIn addition, Eversense may be perceived by people with intensively managed diabetes, their caregivers or healthcare providers to be more complicated or less effective than traditional monitoring methodologies, including SMBG, and people may be unwilling to change their current regimens.\nMoreover, healthcare providers tend to be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement. Accordingly, healthcare providers may not recommend Eversense unless and until there is sufficient evidence to convince them to alter the treatment methods they typically recommend, such as receiving recommendations from prominent healthcare providers or other key opinion leaders in the diabetes treatment community.\nIf we are not successful in convincing people with diabetes of the benefits of Eversense, or if we are unable to achieve the support of caregivers and healthcare providers or widespread market acceptance for Eversense, then our sales potential, strategic objectives and profitability could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may fail to effectively compete or become profitable.\nIn order to capture and grow market share in the intensively managed diabetes market, we will need to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to the evolving demands of people with intensively managed diabetes and healthcare providers, as well as competitive pressures and technologies. We may not be successful in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, or marketing Eversense or future versions of Eversense. In addition, notwithstanding our market research efforts, our future products may not be accepted by people with diabetes, their caregivers, healthcare providers or third-party payors who reimburse people with diabetes for Eversense and healthcare providers for their\nservices. The success of Eversense or future versions of Eversense will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nidentify the product features that people with intensively managed diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking in a CGM system and successfully incorporate those features into our products;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and introduce future generations of Eversense in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\noffer products at a price that is competitive with other products then available;\n\u00b7\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties;\n\u00b7\ndemonstrate the accuracy and safety of Eversense or future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nobtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for Eversense or future versions of Eversense and the related insertion and removal procedures; and\n\u00b7\nobtain the necessary regulatory approvals for Eversense and future versions of Eversense. For example, a future product enhancement involves on-demand, swipe measurement technology that would permit people with Type 1 diabetes to perform real-time, single glucose readings by swiping their smartphone over our sensor. We do not believe that such technology would require cGMP-compliant manufacturing for smartphones used for these real-time readings. However, if regulatory authorities were to disagree, this would adversely impact our ability to commercialize that product enhancement.\nIf we fail to generate demand by developing products that incorporate features requested by people with diabetes, their caregivers or healthcare providers, or if we do not obtain regulatory clearance or approval for Eversense or future versions of Eversense in time to meet market demand, we may fail to generate sales sufficient to achieve or maintain profitability. We have in the past experienced, and we may in the future experience, delays in various phases of product development and commercial launch, including during research and development, manufacturing, limited release testing, marketing and customer education efforts. Any delays in our anticipated product launches may significantly impede our ability to successfully compete in our markets. In particular, such delays could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products, or to purchase our competitors' products. Even if we are able to successfully develop Eversense or future versions of Eversense when anticipated, these products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by the changing preferences of people with diabetes or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nFailure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for Eversense or future versions of Eversense systems, including the related insertion and removal procedures, by third-party payors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe plan to derive nearly all of our revenue from sales of Eversense, if approved, in Europe and the United States and expect to do so for the next several years. Patients who receive treatment for their medical conditions and their healthcare providers generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their medical treatment, including healthcare providers' services. As a result, access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for Eversense by third-party payors is essential to the acceptance of our products by people with diabetes. Similarly, healthcare providers may choose not to order a product unless third-party payors pay a substantial portion of the product. Coverage determinations and reimbursement levels of both our products and the healthcare provider's performance of the insertion and removal procedures are critical to the commercial success of our product, and if we are not able to secure positive coverage determinations and reimbursement levels for our products or the insertion and removal procedures, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nWithin and outside the United States, reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government sponsored and private health insurance plans. These third-party payors determine whether to provide reimbursement for specific products and procedures. A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for our products does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be obtained. Further, one third-party payor's decision to cover our products does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the products or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In addition, there may be significant delays in obtaining a reimbursement determination, and coverage, if granted, may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is cleared by the FDA, the corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and EEA or other foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover,\neligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers its associated costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. For example, payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or third-party payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices.\nIn the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, does not currently reimburse patients for the cost of a CGM system, like Eversense, although the cost of certain related medical services may be reimbursed. Until such time as adequate coverage is extended by CMS and/or its contractors, reimbursement of our products will generally be limited to customers covered by those private third-party payors that have adopted policies recognizing coverage and reimbursement for CGM devices. Private insurance companies and other private, third-party payors set payor-specific reimbursement policies. The extent of coverage and the rate of reimbursement varies on a payor-by-payor basis. As of December 31, 2015, several of the largest private third-party payors, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of CGM devices. These policies include varied coverage requirements regarding patient condition and characteristics. Many of these coverage policies reimburse for CGM systems under durable medical equipment benefits, which are restrictive in nature and require the healthcare provider or supplier to comply with extensive documentation and other requirements.\nIn the United States, many third-party payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. As described above, CMS does not currently cover CGM devices to patients for their home use. We do not know whether CMS will ever cover Eversense or any other CGM-related products. In addition, those third-party payors that cover CGM products may and have included limitations as to the patient conditions and characteristics eligible for coverage and may adopt different coverage and reimbursement policies for our products, which could also diminish payments for Eversense. It is possible that some third-party payors will not offer any coverage for our products.\nWe plan to seek private-payor reimbursement for Eversense and specific reimbursement code recognition for the insertion and removal procedures with national and regional third-party payors in the United States. While we also anticipate entering into contracts with third-party payors, we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in doing so or that the reimbursement contracts that we are able to negotiate will enable us to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, contracts with third-party payors generally can be modified or terminated by the third-party payor without cause and with little or no notice to us. Moreover, compliance with the administrative procedures or requirements of third-party payors may result in delays in processing approvals by those third-party payors for people with diabetes to obtain coverage for Eversense. Failure to secure or retain adequate coverage or reimbursement for Eversense by third-party payors, or delays in processing approvals by those payors, could result in the loss of sales, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates, among others. As such, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional preauthorization requirements, both in the United States and in international markets. Our dependence on the commercial success of our Eversense products makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. If third-party coverage and reimbursement of products for which we may receive regulatory approval is not available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, or if our production costs increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels, we may be unable to sell Eversense or future versions of Eversense profitably and our business would be adversely impacted.\nIf important assumptions we have made about what people with intensively managed diabetes are seeking in a CGM system are inaccurate, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy was developed based on a number of important assumptions about the diabetes industry in general, and the intensively managed diabetes market in particular, any one or more of which may prove to be\ninaccurate. For example, we believe that the benefits of CGM will continue to drive increased rates of market acceptance for products in this space. However, this trend is uncertain and limited sources exist to obtain reliable market data.\nAnother key element of our business strategy is utilizing market research to understand how people with diabetes are seeking to improve their diabetes therapy management. This strategy underlies our entire product design, marketing and customer support approach and is the basis on which we developed Eversense. However, our market research is based on interviews, focus groups and online surveys involving people with intensively managed diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers that represent only a small percentage of the overall intensively managed diabetes market. As a result, the responses we received may not be reflective of the broader market and may not provide us accurate insight into the desires of people with intensively managed diabetes. In addition, understanding the meaning and significance of the responses received during our market research necessarily requires that analysis be conducted and conclusions be drawn. We may not be able perform an analysis that yields meaningful results, or the conclusions we draw from the analysis could be misleading. Moreover, even if our market research has allowed us to better understand the features people with diabetes are seeking in a CGM system to improve the management of their diabetes, there can be no assurance that people with diabetes will actually purchase our products. As such, our strategy of focusing on the intensively managed diabetes market may limit our ability to increase sales or achieve profitability.\nWe operate in a very competitive industry and if we fail to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, many of whom have greater resources than we have, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nThe market for CGM systems is very competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. We believe competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to manage diabetes. We expect to compete with well-capitalized companies, some of which are publicly-traded, that manufacture CGM systems including Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, Dexcom, Inc., or Dexcom, and Abbott Diabetes Care, a division of Abbott Laboratories, or Abbott. Each of these three companies has received approval from the FDA to market CGM systems. Dexcom's Bluetooth-enabled CGM system is designed to be integrated with smart phones.\nAs the industry evolves, we anticipate encountering increasing competition from companies that integrate CGM with insulin pumps. We are aware of three companies, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc., which have received FDA approval for CGM-integrated insulin pumps. Johnson & Johnson's system integrates Dexcom's CGM sensor technology and smartphone compatibility.\nIn addition to CGM providers, we will also compete with providers of traditional SMBG systems. Four companies currently account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of SMBG systems: Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson; Abbott; and Bayer Diabetes Care, which has agreed to merge with Panasonic Healthcare Holdings. We may also compete with companies, including Roche Diagnostics and Abbott, developing next generation real-time CGM or sensing devices and technologies, as well as several other companies that are evaluating non-invasive CGM products to measure a user's blood glucose level. For example, Abbott is developing its FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System, which has received the CE mark in Europe and eliminates the need for routine fingersticks by reading glucose levels through a transcutaneous sensor that can be worn for up to 14 days. There are also a number of academic and other institutions involved in various phases of our industry's technology development.\nMany of these competitors enjoy several advantages over us, including:\n\u00b7\ngreater financial and human resources for sales and marketing, and product development;\n\u00b7\nestablished relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nestablished reputation and name recognition among healthcare providers and other key opinion leaders in the diabetes industry;\n\u00b7\nin some cases, an established base of long-time customers;\n\u00b7\nproducts supported by long-term clinical data;\n\u00b7\nlarger and more established sales, marketing and distribution networks;\n\u00b7\ngreater ability to cross-sell products or provide incentives to healthcare providers to use their products; and\n\u00b7\nmore experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, and obtaining regulatory approval or clearance.\nIn addition, mergers and acquisitions in the diabetes industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete with our competitors, we may fail to meet our strategic objectives, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nCompetitive products or other technological innovations for the monitoring, treatment or prevention of diabetes may render our products less competitive or obsolete.\nOur ability to achieve our strategic objectives will depend, among other things, on our ability to develop and commercialize products for the monitoring and management of diabetes that offer distinct features, have a longer duration than available alternatives, are easy-to-use, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, include essential safety features and are more appealing than available alternatives. Our primary competitors, as well as a number of other companies, medical researchers and existing medical device companies are pursuing new delivery devices, delivery technologies, sensing technologies, procedures, drugs and other therapies for the monitoring, treatment and prevention of diabetes. For example, the National Institutes of Health and other supporters of diabetes research are continually seeking ways to prevent, cure or improve treatment of diabetes, which if successful could render glucose monitoring devices, like Eversense, obsolete. Any technological breakthroughs in diabetes monitoring, treatment or prevention could reduce the potential market for Eversense or render Eversense less competitive or obsolete altogether, which would significantly reduce our potential sales.\nBecause of the size of the intensively managed diabetes market, we anticipate that companies will continue to dedicate significant resources to developing competitive products. The frequent introduction by competitors of products that are, or claim to be, superior to our products may create market confusion that may make it difficult to differentiate the benefits of our products over competitive products. In addition, the entry of multiple new products may lead some of our competitors to employ pricing strategies that could adversely affect the pricing of our products. If a competitor develops a product that competes with or is perceived to be superior to Eversense, or if a competitor employs strategies that place downward pressure on pricing within our industry, our sales may decline significantly or may not increase in line with our expectations, either of which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe size and future growth in the market for CGM systems and CGM-related products has not been established with precision and may be smaller than we estimate, possibly materially. If our estimates and projections overestimate the size of this market, our sales growth may be adversely affected.\nOur estimates of the size and future growth in the market for CGM systems and CGM-related products, including the number of people currently intensively managing their diabetes who may benefit from and be amenable to using Eversense, is based on a number of internal and third-party studies, reports and estimates. In addition, our internal estimates are based in large part on current treatment patterns by healthcare providers using CGM systems and our belief that the incidence of diabetes in the United States and worldwide is increasing. While we believe these factors have historically provided and may continue to provide us with effective tools in estimating the total market for CGM systems and CGM related products and our products, these estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. The actual incidence of diabetes, and the actual demand for our products or competitive products, could differ materially from our projections if our assumptions are incorrect. As a result, our estimates of the size and future growth in the market for our CGM systems may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of people with diabetes who would benefit from Eversense\nand the size and future growth in the market for Eversense is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our projected sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur distribution agreement with Rubin to market Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark may not be successful.\nAlthough we have entered into a distribution agreement with Rubin to market Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, because we have yet to receive regulatory approval to commercialize Eversense in Europe, Rubin is currently not marketing, selling or distributing Eversense. Under the agreement, following regulatory approval, Rubin will generally be responsible for the promotion, sale and distribution of Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark at such prices as Rubin determines in its sole discretion. The initial prices at which Rubin purchases the products from us are set forth in the agreement. Although Rubin has the exclusive right to distribute Eversense in the covered countries, the agreement does not require Rubin to sell our products exclusively, and therefore, Rubin is free to sell products of our competitors. Because we have not yet received regulatory approval, we are not yet able to assess Rubin's performance in distributing Eversense in the covered countries, and it may take an extended period of time for us to accurately assess their performance under the agreement. Additionally, because the agreement with Rubin is exclusive and has an initial five year term, we will have limited ability to terminate the agreement with Rubin or to contract with any other distributor for Sweden, Norway and Denmark, and therefore we may be entirely dependent on Rubin for sales in these countries. If Rubin fails to perform satisfactorily under the agreement, our ability to commercialize in these countries, and potentially throughout Europe, could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish additional distribution arrangements, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans in Europe and our sales in Europe may be negatively affected.\nTo commercialize Eversense in Europe, we plan to establish arrangements with third-party distributors. Aside from our agreement with Rubin with respect to Sweden, Norway and Denmark, we have not entered into any distribution arrangements to date. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate distribution arrangements. Whether we reach a definitive distribution agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the distributor's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement and the proposed distributor's evaluation of a number of factors. The distributor may also consider alternative CGM systems or technologies that may be available if such an arrangement could be more attractive than the one with us for Eversense. We expect that none of our third-party distributors will be required to sell our products exclusively and each of them may freely sell the products of our competitors.\nDistribution arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate distribution arrangements on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of Eversense, delay its potential commercialization in Europe or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our products or bring them to market and generate revenue.\nIn addition, if a third-party distributor does not effectively sell our products, or if it engages in certain activities or ceases to distribute our products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues or enter into new countries and our sales would be adversely affected. In such a situation, we may need to seek alternative third-party distributors or increase our reliance on our other third-party distributors, which may harm our sales. Additionally, to the extent that we enter into additional arrangements with third-party distributors to perform sales, marketing, or distribution services, the terms of the arrangements could cause our product margins to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products.\nIf we are unable to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not be successful in commercializing Eversense in the United States, even if we receive regulatory approval.\nWe have not yet commercialized Eversense and we do not have experience marketing and selling our products or training healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the use of Eversense. To achieve commercial success in the United States for Eversense, we will need to establish and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure to drive adoption of our products, and we plan to include a team of diabetes educators that will train healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the use of Eversense. There is significant competition for sales personnel experienced in relevant medical device sales. We expect that we will face significant challenges as we recruit and subsequently grow our sales and marketing infrastructure. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient, and skilled, sales and marketing representatives, our sales could be adversely affected. If one of our sales or marketing representatives were to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, they could help competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could further harm our sales. In addition, if our sales and marketing representatives or diabetes educators fail to achieve their objectives or if we are not able to recruit and retain a network of diabetes educators, we may not be able to successfully train healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the use of Eversense, which could delay new sales and harm our reputation.\nAs we increase our sales and marketing expenditures with respect to Eversense or future versions of Eversense, we will need to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales and marketing representatives with significant industry-specific knowledge in various areas, such as diabetes treatment techniques and technologies. Our success will depend largely on the competitive landscape for our products and the ability of our sales personnel to obtain access to healthcare providers and persuade those healthcare providers to recommend Eversense to people who intensively manage their diabetes. Recently hired sales representatives require training and take time to achieve full productivity. We cannot be certain that new hires will become as productive as may be necessary to maintain or increase our sales. In addition, the expansion of our sales and marketing personnel will place significant burdens on our management team.\nWe anticipate that we will derive nearly all of our U.S. revenue from the sales of Eversense or future versions of Eversense and that this will continue for the next several years. As a result, our financial condition and operating results will be highly dependent on the ability of our sales representatives to adequately promote, market and sell Eversense and the ability of our diabetes educators to train healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the use of Eversense. If we are unable to establish and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our existing or planned products, or enhance the strength of our brand, either of which could impair our projected sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our revenue will depend on establishing a customer base and retaining a high percentage of our customer base.\nA key to maintaining and growing our revenue will be establishing a customer base and retaining a high percentage of our customers due to the potentially significant revenue generated from ongoing purchases of disposable sensors. We intend to develop programs to help with retention aimed at customers, their caregivers and healthcare providers, which include training specific to Eversense, ongoing support by sales and clinical employees and 24/7 technical support and customer service. If demand for our products fluctuates as a result of the introduction of competitive products, changes in reimbursement policies, manufacturing problems, perceived safety issues with our or our competitors' products, the failure to secure regulatory clearance or approvals, or for other reasons, our ability to attract and retain customers could be harmed. The failure to retain a high percentage of our customers would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have no operating history as a commercial-stage company and may face difficulties encountered by companies early in their commercialization in competitive and rapidly evolving markets.\nTo date, we have not commercialized any products. If approved, we plan to launch Eversense in Europe in the first half of 2016. Accordingly, we have no operating history as a commercial-stage company upon which to evaluate our business, future sales expectations and operating results. In assessing our business prospects, you should consider the various risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies early in their commercialization in competitive and\nrapidly evolving markets, particularly companies that develop and sell medical devices. These risks include our ability to:\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory clearance or approval to commercialize our products;\n\u00b7\nperform clinical trials with respect to Eversense or future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nimplement and execute our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nexpand and improve the productivity of our sales and marketing infrastructure to grow sales of Eversense or future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nincrease awareness of our brand and Eversense and build loyalty among people with intensively managed diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers;\n\u00b7\nmanage expanding operations;\n\u00b7\nexpand the capabilities and capacities of our third-party manufacturers, including increasing production of current products efficiently and having our vendors adapt their manufacturing facilities to the production of new products;\n\u00b7\nrespond effectively to competitive pressures and developments;\n\u00b7\nenhance Eversense and develop future versions of Eversense; and\n\u00b7\nattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in various areas of our business.\nDue to our lack of operating history as a commercial-stage company, we may not have the institutional knowledge or experience to be able to effectively address these and other risks that may face our business. In addition, we may not be able to develop insights into trends that could emerge and negatively affect our business and may fail to respond effectively to those trends. As a result of these or other risks, we may not be able to execute key components of our business strategy, and our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of Eversense for clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. Risks associated with the manufacturing of our products could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or direct manufacturing personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of Eversense for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if Eversense receives regulatory approval. Therefore, our business strategy depends on our third-party manufacturers' ability to manufacture Eversense in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis so as to meet consumer demand, while adhering to product quality standards, complying with regulatory requirements and managing manufacturing costs. We are subject to numerous risks relating to our reliance on the manufacturing capabilities of our third-party manufacturers, including:\n\u00b7\nquality or reliability defects in Eversense;\n\u00b7\ninability to secure product components in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\nfailure to increase production of Eversense to meet demand;\n\u00b7\ninability to modify production lines to enable us to efficiently produce future products or implement changes in current products in response to regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\ninability to establish agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms; or\n\u00b7\npotential damage to or destruction of our manufacturers' equipment or facilities.\nThese risks are likely to be exacerbated by our limited experience with Eversense and its manufacturing process. As demand for our products increases, our third-party suppliers will need to invest additional resources to purchase components, hire and train employees, and enhance their manufacturing processes. If our manufacturers fail to increase production capacity efficiently, our sales may not increase in line with our expectations and our operating margins could fluctuate or decline. In addition, although we expect some of our future versions of Eversense to share product features and components with our first generation Eversense, manufacturing these future versions of Eversense may require the modification of production lines, the identification of new manufacturers for specific components, or the\ndevelopment of new manufacturing technologies. It may not be possible for us to manufacture these products at a cost or in quantities sufficient to make these future versions of Eversense commercially viable.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the components of Eversense and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of materials, could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to supply and manufacture the components of our Eversense system. For our business strategy to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with components and Eversense systems in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and quality control standards, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Future increases in sales of Eversense, if approved, whether expected or unanticipated, could strain the ability of our suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of components and Eversense systems in a manner that meets these various requirements.\nWe generally use a small number of suppliers of components for our products. Depending on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. Generally, we do not have long-term supply agreements with our suppliers and, in many cases, we make our purchases on a purchase order basis. Under most of our supply and manufacturing agreements, we have no obligation to buy any given quantity of products, and our suppliers have no obligation to sell us or to manufacture for us any given quantity of components or products. As a result, our ability to purchase adequate quantities of components or our products may be limited and we may not be able to convince suppliers to make components and products available to us. Additionally, our suppliers may encounter problems that limit their ability to supply components or manufacture products for us, including financial difficulties, damage to their manufacturing equipment or facilities, or product discontinuations. As a result, there is a risk that certain components could be discontinued and no longer available to us. We may be required to make significant \"last time\" purchases of component inventory that is being discontinued by the supplier to ensure supply continuity. If we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. Because of factors such as the proprietary nature of our products, our quality control standards and regulatory requirements, we may not be able to quickly engage additional or replacement suppliers for some of our critical components. Failure of any of our suppliers to deliver components at the level our business requires could disrupt the manufacturing of our products and limit our ability to meet our sales commitments, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nWe may also have difficulty obtaining similar components from other suppliers that are acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory agencies, and the failure of our suppliers to comply with strictly enforced regulatory requirements could expose us to regulatory action including warning letters, product recalls, and termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. It could also require us to cease using the components, seek alternative components or technologies and modify our products to incorporate alternative components or technologies, which could result in a requirement to seek additional regulatory approvals. Any disruption of this nature or increased expenses could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur third-party suppliers operate primarily at facilities in a single location, and any disruption to these facilities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nEach of our third-party suppliers operates at a facility in a single location and substantially all of our inventory of component supplies and finished goods is held at these locations. We, and our suppliers, take precautions to safeguard facilities, including acquiring insurance, employing back-up generators, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data. However, vandalism, terrorism or a natural or other disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could damage or destroy equipment or our inventory of component supplies or finished products, cause substantial delays in our operations, result in the loss of key information, and cause us to incur additional expenses. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. In addition, regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our or our suppliers' facilities could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nVarious factors outside our direct control may adversely affect manufacturing, sterilization and distribution of our products.\nThe manufacture, sterilization and distribution of our products is challenging. Changes that our suppliers may make outside the purview of our direct control can have an impact on our processes, quality of our products and the successful delivery of products to our customers. Mistakes and mishandling are not uncommon and can affect supply and delivery. Some of these risks include:\n\u00b7\nfailure to complete sterilization on time or in compliance with the required regulatory standards;\n\u00b7\ntransportation and import and export risk, particularly given the international nature of our supply and distribution chains;\n\u00b7\ndelays in analytical results or failure of analytical techniques that we will depend on for quality control and release of products;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, labor disputes, financial distress, raw material availability, issues with facilities and equipment or other forms of disruption to business operations affecting our manufacturers or suppliers; and\n\u00b7\nlatent defects that may become apparent after products have been released and that may result in a recall of such products.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, our ability to provide our products to customers on a timely basis would be adversely impacted.\nPotential complications from Eversense or future versions of Eversense may not be revealed by our clinical experience.\nBased on our experience, complications from use of Eversense may include sensor errors, sensor failures, broken sensors, lodged sensors or skin irritation under the adhesive dressing of the transmitter. Inflammation or redness, swelling, minor infection, and minor bleeding at the sensor insertion site are also possible risks with an individual's use of the device. However, if unanticipated side-effects result from the use of Eversense or future versions of Eversense, we could be subject to liability and our systems would not be widely adopted. Additionally, we have limited clinical experience with repeated use of our CGM system in the same patient or the same insertion site. We cannot assure you that long-term use would not result in unanticipated complications, even after the device is removed.\nUndetected errors or defects in Eversense or future versions of Eversense could harm our reputation, decrease the market acceptance of Eversense or expose us to product liability claims.\nEversense or future versions of Eversense may contain undetected errors or defects. Disruptions or other performance problems with Eversense or future versions of Eversense may harm our reputation. If that occurs, we may incur significant costs, the attention of our key personnel could be diverted or other significant customer relations problems may arise. We may also be subject to warranty and liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in Eversense or future versions of Eversense. A material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of Eversense could harm our business and operating results. This risk exists even if a device is cleared or approved for commercial sale and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products are designed to affect, and any future products will be designed to affect, important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with Eversense or future versions of Eversense systems could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability lawsuits.\nThe sale and use of Eversense or future versions of Eversense could lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that Eversense or one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend, either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition. Product liability claims may be brought against us by people with diabetes, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products, among others. If we\ncannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ncosts of litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management's attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize Eversense or future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for Eversense;\n\u00b7\ndamage to our business reputation;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls or withdrawals from the market;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue.\nWhile we currently maintain product liability insurance covering claims up to $5.0 million per incident and intend to increase our coverage in connection with our commercial launch, we cannot assure you that such insurance would adequately protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing such insurance coverage in the future.\nIf there are significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory management, product development tasks, research and development data, and technical support functions. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power losses, and computer system or data network failures. In addition, our data management application and a variety of our software systems, including the software in our smart transmitter, are hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks, which could be subject to computer viruses or hacker attacks or other failures. If our or our third-party service provider's security systems are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive data. If we or our third-party service providers were to experience a breach compromising sensitive data, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected and the use of our products could decrease.\nThe failure of our or our service providers' information technology systems or our transmitter's software to perform as we anticipate or our failure to effectively implement new information technology systems could disrupt our entire operation or adversely affect our products and could result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, and product shortages, all of which could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third-parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or the generation of significant future revenues.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnerships or other arrangements to develop products and to pursue new markets. Proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure, or complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We have limited institutional knowledge and experience with respect to these business development activities, and we may also not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of products that achieve commercial success or result in significant revenues and could be terminated prior to developing any products.\nAdditionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our future collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any future collaborators, they may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we may have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that any future collaborators devote to our or their future products. Disputes between us and our collaborators may result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and arrangements will be contractual in nature and will generally be terminable under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to have rights to the products relating to such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.\nIf we enter into in-bound intellectual property license agreements, we may not be able to fully protect the licensed intellectual property rights or maintain those licenses. Future licensors could retain the right to prosecute and defend the intellectual property rights licensed to us, in which case we would depend on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for the licensed intellectual property. These licensors may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Further, entering into such license agreements could impose various diligence, commercialization, royalty or other obligations on us. Future licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of complementary products or technologies, and the failure to manage acquisitions, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire other companies, products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base, or advance our business strategies. Potential acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nproblems assimilating the acquired products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nissues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management's attention from our existing business;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u00b7\nincreased legal and accounting costs relating to the acquisitions or compliance with regulatory matters; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated or undisclosed liabilities of any target.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired products or technologies. Our potential inability to integrate any acquired products or technologies effectively may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nWe will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitable operations.\nWe intend to increase our operating expenses substantially in connection with the planned launch of Eversense, establishment of our sales and marketing infrastructure, our ongoing research and development activities, and the commensurate development of our management and administrative functions. We will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitability, and we might not be able to do so. Even if we do generate significant sales, we might not be able\nto achieve, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our sales grow more slowly than we expect, or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise substantial additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, scale back or cease some or all operations. As a result, our registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nAt the time that the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 was completed, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations through December 31, 2016 without additional financing and, therefore, we concluded there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding this uncertainty in its report on those financial statements. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we have insufficient committed sources of additional capital to fund our operations as described in this Annual Report for more than a limited period of time. We have filed a registration statement with the SEC in connection with a proposed public offering of our common stock; however, our ability to complete that offering is subject to prevailing market conditions and other circumstances which are beyond our control. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will be able to complete our proposed public offering on favorable terms or at all. Even if we complete our proposed public offering, we will need to access additional funds before we become financially self-sustaining through cash flow from operations. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with potential borrowings under our Note Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Energy Capital, LLC, or Energy Capital, and our credit facility with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, will be sufficient to fund our operations through early 2016. The continued growth of our business, including the establishment of our sales and marketing infrastructure, and research and development activities will significantly increase our expenses. In addition, the amount of our future product sales is difficult to predict and actual sales may not be in line with our expectations. As a result, we may be required to seek substantial additional funds in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearance or approval for Eversense or future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with developing and commercializing our products;\n\u00b7\nany change in our development priorities regarding our future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nthe revenue generated by sales of Eversense or future versions of Eversense;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nany change in our plans regarding the manner in which we choose to commercialize our products in the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nexpenses we incur in connection with potential litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u00b7\nanticipated or unanticipated capital expenditures; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated general and administrative expenses.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we do not know whether and the extent to which we may be required to raise additional capital. We may in the future seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock, borrowings under credit lines or other sources. If we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnership arrangements or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential future products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital, we may not be able to establish and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, enhance Eversense or future versions of Eversense, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, changes in supplier relationships, or unanticipated changes in customer demand. Moreover, we\nmay be unable to meet our obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement or other agreements, which could result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay all amounts owed thereunder, and we may be forced to liquidate our assets. In such a scenario, the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, which could negatively effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year.\nWe plan to begin commercial sales of Eversense, if approved, in Europe in the first half of 2016. We have no operating history as a commercial-stage company and we anticipate that there will be meaningful variability in our operating results among years and quarters, as well as within each year and quarter. Our operating results, and the variability of these operating results, will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory clearance or approvals affecting our products or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase sales of Eversense and to commercialize and sell our future products, and the number of our products sold in each quarter;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and grow an effective sales and marketing infrastructure and third-party distribution network;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of our products by people with intensively managed diabetes, their caregivers, healthcare providers and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe pricing of our products and competitive products, and the effect of third-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of, and the timing of the payment for, insurance deductibles required to be paid by our customers and potential customers under their existing insurance plans;\n\u00b7\ninterruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u00b7\nseasonality and other factors affecting the timing of purchases of Eversense;\n\u00b7\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical research and trials on our products in development;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of components and CGM systems that meet our requirements; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing of revenue recognition associated with our product sales pursuant to applicable accounting standards.\nAs a result of our lack of operating history as a commercial-stage company, and due to the complexities of the industry and regulatory framework in which we operate, it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for our future products and to forecast our sales with any degree of certainty. For example, many of the products we will seek to develop and introduce in the future will require regulatory approval or clearance and import licenses before we can sell such products and given that the timing of such approvals, clearances or licenses may be uncertain, it will be difficult for us to predict sales projections for these products with any degree of certainty before such approvals, clearances or licenses are obtained. In addition, we will be significantly increasing our operating expenses as we expand our business. Accordingly, we may experience substantial variability in our operating results from year to year and quarter to quarter. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which currently consists of our term loans with Oxford. In addition, although we have a borrowing facility with Energy Capital, LLC, we may be unable to borrow under such agreement or to generate sufficient cash to service any such indebtedness that we do incur.\nIn July and December 2014, we issued secured notes to Oxford in a private placement for gross proceeds of $10.0 million, pursuant to term loans under a Loan and Security Agreement that matures July 1, 2019, or, as amended, the Loan and Security Agreement. We may increase the borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement by an\nadditional $5.0 million if we receive a CE mark by March 31, 2016. Our obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property. Our Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements or enter into various specified transactions, as well as financial reporting requirements. We were in compliance with the affirmative and restrictive covenants as of December 31, 2015. We may also enter into other debt agreements in the future which may contain similar or more restrictive terms.\nIn addition, on December 7, 2015, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Energy Capital pursuant to which Energy Capital may lend an aggregate principal amount of up to $10.0 million, or the Energy Capital note, subject to the conditions specified in the Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Energy Capital note, if we have not received at least $20.0 million from the sale of our capital stock in an offering of our equity securities (excluding any security granted, issued and/or sold by us to any employee or consultant in such capacity) prior to February 29, 2016, or the Triggering Event, then Energy Capital is obligated to disburse funds on or after March 15, 2016, provided however that if the Triggering Event has occurred and we provide documentation to Energy Capital that our available cash is lower than $500,000, then Energy Capital is obligated to disburse funds any time after March 1, 2016. If the Triggering Event has not occurred, under the terms of the Energy Capital note, we will be unable to borrow under the Purchase Agreement. If after the Triggering Event has occurred and if our cash on hand is higher than $500,000, under the terms of the Note, we will be unable to borrow under the Purchase Agreement until March 15, 2016.\nIn the event that the Triggering Event occurs and we are able to incur indebtedness under the terms of the Energy Capital note, we are obligated to repay the aggregate principal and accrued interest thereon if we issue and sell shares of our equity securities in an underwritten public offering with total proceeds to us exceeding $45.0 million (excluding the Energy Capital note) within ten business days after the closing of such public offering. In the event that we are unable to repay such amounts, we will be in default under the terms of the Energy Capital note, which may also trigger an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement.\nOur ability to make scheduled monthly payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Failure to comply with the conditions of the Loan and Security Agreement and/or the Energy Capital note could result in an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of amounts due under the Loan and Security Agreement and/or the Energy Capital note. We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments, and Oxford could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProlonged negative economic conditions could adversely affect us, our customers and third-party suppliers, which could harm our financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general economic and market conditions. Uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively impact our existing and potential customers, adversely affect the financial ability of health insurers to pay claims, adversely impact our expenses and ability to obtain financing of our operations, and cause delays or other problems with key suppliers.\nHealthcare spending in Europe and the United States has been, and is expected to continue to be, under significant pressure and there are many initiatives to reduce healthcare costs. As a result, we believe that some insurers are scrutinizing insurance claims more rigorously and delaying or denying coverage and reimbursement more often.\nBecause the sale of Eversense will generally depend on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement, any delay or decline in coverage and reimbursement will adversely affect our sales.\nRisks Related to Development of our Products\nMedical device development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our products.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of Eversense in Europe and the United States, we must complete the required European and U.S. pivotal clinical trials and demonstrate the accuracy and safety of Eversense. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. For example, in our recently completed European pivotal clinical trial, we had to suspend the trial due to a prior configuration of our sensor failing to reach the targeted duration. Further, the outcomes of our earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, clinical data is often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our products, including:\n\u00b7\nregulators may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts with third parties or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different trial sites;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials of Eversense may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon our development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of people with diabetes required for clinical trials of Eversense may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or people with diabetes may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nour products may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u00b7\nour third-party contractors conducting the clinical trials may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nregulators may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of clinical trials of our products may be greater than we anticipate; and\n\u00b7\nthe supply or quality of our products or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our products may be insufficient or inadequate.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of Eversense beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of Eversense or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for Eversense in Europe, the United States or elsewhere;\n\u00b7\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nhave Eversense removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\n\u00b7\nOur development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring innovative products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nChanges in the configuration of Eversense may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs products are developed through clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and configuration, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. For example, we have already modified the configuration of Eversense several times in an effort to maximize the duration of our sensor, and we may need to make future configuration modifications prior to or after commencing sales. Most recently, in 2014, we suspended our European pivotal trial in order to allow for a configuration change in the way the sensor was being manufactured, which resulted in a delay in our trial and slowed our development efforts. Any changes we make carry the risk that they will not achieve the intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our products to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered device. Such changes may also require additional testing, regulatory notification or regulatory approval. This could delay completion of clinical trials, increase costs, delay approval of our future products and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing our Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, research and development, clinical, financial and business development expertise of Tim Goodnow, our Chief Executive Officer, R. Don Elsey, our Chief Financial Officer, Mukul Jain, our Vice President, Operations, Quality and Regulatory, Mirasol Panlilio, our Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing, and Lynne Kelley, our Chief Medical Officer, as well as the other members of our scientific and clinical teams. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time and will continue to be able to do so. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, as we progress the development of our product pipeline toward scaling up for commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous medical device companies for similar personnel, many of which have greater financial and other resources dedicated to attracting and retaining personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nAlthough it will be subject to restrictions on trading, a portion of the equity of our management team will not contain other contractual transfer restrictions. This liquidity may represent material wealth to such individuals and impact retention and focus of existing key members of management.\nThe implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could cause disruption to our business and operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, or an ERP system. This system will integrate our operations, including supply-chain, order entry, manufacturing, inventory and financial reporting, among others. ERP system implementations are complex projects that require significant investment of capital and human resources, the reengineering of many business processes and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the improvements to our ERP system may result in potentially much higher costs than anticipated and may adversely affect our ability to develop and launch solutions, fulfill contractual obligations, file reports with the SEC in a timely manner or otherwise operate our business and our controls environment. Moreover, despite our security measures, our information technology systems, including the ERP system, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or hackers, power losses and computer system or data network failures, which could result in significant data losses or theft of sensitive or proprietary information. Any of these consequences may harm our business.\nWe expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 39 employees. As our development progresses, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of research, product development, regulatory affairs and, if Eversense receives regulatory approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, manufacturers and distributors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, manufacturers and distributors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture, testing and sale of medical devices. We could become the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition, injury or death to customers. In addition, the misuse of our products or the failure of customers to adhere to operating guidelines could cause significant harm to customers, including death, which could result in product liability claims. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, with or without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies. Even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance policy, these policies typically have substantial deductibles for which we are responsible. Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance coverage would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in an increase of our product liability insurance premiums. Insurance coverage varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain.\nWe rely primarily on patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary technologies. As of December 31, 2015, we held a total of approximately 350 issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our CGM system. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 37 issued United States patents, 202 patents issued in countries outside the United States, and 111 pending patent applications worldwide. Our patents expire between 2015 and 2030, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2035. We are also seeking patent protection for our proprietary technology in Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Israel, Australia and other countries and regions throughout the world. We also have 12 pending U.S. trademark applications and eight pending foreign trademark applications, as well as four foreign trademark registrations.\nWe have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products and processes. Currently, several of our issued U.S. patents as well as various pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relate to the structure and operation of our CGM sensor and CGM systems, which are important to the functionality of our products. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any jurisdiction, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved in a timely manner or at all. The rights granted to us under our patents, and the rights we are seeking to have granted in our pending patent applications, may not provide us with any meaningful commercial advantage. In addition, those rights could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors, or be declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer the same or similar products or technologies. Even if we are successful in receiving patent protection for certain products and processes, our competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes which are comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. Due to differences between foreign and U.S. patent laws, our patented intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Even if patents are granted outside the United States, effective enforcement in those countries may not be available.\nWe rely on our trademarks and trade names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. For example, we have two pending applications in the United States for the \"Eversense\" trademark. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved in a timely manner or at all. Third-parties also may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of\nthe trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote additional resources to marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protectable by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers, employees, temporary employees and consultants regarding our intellectual property and proprietary technology. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of those agreements, we may not have an adequate remedy to compensate us for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in the related or resulting know-how and inventions. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other technologies not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf a competitor infringes upon one of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents, trademarks and other rights may be difficult and time consuming. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid change and constant evolution and, consequently, patent positions in our industry can be uncertain. Even if successful, litigation to defend our patents and trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management's attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources or desire to defend our patents or trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third-parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially material. The occurrence of any of these events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent litigation, and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management's time and efforts, stop our development and commercialization measures, harm our reputation or require us to pay damages.\nOur success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of third-parties. Significant litigation regarding patent rights exists in our industry. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our products. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent issuances, and the complexities of the technology involved increase the risk of patent litigation.\nThe medical device industry in general, and the glucose testing sector of this industry in particular, are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on assertions of patent infringement. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to the technology used in our business, including the design and manufacture of CGM sensors and CGM systems, as well as methods for continuous glucose monitoring. Each of these patents contains multiple claims, any one of which may be independently asserted against us. The owners of these patents may assert that the manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of our CGM sensors or CGM systems infringes one or more claims of their patents. Furthermore, there may be additional patents issued to third parties of which we are presently unaware that may relate to aspects of our technology that such third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications that are currently pending and unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that third parties could assert against us and harm our business.\nIn preparation for commercializing our Eversense products, we are performing an analysis, the purpose of which is to review and assess publicly available information to determine whether third parties hold any valid patent rights that we would, or might be claimed to, infringe by commercializing our products. Although we are not aware of any such patent\nrights, we have not previously performed an exhaustive review of this type, and we cannot be certain that it will not result in our locating patent rights relating to our products of which we were not previously aware.\nIn the future, we could receive communications from various industry participants alleging our infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nstop selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we are allegedly infringing;\n\u00b7\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; or\n\u00b7\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third-parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and if available, may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technology.\nPatent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business, stop our development and commercialization measures and harm our reputation. Further, as the number of participants in the diabetes market increases, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, or our employees, have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including those that are our direct competitors or could potentially be our direct competitors. In some cases, those employees joined our company recently. We may be subject to claims that we, or our employees, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we may in the future be subject to allegations that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we successfully defend against these claims, litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. There can be no assurance that this type of litigation will not occur, and any future litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire additional direct sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize Eversense or future versions of Eversense, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the patent laws of countries other than the United States, which may not offer the same level of patent protection and whose rules could seriously affect how we draft, file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications.\nMany countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \"work\" the invention in that country, or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection which makes it difficult to stop infringement.\nWe cannot be certain that the patent or trademark offices of countries outside the United States will not implement new rules that increase costs for drafting, filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications or that any such new rules will not restrict our ability to file for patent protection. For example, we may\nelect not to seek patent protection in some jurisdictions in order to save costs. We may be forced to abandon specific patents due to a lack of financial resources.\nOur intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential competitive threats or confer meaningful competitive benefits.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain any competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make devices that are the same as or similar to Eversense but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;\n\u00b7\nwe or any collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own and, therefore, we may be unable to enforce them;\n\u00b7\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nThe medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies in the United States and the European Commission and corresponding Notified Body in the European Union and the EEA. The regulations are very complex and are subject to rapid change and varying interpretations. Regulatory restrictions or changes could limit our ability to carry on or expand our operations or result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. These governmental authorities enforce laws and regulations that are meant to assure product safety and effectiveness, including the regulation of, among other things:\n\u00b7\nproduct design and development;\n\u00b7\npre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nproduct safety;\n\u00b7\nestablishment registration and product listing;\n\u00b7\nlabeling and storage;\n\u00b7\nmarketing, manufacturing, sales and distribution;\n\u00b7\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u00b7\nservicing and post-market surveillance;\n\u00b7\nadvertising and promotion; and\n\u00b7\nrecalls and field safety corrective actions.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenues.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as fines, civil penalties, injunctions, warning letters, recalls of products, delays in the introduction of products into the market, refusal of the regulatory agency or other regulators to grant future clearances or approvals, and the suspension or withdrawal of existing approvals by such regulatory agencies. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe FDA regulatory clearance process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals could prevent us from commercializing Eversense and future versions of Eversense.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a significant modification to an existing product in the United States, we must obtain either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or approval of a pre-market approval, or PMA, application from the FDA, unless an exemption from pre-market review applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a device legally on the market, known as a \"predicate\" device, with respect to intended use, technology and accuracy and safety, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the accuracy and safety of the device based on extensive data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all for our products.\nIf the FDA requires us to go through a more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline or to not increase in line with our expectations. In addition, the FDA may determine that future products will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain PMA process.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for their intended users;\n\u00b7\nthe data from our clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval; and\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared or approved products on a timely basis.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some people with diabetes from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived accuracy and safety of our products.\nIf we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with the FDA's good manufacturing practice regulations, this could impair our ability to market our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe and our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA's QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The FDA may impose inspections or audits at any time. If we or our suppliers have significant non-compliance issues or if any corrective action plan that we or our suppliers propose in\nresponse to observed deficiencies is not sufficient, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any of the foregoing actions could impair our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nA recall of our products, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant negative impact on us.\nThe FDA has the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Our third-party suppliers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our third-party distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nFurther, under the FDA's medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or regulatory agency action, which could include inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe will be subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our future global operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future global operations will expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that \"fails to prevent bribery\" by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented \"adequate procedures\" to prevent bribery. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will implement and maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by us, and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, third-party distributors, consultants and agents with the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act and other export control, anticorruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations. We cannot assure you, however, that our policies and procedures will be sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, third-party distributors, consultants and agents have not engaged and will not engage in\nconduct for which we may be held responsible, nor can we assure you that our business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions, the Bribery Act or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are subject to additional federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to our healthcare business; our failure to comply with those laws could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAlthough we will not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from government health insurance programs or other third-party payors for Eversense, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could adversely impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which will apply to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nfederal \"sunshine\" requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or the PPACA, on device manufacturers regarding any \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \"knowing failures\"), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period, and manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data by March 31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;\n\u00b7\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing\nexpenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA; and\n\u00b7\nforeign data privacy regulations, such as the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), and the country-specific regulations that implement Directive 95/46/EC, which impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting, and may be stricter than U.S. laws.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain, many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations, or they vary country by country. We are unable to predict what additional federal, state or foreign legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect such legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal, state or foreign governments may (i) impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on us or (ii) challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any of these challenges could impact our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any federal, state or foreign regulatory review to which we may become subject, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming.\nFor example, to enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has recently increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time and resource consuming and can divert management's attention from our core business. Additionally, if we settle an investigation with law enforcement or other regulatory agencies, we may be forced to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be liable if the FDA or another regulatory agency concludes that we have engaged in the off-label promotion of our products.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of the off-label use of our products. Healthcare providers may use our products, if approved, off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician's choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties. Although we intend to train our marketing and direct sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of their cleared uses and our policy will be to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to the laws of EEA Member States implementing Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. EEA Member State legislation may also restrict or impose limitations on our ability to advertise our products directly to the general public. In addition, voluntary EU and\nnational codes of conduct provide guidelines on the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare providers harming our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOff-label use of our product by patients could lead to product liability claims and regulatory action.\nCurrently marketed CGM systems, are intended as adjunctive to SMBG, which means that the devices (including Eversense, if approved) are not intended to provide definitive data regarding a patient's blood glucose levels for purposes of self-medication with insulin. Rather, patients are instructed to obtain confirmation of blood glucose levels, by means of a real-time test-strip reading using blood obtained by means of a fingerstick, prior to administering insulin. The CGM manufacturer has no control over whether patients adhere to labeling instructions and confirm blood glucose levels prior to administering insulin. If a patient fails to do so and has an adverse reaction to self-medication, the patient might make a claim against the CGM manufacturer. While we do not believe that, as a general matter, such a claim would have merit, the possibility of an adverse result to the manufacturer cannot be dismissed, and in any event the manufacturer could incur significant defense costs. Also, if there should be widespread off-label use of CGMs by patients, and resulting adverse medical events, the FDA or other regulatory bodies might require CGM manufacturers, including us, if we commercialize Eversense, to implement additional measures to reduce off-label use, which could be costly or reduce adoption of CGMs.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of our products.\nRecent political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. The sales of our products depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. Both the federal and state governments in the United States continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. This legislation and regulation may result in decreased reimbursement for medical devices, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for medical devices. This could harm our ability to market our products and generate sales.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for our products would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile the goal of healthcare reform is to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involves increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. For example, the PPACA was enacted in March 2010. The PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services and significantly impacts the medical device industries. Among other things, the PPACA:\n\u00b7\nestablishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;\n\u00b7\nimplements payment system reforms including value-based payment programs, increased funding for comparative effectiveness research, reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination (such as bundled physician and hospital payments); and\n\u00b7\ncreates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nAt this time, we cannot predict which, if any, additional healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they, or the PPACA, may have on our business and operations, and any of these impacts may be adverse on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the healthcare reform laws.\nThe PPACA imposes, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States beginning in 2013. We do not believe that Eversense is currently subject to this tax based on the retail exemption under applicable Treasury Regulations. However, the availability of this exemption is subject to interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and the IRS may disagree with our analysis. In addition, future products that we manufacture, produce or import may be subject to this tax. The financial impact this tax may have on our business is unclear and there can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by it.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop and you may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the offering price, if at all.\nThere currently is no liquid market for our common stock. Until the completion of our proposed public offering, any trading in our common stock is likely to be extremely sporadic. The public offering price for our common stock in our proposed public offering will be determined through negotiations with the underwriters and may not bear any relation to the price at which our common stock has traded prior to the offering, and may not be indicative of the price at which our common stock will trade after the closing of our proposed public offering. Although we intend to apply to list our common stock on the NYSE-MKT in connection with our proposed public offering, an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following the offering. If an active market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at an attractive price or at all.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plan, or otherwise will dilute our existing stockholders.\nSubject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plan or otherwise, including in our proposed public offering. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 9,251,164 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $0.74 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,010,604 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.79 per share. To the extent these outstanding options or warrants are exercised, there will be further dilution to investors.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford, we are precluded from paying any cash dividends. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell shares and you may lose the entire amount of the investment.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as they will be in effect following our proposed public offering that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change of control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors will have the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents will also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u00b7\nonly one of our three classes of directors will be elected each year;\n\u00b7\nstockholders will not be entitled to remove directors other than by a 662/3% vote and only for cause;\n\u00b7\nstockholders will not be permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u00b7\nstockholders will not be permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nstockholders will be required to give advance notice of their intention to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nWe may be unable to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income taxes as a result of our proposed public offering.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $103.0 million, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire at various dates starting in 2018. These NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" which generally occurs if the percentage of the corporation's stock owned by 5% stockholders increases by more than 50% over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not determined if we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes in the past and if a portion of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including our proposed public offering, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical NOL and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nOur management team may invest or spend the proceeds of our proposed public offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\nOur management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds that we receive from our proposed public offering. We expect to use the net proceeds from our proposed public offering primarily to complete our U.S. pivotal clinical trial and to seek regulatory approval of Eversense in the United States, to fund continued research and development of future configurations of Eversense and to begin developing a direct sales force to market Eversense in the United States. We intend to use the remaining proceeds for working capital and general corporate\npurposes. However, we do not have any specific uses of the net proceeds planned. These net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not favorably affect our financial condition or result of operations. In addition, until we use the net proceeds, they may be placed in investments that do not produce income or that lose value. Our failure to apply the net proceeds from our proposed public offering effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our net proceeds from our proposed public offering.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company in the United States, we expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other costs, which we anticipate could be between $1.0 million and $2.0 million annually. These additional costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and the NYSE-MKT, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.\nFailure to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls could result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent fraud in which case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock.\nWe currently voluntarily file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Upon completion of our proposed public offering, we will register our common stock under the Exchange Act, at which time we will become subject to additional provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Following our proposed public offering, we will also be subject to the rules and regulations of the NYSE-MKT. Even though we are voluntary filers under the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we certify to the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Commencing with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. Prior to the Acquisition, we have never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period, and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner. In addition, we may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nPrior to the Acquisition, our subsidiary, Senseonics, Incorporated, was a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address internal controls and procedures. In connection with Senseonics, Incorporated's 2013 audit, management identified a material weakness whereby Senseonics, Incorporated did not have a control designed and in place to identify and properly account for complex equity transactions. This\nresulted in a material balance sheet reclassification adjustment and the restatement of financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012. We remediated this material weakness primarily by implementing a new control over the process and engaging external accounting experts with the appropriate knowledge to supplement internal resources in the computation and review processes. While this material weakness was remediated, we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future. If we identify such issues or if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the applicable listing requirements.\nEven if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or help prevent fraud. Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from filing our periodic reports on a timely basis which could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nThe shares to be sold in our proposed public offering will be freely tradable without restriction by stockholders who are not our affiliates. In addition, 18,000,108 additional shares, representing 23.8% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, consisting of shares held by legacy ASN Technologies stockholders, including Energy Capital LLC, SBLE, LLC and Kato Consulting, LLC, are not subject to lock-up agreements and are freely tradable without restriction. Of our outstanding shares, 20,000 shares that were outstanding before the Acquisition are \"restricted securities\" as defined in Rule 144. We issued an aggregate of 57,739,953 shares of our common stock to the former Senseonics, Incorporated stockholders pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and such shares are also \"restricted securities\" as defined in Rule 144. These restricted securities may be publicly resold under Rule 144 beginning on December 10, 2016.\nIn addition, in the future, we intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 registering the issuance of approximately 27 million shares of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued, reserved for issuance, and to be reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, including an additional 8,000,000 shares of common stock to be reserved for issuance pursuant to our amended and restated 2015 equity incentive plan effective upon the pricing of our proposed public offering and 800,000 shares of common stock to be reserved for future issuance under our 2016 employee stock purchase plan effective upon the pricing of our proposed public offering. Shares registered under these registration statements on Form S-8 will be available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options and the restrictions of Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates.\nAdditionally, the holders of an aggregate of up to 55,300,420 shares of our common stock, or their transferees, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to\nregister the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities or industry analysts. Securities or industry analysts may elect not to provide coverage of our common stock after the completion of our proposed public offering, and such lack of coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have securities or industry analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more securities or industry analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur common stock is currently considered to be a \"penny stock\" and, if it is considered to be penny stock after the offering, broker/dealers may not want to make a market in our shares which could affect your ability to sell your shares in the future.\nOur common stock is currently considered a \"penny stock\" under rules of the SEC. Although our common stock would cease to be considered penny stock if our shares are listed on the NYSE-MKT following the completion of our proposed public offering, if we were unable to achieve or maintain the listing of our shares on the NYSE-MKT, our common stock may once again be considered penny stock.\nThe SEC's penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouses). As a result, many broker/dealers may not want to make a market in such shares or conduct any transactions in such shares. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules that relate to the application of the SEC's penny stock rules that require a broker/dealer have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment in a penny stock is suitable for that customer, prior to recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative, low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker/dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.\nAt any time that our common stock is considered to be penny stock under SEC rules, these SEC and FINRA rules would make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock if it constitutes penny stock, thereby reducing a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as we expect it to be in effect upon the closing of our proposed public offering, will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Acquisition by ASN Technologies, Inc.\nWe may be subject to unknown risks as a result of our recently completed acquisition by ASN Technologies.\nPrior to the Acquisition, ASN Technologies, which was renamed Senseonics Holdings, Inc., conducted a business related to the design and development of a location-based mobile application to allow users to share information about nearby social and other events. In connection with the Acquisition, we sold this business, including the associated assets and liabilities of the business, to the founder of ASN Technologies. Even though we and our advisers conducted a due diligence investigation of ASN Technologies prior to committing to the Acquisition, there may be unknown liabilities, or liabilities that were known but believed to be immaterial, related to the business of ASN Technologies that may become material liabilities we are subject to in the future. If we are subject to material liability as a result of the conduct of ASN Technologies, we may have limited recourse for such liabilities, which could have a material impact on our business and stock price.", "PERMNO": 15995, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SENS"}
