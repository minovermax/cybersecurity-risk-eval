RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common shares involves various risks and uncertainties. The risks described in this section are among those of which we are currently aware that, as of the filing date of this Report, could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and value of our common shares. The risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate its spread and economic impact, or other outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, could adversely impact or cause disruption of our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental and public health authorities to mitigate its spread, such as instituting quarantines, limiting business operations and travel, restricting group meetings and \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, have led to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets, increases in unemployment and reductions in consumer and business spending.\nWe believe that our ability to operate and our level of business activity has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and could in the future be impacted by another pandemic, and that such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations related to COVID-19, or potentially another pandemic, include the following:\n\u25cf the availability of permanent loans, tax credit equity and other monetization events that are the primary sources of repayment of loans made by the Solar Ventures may be limited, which could lead to fair value losses on loans made by the Solar Ventures and we may lose some or all of our investment;\n\u25cf the value of renewable energy infrastructure projects that secure loans made by the Solar Ventures could decline, which would negatively impact the value of loans made by the Solar Ventures, potentially permanently and materially;\n\u25cf the disruption in the credit markets could cause a lack of opportunity for future loans through a reduced pipeline of loans for investment by the Solar Ventures as well as a reduced availability of other infrastructure investments. Additionally, if the Company is unable to fund its share of capital contributions to the Solar Ventures as a result of an inability to access the debt and equity capital markets, or our capital partner becomes unwilling or unable to continue to contribute its share of capital to the Solar Ventures, the Solar Ventures could default on their lending commitments to their borrowers. This would adversely affect our business, cash flows and financial condition and result in damage to our and our External Manager\u2019s reputation;\n\u25cf construction or development of renewable energy or other infrastructure projects that are being or could be financed through loans made by the Company or Solar Ventures may be unable to proceed on a timely basis or at all due to, among other things, government mandated restrictions or moratoriums on construction or the inability to source the necessary construction personnel, equipment or parts;\n\u25cf significant uncertainty and volatility with respect to the current and future values of real estate-related assets as COVID-19 is expected to continue to have a significant impact on local, national and global economies and has resulted in a world-wide economic slowdown. The impact of COVID-19 on our investments is uncertain; however, it is expected to have a negative impact on the overall real estate market. In addition, lower transaction\nvolume may result in less data for assessing real estate values. This increases the risk that our asset values may not reflect the actual realizable value of our underlying properties at any given time, as valuations and appraisals of our properties and real estate-related assets are only estimates of market value as of the end of the period and may not reflect the changes in values resulting from COVID-19. In addition, many of the COVID-19 impacts that initially occurred continue to exist and are not immediately quantifiable. However, the impact on value will likely become more apparent over the longer term. To the extent real estate or other asset values decline after the date we disclose our asset values, whether related to COVID-19 or otherwise, new investors may overpay for their investment in our common stock, which would heighten their risk of loss;\n\u25cf restrictions on business operations and re-openings or an economic downturn is likely to negatively impact the development and leasing activity related to our equity investment in the SF Venture. Moreover, revenues generated by tenants of the SF Venture may be reduced or the SF Venture may have to grant concessions to tenants both of which could cause losses related to our equity investment in the SF Venture. These factors, among others, led to the impairment of our investment in the SF Venture during 2020;\n\u25cf should economic conditions further deteriorate and cause declines in the value of our investments that would be assessed to be other-than-temporary in nature, we would recognize additional impairment losses related to such investments;\n\u25cf personnel of our External Manager, including our executive officers and other employees of the External Manager that support our operations may become ill and unavailable; and\n\u25cf third-party vendors we rely on to conduct our business, including vendors that provide IT services, legal and accounting services, or other operational support services may become unable to deliver services or support to the Company.\nThe rapid development, fluidity of the circumstances and unknown long-term impacts resulting from COVID-19 preclude any prediction as to the duration and extent of its adverse impact and makes it more difficult to determine the fair value of investments, especially those that rely on estimates and are inherently judgmental. Accordingly, COVID-19 and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risk factors below, including, but not limited to, those relating to our revolving credit facility and our access to capital generally, our exposure to changes in interest rates, our exposure to collateral calls associated with agreements we used to hedge interest rate risk, our investments in bonds and real estate and the lack of liquidity related to the value and marketability of our non-cash assets.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with our renewable energy investments.\nOur renewable energy investments consist primarily of indirect investments in loans made by the Solar Ventures that finance renewable energy projects. The Solar Ventures generally invest in loans that have a duration of less than one year and need to reinvest their redemption proceeds in new investments with comparable returns in order to maintain their existing revenues. In most cases, the repayment of the Solar Venture loans, or their \u201ctake-out,\u201d is dependent upon the refinancing of a given loan or the sale of an underlying renewable energy project to third parties, both of which typically require some combination of tax credit equity, sponsor equity and construction or permanent debt financing. The Solar Ventures may themselves participate in the take-out of such loans by providing long-term financing, including making loans that are subordinate to other loans secured by the renewable energy projects in which we have invested. Additionally, the Solar Ventures may increase the size of funding commitments or extend the contractual maturity of loan receivables or offer other credit enhancements as necessary to preserve the value of loan investments, although such actions, if taken, could potentially result in loss recognition by the Solar Ventures. Furthermore, lenders of permanent loans and syndicators of tax credit equity may require access to the credit markets, which could impact their ability to finance the take-out of the Solar Ventures\u2019 loans.\nThe production of renewable energy depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions. If weather conditions are\nunexpectedly unfavorable, the electricity production from the renewable energy projects that we finance may be substantially below expectations. Should unfavorable weather conditions be sustained or particularly severe, the operating projects in which we have invested may not be able to meet their power production obligations and the projects may have to make payments or buy power to make up for the shortfall. These conditions may also cause demand for power to increase. A decrease in supply or an increase in demand for power or both, could cause a significant increase in the price of power, which may cause our operating projects to have merchant exposure to variable market prices, and that exposure could be substantial. Such exposure, and the failure to meet power production requirements could cause a significant deterioration of the underlying project value and our permanent loan investments. For example, a severe winter storm during the second and third weeks of February 2021 caused ERCOT Project 1 to be unable to meet its energy delivery requirements to its counterparty pursuant to various energy supply and pricing agreements. As a result, ERCOT Project 1 became obligated to purchase, at the maximum market price that was in effect during that time, an amount of power equal to the shortfall in the electricity volumes that it was contractually obligated to deliver. As a result, the Company and our capital partner expect that they will provide the capital to SPL to enable the project to satisfy its net settlement payment obligation of $22.5 million as well as any additional payment obligations, that may be required in connection with or to facilitate the final closing of the recapitalization of the ERCOT Project 1 in the fourth quarter of 2020 upon substantial completion of the project. Due to the project\u2019s value, its capital structure and other repayment risk factors, we believe that recovery of these additional advances expected to be made by SPL would be at significant risk and, consequently, a related fair value loss is expected to be recognized by SPL in the first quarter of 2021 that, taken together with interest income that is not expected to be accrued during such reporting period (as further discussed below), could result in a substantial decrease in SPL\u2019s net income.\nThe Solar Ventures regularly have unfunded loan commitments to borrowers and, as of December 31, 2020, these unfunded loan commitments totaled $261.7 million. The unfunded loan commitments are anticipated to be funded primarily by capital within the Solar Ventures through a combination of uninvested capital and existing loan redemptions. In addition, SCL, SPL and SDL have provided, and may in the future provide, certain guarantees (which may be joint and several) of indemnity and performance obligations associated with the solar projects financed by the Solar Ventures. These guarantees have in the past and may in the future cover such costs as hail damage in excess of insurance coverage, renewable energy credit recapture loss or inability of a tax credit investor to claim investment tax credits due to breaches of the project sponsor\u2019s representations, warranties or covenants. If the Solar Ventures are required to perform on these guarantees, they may not have sufficient cash to meet their other funding obligations. To the extent capital within the Solar Ventures is not sufficient to meet their funding obligations additional capital contributions by the members of the Solar Ventures would be required. The ability of the Company to fund its share of additional capital is currently, and may become increasingly, dependent upon our access to the debt and equity capital markets and the willingness and ability of our capital partner to continue to contribute its share of additional capital or capital in excess of its pro rata ownership of the Solar Ventures. If we are unable to meet our funding obligations, the Solar Ventures could default on their lending commitments to their borrowers, which would adversely affect our business, cash flows and financial condition and result in damage to our and our External Manager\u2019s reputation.\nOur renewable energy investments are subject to various other risks that could adversely impact the demand or financial performance of these investments. We have project related risk including construction risk, permanent financing risk, repayment risk, collateral risks (such as value and ability to foreclose), project operations risk, concentration risk and meteorological risk.\n\u25cf Our concentration risk at any point in time may relate to: (i) developer partners and sponsors; (ii) constructors and Engineering Procurement Construction (\u201cEPC\u201d) contractors; (iii) program and regulatory regimes; (iv) offtake counterparties such as commercial entities and municipalities; (v) take-out counterparties such as tax-equity providers, permanent debt providers and third-party project asset buyers; (vi) single projects size; and (vii) module and equipment suppliers.\n\u25cf To the extent we make longer duration loans that finance projects which have commenced operation, the value of the project and our investment could be adversely affected by whether the project is operated so as to meet its power output requirements, whether the project is properly maintained, whether there is sufficient demand for the power that is produced and whether the project owner must purchase power on the open market to meet shortfalls.\n\u25cf Our project related meteorological risk at any point in time may relate to: natural disasters or unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions that could impair the effectiveness of the renewable energy projects, reduce their\noutput beneath their rated capacity, require shutdown of key equipment or impede operation of the renewable energy projects; or components of renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and inverters, could be damaged by natural disaster or severe weather, including wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, ice storms or tornadoes.\nWe also have market risk, including the following: (i) increased competition in renewable energy lending; (ii) if the cost of energy generated by other than renewable energy sources declines, the demand for projects that the Solar Ventures finance may consequently be reduced, which could harm new business opportunities; (iii) changes in various policies and regulations related to the functioning of the electricity market may adversely impact the use of renewable energy or encourage the use of fossil fuel energy over renewable energy; (iv) renewable energy projects generally rely on supply chains for equipment and transmission from third parties to distribute their output, which may make them susceptible to increased costs or access barriers; (v) development of new electric generating technologies that may be beyond the External Manager\u2019s expertise; (vi) significant reliance on existing relationships to generate investment opportunities; and (vii) disruptions in the credit markets. In considering these market risks, it is important to understand that certain components of the national and some local renewable energy finance markets, such as ERCOT, have been and may further be affected by changing market dynamics, resulting in supply and demand imbalances, particularly for tax equity investments. These market dynamics may materially and negatively impact the Solar Ventures\u2019 loan portfolio in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the availability and pricing of tax equity and the deterioration of underlying project value if the price of electricity falls due to competition or waning demand and a project has merchant exposure. The Solar Ventures\u2019 concentration in some of the affected markets could further impact when and how capital invested in late-stage development, construction and permanent loans is repaid and re-invested. At December 31, 2020, 55.9% of the total UPB of outstanding loans of the Solar Ventures were associated with a single sponsor and were secured by three projects located in the ERCOT service area. As of March 24, 2021, 61.9% of the Company\u2019s total investment in the Solar Ventures represented our allocable share of the total UPB of the Solar Ventures\u2019 outstanding loans to this single sponsor that financed these three projects located in ERCOT.\nFurther, federal and state governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. These incentives include tax credits, tax abatements and rebates among others. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar and other renewable energy. Changes in government incentives, whether at the federal or local level, or changes in federal law, such as tariffs on solar panels or change in policies or regulations related to the functioning of the electric markets could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for renewable energy, which could adversely affect our renewable energy finance business.\nMoreover, we do not control the Solar Ventures. In this regard, our capital partner may not consent to decisions that may be in our best interest or they may at any time have economic or other business interests different than ours. Additionally, as a consequence of various non-pro rata capital contributions made by our capital partner, we held a minority economic interest in SCL, SPL and SDL at December 31, 2020. In this regard, the Company ceded decision-making control over the workout of troubled loans, to the extent there are any, to its capital partner until such time that the amount of equity invested by the Company and its capital partner have come back into equal balance.\nIf we are unable to access the debt or equity capital markets in order to satisfy financial obligations to our capital partner under various non-pro rata funding agreements, our capital partner may have the right to either (i) cause the Solar Ventures to make special distributions disproportionately to it (without distribution to us) of net cash flow from any capital transactions (subject to limitations provided in such non-pro rata funding agreements) or (ii) enter into a mutually agreeable definitive amendment (to be negotiated in good faith) to the relevant operating agreements of the Solar Ventures reflecting the majority funding position of the Company\u2019s capital partner. In the absence of our non-pro rata funding agreements, our capital partner could cause the Company to be assessed as a defaulting member under the Solar Ventures operating agreements and could subject us to a defaulting member loan that accrues interest at a rate of 18% until paid with repayment being made from distributions senior to other distributions that would otherwise be payable to us.\nLastly, the sale or transfer of our interests in the Solar Ventures is also restricted and subject to buy-sell provisions that could be triggered at a time when we may not desire, thus inhibiting our ability to sell our interests or realize the expected returns that may be generated by the Solar Ventures.\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive market.\nWe compete against a number of parties who may provide financing alternatives to the investments in which we invest, including specialty finance companies, banks, private equity, institutional investors, independent power producers, pension funds, developers and others who provide capital solutions to renewable energy developers, EPC contractors and system owners. The continued low interest rate environment and increasing investor appetite in the renewable energy market have increased the level of competition that we face.\nMany of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources than we do, have a lower cost of borrowing or more favorable access to credit, and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we are able to. We may lose business opportunities if we do not match our competitor\u2019s pricing, terms and structure.\nWe face risks associated with the revolving credit facility.\nOur ability to borrow from the revolving credit facility is dependent upon our remaining in compliance with a borrowing base, which is comprised of eligible renewable energy loans made either through the Solar Ventures in which we are an investor or that we have invested in directly. Compliance with the borrowing base depends on a sufficient percentage of the underlying loans remaining performing and eligible. A loan having an event of default or not adhering to pre-set underwriting criteria would cause a loan not to be borrowing base eligible. If the amount drawn from the revolving credit facility exceeds the available capacity under the borrowing base and this variance is not cured in a timely manner, the lender could declare an event of default that could have a variety of negative outcomes that include, but are not limited to, the lender foreclosing on our equity interests in MEH, which holds our interests in the Solar Ventures, all of which have been pledged to secure this financing.\nThe revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants and collateral performance thresholds. An adverse change in the Company\u2019s financial position could cause a financial covenant breach and lead to an event of default. An adverse change in the composition of the underlying loans, an increase in loan tenors or repeated loans extensions, an increase in defaults, principal loss, and or a material reduction in the interest rates being charged could cause us to breach a collateral performance or financial covenant test and lead to an event of default on the revolving credit facility.\nWe may have an UPB associated with amounts drawn from the revolving credit facility when it matures in 2022. If we are unable to repay or refinance the remaining balance of this debt, or if the terms of any available refinancing are not favorable, we may be forced to liquidate assets or incur higher costs which may significantly harm our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our shareholder value over the long term would be adversely affected if we are unable to make new investments, our lenders fail to meet their funding commitments to us or if we are unable to raise capital.\nWe need to identify, attract and obtain new capital in order to increase the number and size of the investments that we make. Our ability to raise capital depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are outside our control. There can be no assurances that we can find or secure commitments for new capital or that new or existing lenders will meet their funding commitments to us. The failure to obtain or maintain capital in sufficient amounts, or to realize sufficient returns on the Company\u2019s current investments, as well as the failure to reinvest investment or capital proceeds into new higher yielding investments could result in a decrease in the number and dollar value of our investments, or a decline in the rate of growth of these investments, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, cash flows and financial condition. If we are unable to raise capital, we may not be able to take full advantage of our External Manager\u2019s pipeline opportunities.\nAdditionally, there is a risk that we will not be able to deploy our cash or the cash held by the Solar Ventures or expand our leverage to make investments that generate risk-adjusted returns that grow shareholder value. Furthermore, because there are no restrictions as to the nature of our investments, our investments in the future may result in additional or new risks that we do not face today.\nReal estate-related investments and bond investments are exposed to various risks associated with real estate.\nBecause all of our real estate-related investments and bond investments are secured by real estate, consist of real estate or investments in entities that own real estate, or are dependent upon incremental tax revenues generated from real estate, the value of these investments is exposed to various real estate-related risks. The value of these investments may be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions or other developments in real estate markets. These factors include but are not limited to: (i) overall development risk; (ii) changes in interest rates that affect the value of the real estate we own or in which we have an interest; and (iii) increasing levels of unemployment and other, adverse regional or national economic conditions. Should any of these investments decline in value, the Company would be required to recognize an impairment loss to the extent that such declines are assessed to be other-than-temporary.\nReal estate may also decline in value because of adverse changes in market conditions, environmental problems, casualty losses for which insurance proceeds are not sufficient to cover the loss, or condemnation proceedings. The value of our real estate-related investments and our ability to conduct business also may be adversely affected by changes in local or national laws or regulatory conditions that affect significant segments of the real estate market. In such circumstances, cash flows from properties or developments that support our bond investments may not be sufficient to pay interest on our bonds, which would cause the value of our investments to decline.\nLIBOR may not be available after 2021, which creates uncertainty around the future value of, and costs associated with, our interest rate derivative instruments and debt obligations that are indexed to LIBOR.\nThe payment terms of our subordinated debt, revolving credit facility and certain interest rate derivative instruments that we use to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk are indexed to LIBOR. It is widely expected that LIBOR will not be quoted or available after 2021. In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority confirmed that one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be published after 2021, as well as confirmed that overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be published after June 2023. We have exposure to one-month and three-month LIBOR.\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee has designated the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a recommended alternative rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR. SOFR is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury Securities. However, there are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR and there can be no assurance that the alternative rate or index will be uniformly adopted or that we and our counterparty to our debt and interest rate derivative contracts will agree on a new rate. In any event, it is unlikely that the new rate will be exactly equal to what LIBOR would have been, so the amount of our borrowing costs may increase or the amount paid to us under our interest rate cap and swap agreements might be less than it would have been had LIBOR continued.\nOur subordinated debt documents contain alternative reference bank quotation mechanisms in the event LIBOR is discontinued, but there can be no assurance that banks will quote an alternate rate. If they do not, and we do not otherwise reach agreement with the servicers or the lenders of these obligations, the debt will convert to a fixed rate equal to the last quoted LIBOR plus our existing spread, which could have a material impact on us should LIBOR experience yield volatility or disruption before it is last quoted.\nOur revolving credit facility agreement contains fallback language in the event LIBOR is discontinued, whereby the administrative agent determines the replacement index in its reasonable judgment, including any adjustment to the replacement rate to reflect a different credit spread.\nAccordingly, it is impossible at this time to predict what our interest cost for our LIBOR indexed debt or the benefits of our LIBOR-based derivatives will be after 2021. The cost could be greater than it would have been had LIBOR continued and the difference could be material to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the fair value of our assets and increase our costs of borrowing.\nOur investments in debt securities and derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value, the measurement of which is based upon estimated market yields that consider credit spreads for comparable investments. Consequently, changes in\ninterest rates and credit spreads could cause the fair value of these instruments to change and, therefore, lead to volatility in our reported financial condition and results.\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Interest rates can also fluctuate as a result of geopolitical events or changes in general economic conditions, including events or conditions that alter investor demand for Treasury or other fixed-income securities.\nChanges in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and/or default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class, may cause fluctuations in credit spreads.\nIf interest rates increase or credit spreads widen, the fair value of our investments in bonds and other fixed rate financial instruments (whose fair value measurements are based upon contractual cash flows) will generally decline and, therefore, have a negative effect on our financial results and our shareholders\u2019 equity. Declines in the fair value of these instruments could be significant in these circumstances.\nIf short-term interest rates rise, our borrowing costs would increase and our net income would decline as interest payments associated with a significant portion of our debt obligations are indexed to short-term interest rates and, therefore, would increase. However, the Company may, from time to time, enter into agreements with third parties that are designed to manage a portion of this risk.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with agreements that we use to manage interest rate risk.\nFrom time to time, we may execute agreements that are designed to reduce our interest rate risk. For example, we may enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and the counterparty agrees to pay us a floating rate of interest in order to synthetically fix our variable rate debt to better match assets that pay on a fixed rate basis. We also may enter into interest rate caps whereby we pay the counterparty an upfront premium and the counterparty pays us if the benchmark rate on the cap reaches a certain level. As further discussed above, derivative instruments are exposed to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates. Additionally, interest rate swaps and caps expose the Company to the risk of counterparty default (including counterparty failure to meet its payment obligations). Further, there is a risk that these contracts do not perform as expected and may cost more than the benefits we receive. Moreover, in the case of interest rate swaps, we are exposed to the risk of collateral calls if the fair value of these instruments declines.\nVirtually all of our non-cash assets are illiquid and may be difficult to sell at their reported carrying values.\nOur renewable energy investments, bonds and other real estate-related investments are illiquid and difficult to value. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility in volatile market conditions as validating pricing for illiquid assets is more subjective than more liquid assets. To the extent that we utilize leverage to finance our investments that are illiquid, the negative impact on us related to trying to sell assets in a short period of time for cash could be greatly exacerbated. If we need to liquidate all or a portion of our investments the price that we are able to realize may be significantly less than their carrying value in our financial statements, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legislation, Regulations and Compliance\nWe could lose the tax benefit of our NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an estimated $358.9 million of federal NOLs that were subject to a partial valuation allowance. Our federal NOLs can be used to offset federal taxable income through 2035 at which time most of our NOLs will have expired if not used. However, there are events that could limit, or cause us to lose, the amount of NOLs available to us before that time. For example, our NOLs could be significantly limited in the event of a change of control event, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. A change of control event may occur when a shareholder, or a collection of shareholders, owning at least five percent of our shares, acquire more than 50% of our outstanding shares within a three-year period. The Company adopted a Tax Benefits Rights Agreement on May 5, 2015 (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) as a measure to avoid a change of control event, although the Company cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the Rights Plan. Changes in tax laws could also cause us to lose, or could otherwise limit, the amount of NOLs available to us. On March 11, 2020,\nthe Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) approved an extension of the original five-year term of the Rights Plan until May 5, 2023, or until the Board determines the plan is no longer required, whichever comes first. The shareholders ratified the Board\u2019s decision to extend the Rights Plan at the Company\u2019s 2020 annual meeting of shareholders.\nMost of our NOLs are also subject to a 20-year carryforward limitation, which limits the time available to generate the income necessary to fully utilize our NOLs. In this regard, it is possible that some of our NOLs will not be utilized if the Company is unable to generate a sufficient amount of pretax book income before their expiration period begins in 2028. In this regard, should the Company assess that it is not more likely than not that it will utilize federal NOLs for which DTAs were recognized in its Consolidated Balance Sheets, an allowance would be established against the DTAs and a loss would be recognized in the reporting period in which the provision was made.\nOur accounting policies and methods require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. We are often required to apply accounting principles to complex transactions or fact patterns and apply judgment when interpreting such rules. In other cases, the application of these policies and methods involve the use of financial models to measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities or produce other estimates that are reflected in our financial statements. Projections that are produced by such models are often based on assumptions and estimates that involve significant judgment and are inherently uncertain. In this regard, we have established procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. However, due to uncertainty surrounding management\u2019s judgments, assumptions and estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements.\nSee Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies and estimates.\nComprehensive tax reform and other legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 provides, among other things, for a reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, which could adversely affect the market for tax credit investors to invest in solar tax credits that support our renewable energy investments. In addition, the government could make further changes in tax or other laws, such as the elimination of renewable energy tax credit incentive programs that while not directly affecting our portfolio, could make renewable energy investments less valuable to investors. For example, if tariffs on solar panels or other renewable energy components were increased, or if federal or state incentives were reduced or eliminated, our renewable energy business could be adversely affected. Congress could also pass laws or make changes in tax rates that make competing investments more attractive than our solar projects, which could also make our investments less valuable.\nIf we become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we could be required to sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result.\nWe continuously monitor our business activities to ensure that we do not become subject to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We currently rely on exemptions from the Investment Company Act for companies that are engaged primarily in the business of certain types of financing, including sales financing, based on our primary investments in loans related to the purchase and installation of renewable energy infrastructure. If we were to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, either due to a change in the SEC\u2019s interpretation of that Act or due to a significant change in the value and composition of our assets, we would be subject to extensive regulation and restrictions. Among other restrictions, we would not be able to incur borrowings, which would limit our ability to fund certain investments. Accordingly, either we would have to restructure our assets so that we would not be subject to the Investment Company Act or we would have to materially change the way we do business. Either course of action could require that we sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Our Relationship with Our External Manager\nWe no longer have any employees and we are therefore dependent upon the External Manager to provide all of the services we need, including finding and underwriting suitable investments, conducting our operations and maintaining regulatory compliance.\nBecause we have no employees, we are dependent on the External Manager to find, underwrite and close suitable investments on our behalf and to conduct all of our operations. Although our former employees became employees of the External Manager, the External Manager is not obligated to require these, or any other, employees to devote their time exclusively to us. As a result, the employees may not devote sufficient time to the management of our business operations, and in particular to sourcing and placing investments with us. Further, the Management Agreement does not require the External Manager to dedicate specific personnel to our operations and none of our former employees\u2019 continued service is guaranteed. If these individuals leave the External Manager or an affiliate thereof or are reallocated to other activities of the External Manager or its affiliates, the External Manager may be unable to replace them with persons with appropriate experience, or at all, and we may not be able to execute our business plan or maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nVarious termination provisions in the Management Agreement, including termination by us without cause, require us to pay the External Manager a substantial termination fee, which could deter termination or adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe initial term of our Management Agreement extends to December 31, 2022 and, unless terminated, the Management Agreement automatically renews thereafter for successive two-year terms. Either party may elect not to renew the Management Agreement effective upon the expiration of the initial term or any automatic renewal term, both upon 12 months\u2019 prior written notice. However, if we elect not to renew the Management Agreement on this basis, we are required to pay the External Manager a termination fee equal to three times the average annual management fee and incentive compensation earned by, plus one times the average annual amount of certain reimbursements received by, the External Manager during the 24-month period immediately preceding the effective date of termination, which could cause the termination fee to be substantial. These provisions may make it costly and difficult for us not to renew the Management Agreement. If we are required to pay the termination fee as a result of a termination, our results of operations and our shareholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected. The termination fee could also deter a third party who might be interested in purchasing the Company or depress the price they might be willing to pay.\nIf we terminate the Management Agreement without cause, we cannot hire the External Manager\u2019s employees, including our former employees, which could make it difficult for us to conduct our operations following any such termination.\nIf we terminate the Management Agreement without cause, we may not, for a period of two years, without the consent of the External Manager, employ any employee of the External Manager or any of its affiliates, or any person who was employed by the External Manager or any of its affiliates at any time within the two-year period immediately preceding the date we hire such person. This restriction applies to all of our former employees except that, if we have paid the termination fee described above, we may hire persons serving in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer/President and Chief Financial Officer. The inability to hire the External Manager\u2019s employees could make it more difficult for us to terminate the Management Agreement since we will need to find a new external manager or hire all new employees.\nThe fixed percentage component of the management fee payable to the External Manager is payable regardless of our performance.\nThe External Manager is entitled to receive a management fee from us that is based on a fixed percentage of our GAAP common shareholders\u2019 equity, regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio. For example, we would owe the External Manager a management fee for a specific period even if we experienced a net loss during that period. The External Manager\u2019s entitlement to a fee based on a fixed percentage of our GAAP common shareholders\u2019 equity excluding the carrying value of DTAs may encourage the External Manager to invest in riskier assets in order to grow the equity base upon which the fee is paid and may reduce its incentive to find investments that provide appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio. Similarly, the incentive compensation payable to the External Manager is based on year-over-\nyear increases in diluted common shareholders\u2019 equity per share, which could also encourage the External Manager to invest in riskier assets.\nExternal Manager\u2019s liability is limited under the Management Agreement and we have agreed to indemnify the External Manager against certain liabilities.\nUnder the terms of the Management Agreement, the External Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder in good faith and is not responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in following or declining to follow any advice or recommendations of the External Manager, including as set forth in the investment guidelines. Under the terms of the Management Agreement, the External Manager and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders and equity holders are not liable to us, our directors, shareholders or any subsidiary of ours, or their equity holders or partners for any acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim, by the enforcement of any judgment or assessment or any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable law, or otherwise, except by reason of acts or omissions constituting bad faith, actual and intentional fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties under the Management Agreement. We have agreed to indemnify the External Manager and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, trustees, control persons, partners, stockholders and equity holders with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from their acts or omissions not constituting bad faith, actual and intentional fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties under the Management Agreement. As a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which the External Manager would not be liable.\nAffiliates of the External Manager are engaged, or may engage, in similar businesses to ours and the External Manager may have conflicts of interest which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with Hunt, including the External Manager and its affiliates. The External Manager may be presented with investment opportunities that we would find attractive, but which it offers instead to its affiliates, some of which are engaged in businesses similar to ours. The External Manager may also have economic or transactional interests that are inconsistent with or adverse to our interests. We and our External Manager have policies and procedures in place to address conflicts of interest, but there is no guarantee that the policies and procedures adopted by us, the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement or the policies and procedures adopted by the External Manager, will enable us to identify, adequately address or mitigate all potential conflicts of interest. These factors could adversely impact our ability to make investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nA breach of the security of our External Manager\u2019s systems or those of other third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could damage or disrupt our business or result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information, which could damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur business is reliant upon the security and efficacy of our External Manager\u2019s information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) environment, as well as those of other third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties, particularly our External Manager.\nOur ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to our External Manager\u2019s IT systems or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than if those systems were our own. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as needed and some data might not have been backed up.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, particularly our External Manager, may be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, phishing attacks, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks. Our External Manager may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to protect the integrity of systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, particularly our External Manager, may not be able to anticipate all\nsecurity attacks or to implement appropriate preventive measures against security breaches. Any security breach or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of assets or harm our reputation. In addition, any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Shares\nOur shares are thinly traded and, as a result, the price at which they trade may not reflect their full intrinsic value.\nAlthough our shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market and are currently included in the Russell 2000 index, our shares remain thinly traded and any change in our representation in the Russell 2000 index may further reduce liquidity which could, in turn, adversely affect our share price. At this time, we do not have analysts actively tracking and publishing opinions on the Company and our stock, which may cause declines in trading volume or our share price due to limited visibility in the financial markets. Additionally, when we have repurchased our shares, the number of shares outstanding is reduced, which has the effect over time of further decreasing the trading volume of our shares. Accordingly, the trading price of our shares may not reflect their full intrinsic value. Since our shares are thinly traded, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at market prices or at any price at all if they desire to liquidate some or all of their shares in the Company.\nOur Rights Plan could depress our share price.\nUnder the Rights Plan, the acquisition by an investor (or group of related investors) of greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company, could result in all existing shareholders other than the new 4.9% holder having the right to acquire new shares for a nominal cost, thereby significantly diluting the ownership interest of the acquiring person. By discouraging acquisitions of greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company, the Rights Plan might limit takeover opportunities and, as a result, could depress our share price. At December 31, 2020, we had two shareholders, including one who is Chairman of the Board and our former Chief Executive Officer, Michael L. Falcone who held greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company. The Board named Mr. Falcone an exempt person in accordance with the Rights Plan. The Board determined that Mr. Falcone\u2019s exercise of his options and the required share purchases did not constitute a triggering event for purposes of our Rights Plan. In accordance with the Master Transaction Agreement dated January 8, 2018, Hunt remains an exempt person for purposes of the Rights Plan and may purchase up to 9.9% of the Company\u2019s shares in any rolling 12-month period, without causing a triggering event.\nAs a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer within the meaning of the Exchange Act, we utilize certain modified disclosure requirements, and we cannot be certain if these reduced requirements will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act. We have in this Report utilized, and we plan in future filings with the SEC to continue to utilize, certain reduced disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies, including but not limited to, reduced comparative financial statements and related disclosure in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;\u201d disclosure about our executive compensation, including the omission of a compensation discussion and analysis; and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk. In addition, as a smaller reporting company we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to utilize this extended transition period applicable to smaller reporting companies. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards as they become applicable to public companies.\nFurthermore, as a non-accelerated filer we are no longer subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the additional testing of our internal control over financial reporting as may occur when our independent registered public accounting firm attests as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our stock price may be more volatile.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains at least three groups of provisions that could have the effect of discouraging people from trying to acquire control of us. Those provisions are:\n\u25cf If any person or group acquires 10% or more of our shares, that person or group cannot, with a very limited exception (i) engage in a business combination with us (including an acquisition from us of more than 10% of our assets or more than 5% of our shares) within five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless our Board approved the business combination or acquisition of a 10% or greater interest in us before it took place, or the business combination is approved by two-thirds of the members of our Board and holders of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest or (ii) engage in a business combination with us until more than five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless the business combination is recommended by our Board and approved by holders of 80% of our shares or of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest.\n\u25cf The Company is governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, the Company will not engage in any business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder unless (i) the Board approved either the business combination or the transaction by which the shareholder became an interested shareholder, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, such shareholder owned at least 85% of the Company\u2019s voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, or (iii) at or after the time the shareholder became an interested shareholder the business combination was approved by the Board and by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is one who owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Company and includes certain affiliates and associates of the Company and of the interested shareholder.\n\u25cf Since one-third of our directors are elected each year to three-year terms this could delay the time when someone who acquires voting control of us could elect a majority of our directors.\nThe above provisions could deprive our shareholders of acquisition opportunities that might be attractive to many of them.", "PERMNO": 83827, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "MMAC"}
