{"cik": "1593195", "company": "Tribune Publishing Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider each of the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating the Company\u2019s common stock. Some of the following risks relate to the Company\u2019s business, indebtedness, the securities markets and ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock. Other risks relate to the separation from TCO and the effect of the separation from TCO. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the Company could be materially and adversely affected. If this occurs, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nAdvertising demand is expected to continue to be affected by changes in economic conditions and fragmentation of the media landscape.\nAdvertising revenue is our primary source of revenue. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. National and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, and circulation levels and rates, as well as federal, state and local election cycles, all affect demand for advertising.\nA decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Consolidation across various industries, such as large department store and telecommunications companies, may also reduce overall advertising revenue.\nCompetition from other media, including other metropolitan, suburban and national newspapers, broadcasters, cable systems and networks, satellite television and radio, websites, magazines, direct marketing and solo and shared mail programs, affects our ability to retain advertising clients and maintain or raise rates. In recent years, Internet sites devoted to recruitment, automotive and real estate have become significant competitors of our newspapers and websites for classified advertising, and retaining our historical share of classified advertising revenue remains a significant ongoing challenge.\nSeasonal variations in consumer spending cause our quarterly advertising revenue to fluctuate. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenue is typically higher than first and third quarter advertising revenue, reflecting the slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season.\nDemand for our products is also a factor in determining advertising rates. For example, circulation levels for our newspapers, which have been declining, are a factor in determining advertising rates.\nAll of these factors continue to contribute to a difficult advertising sales environment and may further adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain our advertising revenue.\nIncreasing popularity of digital media and the shift in newspaper readership demographics, consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional print to digital media have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operating revenues and may require significant capital investments due to changes in technology.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for delivery of news and other content and have resulted in a wide variety of consumer demands and expectations, which are also rapidly evolving. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available on the Internet, through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content, is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content. Further, as existing newspaper readers get older, younger generations may not develop similar readership habits. News aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by driving interaction away from our websites or our digital applications. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms.\nIn addition, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. Consequently, our digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. A decrease in our customers\u2019 advertising expenditures, reduced demand for our offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses and assets. Our inability to maintain and/or improve the performance of our customers\u2019 advertising results on our digital properties may negatively influence rates we achieve in the marketplace for our advertising inventory.\nPaywalls on our newspaper websites require users to pay for content after accessing a limited number of pages or news articles for free each month. Our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms through these packages depends on market acceptance, consumer habits, pricing, an adequate online infrastructure, terms of delivery platforms and other factors. If our print subscribers opt out of the digital packages in greater numbers than we anticipate, we may not generate expected circulation revenue. In addition, the paywall may result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our websites if digital viewers are unwilling to pay to gain access to our digital content. Stagnation or a decline in website traffic levels may adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue.\nTechnological developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our operating revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. Our advertising and circulation revenues have declined, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including declining newspaper buying (by young people in particular) and the migration to other available forms of media for news. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites proliferates.\nAny changes we make to our business model to address these challenges may require significant capital investments. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology\ninfrastructure. Some of our competitors may have greater operational, financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result, our digital businesses may be less successful, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nMacroeconomic trends may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating revenues are sensitive to discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as their perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Weak economic indicators in various regions across the nation, such as high unemployment rates, weakness in housing and continued uncertainty caused by national and state governments\u2019 inability to resolve fiscal issues in a cost efficient manner to taxpayers may adversely impact advertiser and subscriber sentiment. These conditions could impair our ability to maintain and grow our advertiser and subscriber bases.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets and our ability to maintain market share and generate operating revenues depends on how effectively we compete with our competition.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets. Our newspapers compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other newspapers as well as with other media such as the Internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, and yellow pages. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nOur newspaper publications generate significant percentages of their advertising revenue from a few categories, including automotive, employment, and real estate classified advertising. In recent years, websites dedicated to automotive, employment, and real estate advertising have become significant competitors of our newspapers and websites. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, technological, industry, or other changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could reduce advertising revenues and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating revenues primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation. Competition for advertising expenditures and paid circulation comes from a variety of sources, including local, regional and national newspapers, the Internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor billboards, and other media. Free daily newspapers have been recently introduced in several metropolitan markets, and there can be no assurance that free daily publications, or other publications, will not be introduced in any markets in which we publish newspapers. The National Do Not Call Registry has affected the way newspapers solicit home-delivery circulation, particularly for larger newspapers that historically have relied on telemarketing. Competition for newspaper advertising revenue is based largely upon advertiser results, advertising rates, readership, demographics, and circulation levels. Competition for circulation is based largely upon the content of the newspaper, its price, editorial quality, customer service, and other sources of news and information. Circulation revenue and our ability to achieve price increases for our print products may be affected by competition from other publications and other forms of media available in our various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographics. We may incur higher costs competing for advertising dollars and paid circulation. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertising dollars and paid circulation, our operating revenues may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDecreases, or slow growth, in circulation may adversely affect our circulation and advertising revenues.\nOur newspapers, and the newspaper industry as a whole, are experiencing challenges to maintain or grow print circulation and circulation revenue. This results from, among other factors, increased competition from other media, particularly the Internet, changing newspaper readership demographics and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. These factors could affect our ability to implement circulation price increases for our print products.\nIn addition, our circulation revenue is sensitive to discretionary spending available to subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as their perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Weak economic indicators in various regions across the nation may adversely impact subscriber sentiment and therefore impair our ability to maintain and grow our circulation.\nA prolonged decline in circulation could affect the rate and volume of advertising revenue. To maintain our circulation base, we may incur additional costs, and may not be able to recover these costs through circulation and advertising revenue. To address declining circulation, we may increase spending on marketing designed to retain our existing subscriber base and continue or create niche publications targeted at specific market groups. We may also increase marketing efforts to drive traffic to our proprietary websites.\nWe anticipate that readership analyses will become increasingly important now that the Alliance for Audited Media has agreed to publish readership statistics and recognize Internet use in addition to circulation information. We believe this is a positive industry development but we cannot predict its effect on advertising revenue.\nWe rely on revenue from the printing and distribution of publications for third parties that may be subject to many of the same business and industry risks that we are.\nIn 2014, we generated approximately 10.1% of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications, and our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts. As a result, if the macroeconomic and industry trends described herein such as the sensitivity to perceived economic weakness of discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers, circulation declines, shifts in consumer habits and the increasing popularity of digital media affect those third parties, we may lose, in whole or in part, a substantial source of revenue.\nA decision by any of the three largest national publications or the major local publications to cease publishing and distribution in those markets, or seek alternatives to their current business practice of partnering with us, could materially impact our profitability.\nNewsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control.\nNewsprint and ink expense was 8.6% of our total operating expenses in 2014. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the consolidation of North American newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers. We have historically been able to realize favorable newsprint pricing by virtue of our company-wide volume and a long-term contract with a significant supplier. Failure to maintain our current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain our existing relationships with our newsprint suppliers may adversely affect newsprint prices in the future.\nWe may not be able to adapt to technological changes.\nAdvances in technologies or alternative methods of content delivery or changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies could have a negative effect on our business. We cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our operations. In addition, the expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to do so could aggressively compete with our business.\nTechnological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit our ability to protect intellectual property rights.\nWe seek to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by us may not prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. Protection of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for various services.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for various services. We do not control the operation of these suppliers. If any of these third-party suppliers terminate their relationship with us, or do not provide an adequate level of service, it would be disruptive to our business as we seek to replace the supplier or remedy the inadequate level of service. This disruption may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected as a result.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we could be party to litigation, including matters relating to alleged libel or defamation, and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted.\nWe may not achieve the acquisition component of our business strategy, or successfully complete strategic acquisitions, investments or divestitures.\nWe continuously evaluate our businesses and make strategic acquisitions, investments and divestitures as part of our strategic plan. These transactions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions, investments or divestitures can be completed.\nAcquisitions are an important component of our business strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our business through acquisitions, that any businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. Future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest and amortization expense and significant charges relative to integration costs. Our strategy could be impeded if we do not identify suitable acquisition candidates and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if we overpay for acquisitions. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected returns.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including, (i) problems implementing disclosure controls and procedures for the newly acquired business; (ii) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits; (iii) unforeseen difficulties extending internal control over financial reporting and performing the required assessment at the newly acquired business; (iv) potential adverse short-term effects on operating results through increased costs or otherwise; (v) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business; (vi) diversion of management\u2019s attention and failure to recruit new, and retain existing, key personnel of the acquired business; (vii) failure to successfully implement systems integration; (viii) exceeding the capability of our systems; and (ix) the risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may not be able to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our senior management team.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our senior management team. There is no guarantee that they will not leave. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the failure to attract qualified persons to our senior management team may have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects.\nWe may be obligated to make greater contributions to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that cover our union-represented employees in the next several years than previously required, placing greater liquidity needs upon our operations.\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. We are the only employer whose employees represent more than 5% of the total participation of each of the Chicago Newspaper Publishers Drivers\u2019 Union Pension Plan (the \u201cDrivers\u2019 Plan\u201d) and the GCIU Employer Retirement Benefit Plan.\nOn March 31, 2010, the Drivers\u2019 Plan was certified by its actuary to be in critical status for the plan year beginning January 1, 2010. As a result, the trustees of the Drivers\u2019 Plan were required to adopt and implement a rehabilitation plan as of January 1, 2011 designed to enable the Drivers\u2019 Plan to cease being in critical status within the period of time stipulated by the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cIRC\u201d). The terms of the rehabilitation plan adopted by the trustees require Tribune Publishing to make increased contributions beginning on January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2025, and the trustees of the Drivers\u2019 Plan project that it will emerge from critical status on January 1, 2026. Based on the actuarial assumptions utilized as of January 1, 2010 to develop the rehabilitation plan, it is estimated that Tribune Publishing\u2019s remaining share of the funding obligations to the Drivers\u2019 Plan during the rehabilitation plan period is approximately $84.3 million as of December 28, 2014. The funding obligation is subject to change based on a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets as compared to assumed returns, changes in the number of plan participants and changes in the rate used for discounting future benefit obligations.\nThe risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer withdraws from or otherwise ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. Alternatively, if we stop participating in one of our multiemployer plans, we may incur a withdrawal liability based on the unfunded status of the plan.\nOur possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber and other sensitive data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, personal health information, and other personal information. Therefore, maintaining our network security is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers\u2019 networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including payment card (credit or debit) information, of our customers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee, can also result in a data breach. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers or users, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or users. As a result of any such breaches, customers or users may assert claims of liability against us and these activities may subject us to legal claims, adversely impact our reputation, and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nA significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a data breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect confidential customer data or to provide customers with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. We could also be subject to evolving state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor strikes, lockouts and protracted negotiations can lead to business interruptions and increased operating costs.\nAs of December 28, 2014, union employees comprised approximately 12% of our workforce. We are required to negotiate collective bargaining agreements across our business units on an ongoing basis. Complications in labor negotiations can lead to work slowdowns or other business interruptions and greater overall employee costs. If we or our suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by disrupting our ability to provide customers with our products or services. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage may have an adverse effect on our operating revenues, cash flows or operating income or the timing thereof.\nOur revenues and operating results fluctuate on a seasonal basis and may suffer if revenues during the peak season do not meet our expectations.\nOur advertising business is seasonal, and our quarterly revenues and operating results typically exhibit seasonality. Our revenues and operating results tend to be higher in second and fourth quarters than first and third quarters. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season. Our operating results may suffer if advertising revenues during the second and fourth quarter do not meet expectations. Our working capital and cash flows also fluctuate as a result of this seasonality. Moreover, the operational risks described elsewhere in these risk factors may be significantly exacerbated if those risks were to occur during the fourth quarter.\nWe may not be able to access the credit and capital markets at the times and in the amounts needed and on acceptable terms.\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital in place will permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (1) our financial performance, (2) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nWe may incur significant costs to address contamination issues at certain sites operated or used by our publishing businesses.\nIn connection with the distribution, we agreed to indemnify TCO for any claims or expenses related to certain identified environmental issues. The identified issues generally relate to sites previously owned, operated or used by TCO\u2019s\npublishing businesses and now used for our publishing businesses at which contamination was identified. Historically, TCO\u2019s publishing business was obligated to investigate and remediate contamination at certain of these sites. TCO was also required to contribute to cleanup costs at certain of these sites that were third-party waste disposal facilities at which it disposed of its wastes. We could have additional investigation and remediation obligations and be required to contribute to cleanup costs at these facilities. Environmental liabilities, including investigation and remediation obligations, could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards can significantly impact reported earnings and operating results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and accompanying pronouncements and implementation guidelines for many aspects of our business, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, pensions, income taxes and stock-based compensation are complex and involve significant judgment. Changes in these rules or their interpretation may significantly change our reported earnings and operating results.\nEvents beyond our control may result in unexpected adverse operating results.\nOur results could be affected in various ways by global or domestic events beyond our control, such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters. Such events can quickly result in significant declines in advertising revenue and significant increases in newsgathering costs.\nRisks Relating to the Distribution\nWe have limited operating history as a separate public company and may be unable to operate profitably as a stand-alone company.\nWe have limited operating history as a separate, stand-alone public company. Historically, because the publishing and the broadcasting businesses that comprised TCO had been under one ultimate parent, they had been able to rely, to some degree, on the earnings, assets, and cash flow of each other for capital requirements. Since the distribution, we are able to rely only on the publishing business for such requirements. We cannot assure you that, as a separate public company, operating results will continue at historical levels, or that we will be profitable. Additionally, prior to the distribution, we relied on TCO for various financial, administrative and managerial services in conducting our operations. Following the distribution, we maintain our own credit and banking relationships and perform our own financial and investor relations functions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully maintain the financial functions, administration and management necessary to operate as a separate company or that we will not incur additional costs operating as a separate public company. For example, prior to the distribution, we, as part of TCO\u2019s business, were able to use TCO\u2019s size to procure products and services on favorable terms. We could experience some increased costs after the distribution as a result of the absence of such economies of scale. Any such additional or increased costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future results as a separate public company.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this report for the period prior to the distribution may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate public company during the periods presented or be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be in the future as a separate public company. The historical financial information for the periods prior to the distribution does not reflect the increased costs associated with being a separate public company, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, financing, and operations of our business as a result of the distribution. Our historical financial information for the periods prior to the distribution reflects allocations for services historically provided by TCO, and we expect these allocated costs to be different from the actual costs we will incur for these services in the future as a separate public company. In some instances, the costs incurred for these services as a separate public company may be higher than the share of total TCO expenses allocated to our business historically.\nFor additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the notes thereto in this report.\nWe may incur increased costs after the distribution or as a result of the separation from TCO that may cause our profitability to decline.\nHistorically, our business has been operated as one of TCO\u2019s segments, and TCO has performed many corporate functions for our operations, including managing financial and human resources systems, internal auditing, investor relations, treasury services, select accounting functions, finance and tax administration, benefits administration, legal, governmental relations and regulatory functions. Following the distribution, TCO has provided transitional support to us with respect to certain of these functions for the periods specified in the transition services agreement and various other agreements. We have been replicating certain systems, infrastructure and personnel to which we no longer have access from TCO. However, we may misjudge our requirements for these services and systems on a stand-alone basis, and may incur greater than expected capital and other costs associated with developing and implementing our own support functions in these areas. These costs may exceed the costs we pay to TCO during the transition period.\nIn addition, there may be an adverse operational effect on our business as a result of the significant time our management and other employees and internal resources will need to dedicate to building these capabilities during the first few years following the distribution that otherwise would be available for other business initiatives and opportunities. As we operate these functions independently, if we have not developed adequate systems and business functions, or obtained them from other providers, we may not be able to operate the company effectively and our profitability may decline.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is expensive and time- consuming, and our accounting, management and financial reporting systems may not be adequately prepared to comply with public company reporting, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting requirements.\nWe have historically operated as a subsidiary of TCO and have not been subject to the same financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements as a public company. As a public company, we are required, among other things, to: (i) prepare and file periodic and current reports, and distribute other stockholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws, SEC reporting requirements and New York Stock Exchange rules; (ii) institute comprehensive compliance, investor relations and internal audit functions under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and (iii) evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight, which have increased our operating costs. These changes also place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems and may require us to upgrade our systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, IT systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting, legal and finance staff. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nIn particular, beginning with the year ending December 27, 2015, we will be required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, following the distribution, we are required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (at such time as it is required to do so), investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. If we are unable to upgrade our systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, IT systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting, legal and finance staff in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be impaired.\nAs discussed in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2014 relating to an insufficient complement of finance and accounting resources within the organization and an ineffective control environment. As a result of these material weaknesses, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 28, 2014. Although we have taken steps to remediate these material weaknesses (see Item 9A for a description of the identified material weaknesses and related remediation plans), we have not yet fully remediated these material weaknesses. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely manner or if the remediation measures that we have implemented and intend to implement are inadequate to address our existing material weaknesses or to identify or prevent additional material weaknesses, there will continue to be an increased risk of future material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements.\nWe may incur increased expenses if the transition services agreement and other agreements with TCO are terminated.\nIn connection with the distribution, we entered into a transition services agreement and various other agreements with TCO, pursuant to which TCO provides us with certain specified services on a transitional basis, including in such areas as human resources, risk management, treasury, legal, internal audit, technology support and other areas where we may need assistance and support following the distribution. Depending on the particular service being provided, the agreements extend for up to two years after the distribution, but may be terminated earlier under certain circumstances, including a default. If one or more of the agreements are terminated, we may be required to obtain such services from a third party. This may be more expensive than the fees that we are required to pay under the agreements with TCO.\nIf the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the IRC, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of TCO or Tribune Publishing, then TCO or TCO stockholders and warrantholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes, and Tribune Publishing may be obligated to indemnify TCO for such taxes imposed on TCO or TCO stockholders and warrantholders as a result thereof.\nTCO received a private letter ruling (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions qualify as tax-free to TCO, Tribune Publishing and the TCO stockholders and warrantholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS Ruling does not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution, and the parties rely solely on the opinion of counsel described below for comfort that such additional requirements are satisfied.\nIn connection with the distribution, TCO received an opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, special tax counsel to TCO, to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions qualify as tax-free to TCO and the stockholders and warrantholders of TCO. The opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel relied on the IRS Ruling as to matters covered by it.\nThe IRS Ruling and the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel are based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by TCO and certain of the TCO stockholders. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the IRS Ruling or the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the IRS Ruling and the opinion of TCO\u2019s special tax counsel are based on then current law, and cannot be relied upon if the law changes with retroactive effect.\nThe distribution is taxable to TCO pursuant to Section 355(e) of the IRC if there is a 50% or more change in ownership of either TCO or Tribune Publishing, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Section 355(e) might apply if other acquisitions of stock of TCO before or after the distribution, or of Tribune Publishing after the distribution, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. If Section 355(e) applied, TCO might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain.\nUnder the tax matters agreement, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, we are required to indemnify TCO against taxes on the distribution that arise as a result of our actions or failures to act after the distribution. See \u201c-Risks Relating to the Distribution-We will be unable to take certain actions after the distribution because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution, and such restrictions could be significant.\u201d In some cases, however,\nTCO might recognize gain on the distribution without being entitled to an indemnification payment under the tax matters agreement.\nWe will be unable to take certain actions after the distribution because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution, and such restrictions could be significant.\nThe tax matters agreement prohibits us from taking actions that could reasonably be expected to cause the distribution to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the IRS Ruling or opinions of counsel received by us or TCO. In particular, for two years after the distribution, we may not:\n\u2022\nenter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement or engage in any substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction involving the acquisition, issuance, repurchase or change of ownership of our capital stock, or options or other rights in respect of our capital stock, subject to certain exceptions relating to employee compensation arrangements and open market stock repurchases;\n\u2022\ncease the active conduct of our business; or\n\u2022\nvoluntarily dissolve, liquidate, merge or consolidate with any other person, unless we survive and the transaction otherwise complies with the restrictions in the tax matters agreement.\nNevertheless, we are permitted to take any of the actions described above if we obtain TCO\u2019s consent, or if we obtain a supplemental IRS private letter ruling (or an opinion of counsel that is reasonably acceptable to TCO) to the effect that the action will not affect the tax-free status of the distribution. However, the receipt by us of any such consent, opinion or ruling does not relieve us of any obligation we have to indemnify TCO for an action we take that causes the distribution to be taxable to TCO.\nBecause of these restrictions, for two years after the distribution, we may be limited in the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital. Also, our indemnity obligation to TCO may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during this two-year period in a transaction that our stockholders might consider favorable.\nAfter the distribution, certain members of management, directors and stockholders may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nAfter the distribution, our management and directors and the management and directors of TCO may own both TCO common stock and our common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our management and directors and TCO\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and TCO. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and TCO regarding the terms of the agreements governing the distribution and our relationship with TCO thereafter. These agreements include the separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, the transition services agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or TCO may enter into in the future.\nDirect or indirect ownership of our securities could result in the violation of the FCC\u2019s media ownership rules by investors with \u201cattributable interests\u201d in certain broadcast stations in the same market as one or more of our daily newspapers.\nIn connection with the distribution, stockholders of TCO received shares of our common stock. The FCC\u2019s \u201cNewspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule\u201d (the \u201cNBCO Rule\u201d) prohibits a person or entity from having an \u201cattributable\u201d ownership or positional interest in a broadcast station and a daily newspaper published in the same market. Under FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are considered \u201cattributable\u201d for purposes of applying the NBCO Rule: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least 5%; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20%, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless \u201cinsulated\u201d from day-to-day operational activities; and (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33% of a media company\u2019s total assets, if the holder supplies more than 15% of a broadcast station\u2019s\ntotal weekly programming or is a same-market broadcast company or daily newspaper publisher. Holders of attributable interests in broadcast stations and daily newspapers may have the effect of limiting the strategic business opportunities available to the broadcast company as a result of also holding an attributable interest in the newspaper company, including limiting the current ability of TCO to acquire or to continue to be licensed to operate broadcast stations in markets where Tribune Publishing publishes a daily newspaper. If an investor holds attributable ownership interests in both TCO and Tribune Publishing, for example, because TCO operates television stations and Tribune Publishing publishes daily newspapers in the same market, the FCC may require the common holder of attributable interests in both properties to reduce or eliminate one of their attributable interests as part of its action on any application filed by TCO.\nTCO\u2019s existing Chicago market radio/television/newspaper combination has been permanently grandfathered by the FCC, and its television/newspaper combinations in the New York, Los Angeles, Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Hartford-New Haven markets are subject to temporary waivers of the NBCO Rule granted on November 16, 2012, in connection with the FCC\u2019s approval of TCO\u2019s plan of reorganization (the \u201cExit Order\u201d). The temporary waivers, among other things, required TCO to come into compliance with the NBCO Rule within one year from the release date of the Exit Order, September 16, 2013. TCO filed with the FCC a request for extension of the temporary NBCO Rule waivers granted in the Exit Order on September 12, 2013 (in New York, Los Angeles, Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Hartford-New Haven). On September 4, 2014, the request was amended to reflect the spin-off of Tribune Publishing, with an indication that three current stockholders of TCO also hold attributable interests in Tribune Publishing.\nUnder the current policies of the FCC in applying the NBCO Rule, if a publisher of a daily newspaper such as Tribune Publishing acquires a daily newspaper giving rise to prohibited common cross-ownership with a broadcast licensee, such as TCO, the broadcast licensee generally is given until the date of its next renewal application to resolve the prohibited common ownership. Entities seeking FCC approval to acquire broadcast licensees are required to demonstrate compliance with the media ownership rules, including the NBCO Rule, or obtain waivers of those rules. On March 31, 2014, the FCC initiated its Congressionally-mandated 2014 Quadrennial Review proceeding, in which it is requesting comment on whether its media ownership rules, including the NBCO Rule, are necessary in the public interest as a result of competition. As part of this proceeding, the FCC may revisit the time provided for broadcast licensees to come into compliance with the NBCO Rule as the result of the acquisition of an attributable interest in a daily newspaper. The FCC has indicated it does not intend to act on the 2014 Quadrennial Review before June 30, 2016 at the earliest. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or whether or the extent to which the FCC will reauthorize TCO\u2019s existing temporary waivers or grant permanent or temporary waivers in the future.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws and Delaware corporate law may permit a court to void the distribution and related transactions, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn connection with the distribution, TCO undertook a series of internal corporate reorganization transactions which, along with the contribution of TCO\u2019s publishing businesses, the distribution of Tribune Publishing shares and the cash dividend paid to TCO, may be subject to challenge under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws as well as under Delaware corporate law. Under applicable laws, any transaction, contribution or distribution contemplated as part of the distribution could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if, among other things, the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the transfer.\nWe cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any entity involved in the distribution was insolvent at the relevant time. In general, however, a court would look at various facts and circumstances related to the entity in question, including evaluation of whether or not: (i) the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; (ii) the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or (iii) it could pay its debts as they become due.\nIf a court were to find that any transaction, contribution or distribution involved in the distribution was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the transaction, contribution or distribution. In addition, the distribution could also be voided if a court were to find that it is not a legal distribution or dividend under Delaware corporate law. The resulting complications, costs and expenses of either finding would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nIn connection with the distribution, we incurred indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our operating activities.\nIn connection with the distribution, on August 4, 2014 we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the \u201cTerm Collateral Agent\u201d), and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cSenior Term Facility\u201d) in which we borrowed $350 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to fund a cash dividend to TCO of $275 million immediately prior to the distribution. In addition, in connection with the distribution, on August 4, 2014 Tribune Publishing and the Subsidiary Guarantors, in their capacities as borrowers thereunder, entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent (in such capacity, the \u201cABL Collateral Agent\u201d), swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cSenior ABL Facility\u201d). The Senior ABL Facility with aggregate maximum commitments (subject to availability under a borrowing base) of approximately $140 million and entered into a letter of credit arrangement to allow up to $30 million of cash backed letters of credit, with $27.5 million issued on our behalf as of the distribution date. We also had $19.3 million of additional letters of credit issued under the Senior ABL Facility as of the distribution date and undrawn as of December 28, 2014. The Senior ABL Facility includes flexibility for additional letters of credit to be issued thereunder. In addition, subject to certain conditions, without the consent of the applicable then existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), each of the Senior ABL Facility and the Senior Term Facility may be expanded by certain incremental commitments by an amount up to (i) $75 million in the case of the Senior ABL Facility and (ii) in the case of the Senior Term Facility, (A) the greater of $100 million and an amount as will not cause the net senior secured leverage ratio after giving effect to such incurrence to exceed 2.00 to 1.00, plus (B) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of the term loans borrowed under the Senior Term Facility on the distribution date and refinancing debt in respect of such loans. Our level of debt could have important consequences to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent that our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness to capitalize on business opportunities which could increase the risks related to our high level of indebtedness.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities allow us and our subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in certain circumstances, including the incremental commitments under such facilities, and other debt which may be secured or unsecured. We may incur such additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or investments. If we incur such additional indebtedness, our interest and amortization obligations would likely increase and the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations will depend on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. For information regarding the risks to our business that could impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, see \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Business.\u201d If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and also restrict our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Senior ABL Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their loans and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these events could result in you losing some or all of the value of your investment.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests.\nThe agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictions might hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. A breach of the covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default may allow certain creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event the lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be: (i) limited in how we conduct our business; (ii) limited or unable to pay dividends to our stockholders in certain circumstances; (iii) unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or (iv) unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nOur indebtedness has variable rates of interest, which could subject us to interest rate risk or cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Senior ABL Facility are at variable rates of interest and, to the extent LIBOR exceeds 1.00%, borrowings under our Senior Term Facility are at variable rates of interest, which could expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels. If interest rates increase, our future debt service obligations on the variable rate portion of our indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all revolving loans are fully drawn under our Senior Credit Facilities and LIBOR exceeds 1.00%, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $1.2 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce future interest rate volatility. However, due to risks for hedging gains and losses and cash settlement costs, we may elect not to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nRisks Related to Tribune Media Company\u2019s Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe may not be able to settle, on a favorable basis or at all, unresolved claims filed in connection with the Chapter 11 proceedings and resolve the appeals seeking to overturn the order confirming the Plan.\nOn December 31, 2012, TCO and 110 of its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cDebtors\u201d) that had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) on December 8, 2008 (or on October 12, 2009, in the case of Tribune CNLBC, LLC) emerged from Chapter 11. Certain of the legal entities included in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of Tribune Publishing were Debtors or, as a result of the restructuring transactions undertaken at the time of the Debtors\u2019 emergence, are successor legal entities to legal entities that were Debtors. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information. The Debtors\u2019 Chapter 11 cases have not yet been closed by the Bankruptcy Court, and certain claims asserted against the Debtors in the Chapter 11 cases remain unresolved. As a result, we expect to continue to incur certain expenses pertaining to the Chapter 11 proceedings in future periods, which may be material.\nOn April 12, 2012, the Debtors, the official committee of unsecured creditors and creditors under certain TCO prepetition debt facilities filed the Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization for Tribune Company and its Subsidiaries (subsequently amended and modified, the \u201cPlan\u201d) with the Bankruptcy Court. On July 23, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Plan (the \u201cConfirmation Order\u201d). Several notices of appeal of the Confirmation Order have been filed. The appellants seek, among other relief, to overturn the Confirmation Order and certain prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court, including the settlement of certain claims and causes of action related to the Leveraged ESOP Transactions that was embodied in the Plan (see Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information). There is currently no stay of the Confirmation Order in place pending resolution of the confirmation-related appeals. In January 2013, TCO filed a motion before the Delaware District Court to dismiss the appeals as equitably moot, based on the substantial consummation of the Plan. On June 18, 2014 the Delaware District Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. On July 16, 2014, notices of appeal of the Delaware District Court\u2019s order were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by Aurelius, Law Debenture, and Deutsche Bank. Briefing before the Third Circuit was completed in February 2015, and no date has been set for oral argument. If the appellants were successful in overturning the Confirmation Order and certain prior orders of the Bankruptcy Court, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, tax matters agreement, separation and distribution agreement, employee matters agreement, transition services agreement, and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or to amend our amended and restated by-laws.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of the Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nUnder the tax matters agreement, we have agreed to indemnify TCO for certain tax related matters, and we may be unable to take certain actions after the distribution. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Distribution- We will be unable to take certain actions after the distribution because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution, and such restrictions could be significant.\u201d In addition, the separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement and the transition services agreement cover specified indemnification and other matters that may arise after the distribution. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement and the transition services agreement may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition of us or a disposition of our business.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSubstantially all of the shares of our common stock distributed in the distribution were eligible for immediate resale in the public market, except for shares held by \u201caffiliates\u201d (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act), which became eligible for resale six months following the distribution. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, our smaller size and different investment characteristics may not appeal to the stockholders of TCO who received shares of our common stock in the distribution, and they may seek to dispose of large amounts of our common stock. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient buying interest to offset any such sales, and, accordingly, the price of our common stock may be depressed by those sales and have periods of volatility.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and you may not be able to sell your common stock at the initial trading price.\nThere was no public market for our common stock prior to the distribution. An active public market for our common stock may not be sustained. Many factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to rise and fall, including the following: (i) declining newspaper print circulation; (ii) declining operating revenues derived from our core business; (iii) variations in quarterly results; (iv) announcements regarding dividends; (v) announcements of technological innovations by us or by competitors; (vi) introductions of new products or services or new pricing policies by us or by competitors; (vii) acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors; (viii) recruitment or departure of key personnel or key groups of personnel; (ix) the gain or loss of significant advertisers or other customers; (x) changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our stock; and (xi) market conditions in the newspaper industry, the media industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by restrictions under our Senior Credit Facilities and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\nWe expect to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. However, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. The declaration and payment of dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including actual results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law, our taxable income, our operating expenses, changes in our business needs, including working capital and funding for business initiatives or acquisitions, changes in corporate strategy, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. We expect to cause our subsidiaries to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient for us to pay dividends. However, their ability to make such distributions will be subject to their operating\nresults, cash requirements and financial condition and the applicable provisions of Delaware law that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution, and our ability to pay cash dividends will be subject to covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, including under our Senior Credit Facilities, and other agreements with third parties.\nIn addition, each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of its cash obligations, including the payment of dividends or distributions. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the security or industry analysts downgrades our stock, ceases coverage of our company, fails to publish reports on us regularly, or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, demand for our stock may decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 14781, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "TPCO"}
