Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report. These and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the global attempt to contain it may harm our business, results of operations and ability to execute on our business plan.\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. In response to government mandates, health care advisories and otherwise responding to employee, customer and supplier concerns, we have altered certain aspects of our operations. Our workforce has had to spend a significant amount of time working from home, which has not significantly impacted their productivity. While many of our operations can be performed remotely, there is no guarantee that we remain as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed, many employees have had additional personal needs to attend to (such as looking after children as a result of school closures or family who become sick), and employees have or may become sick themselves and be unable to work. Our suppliers and vendors have similarly had their operations altered. To the extent the resulting economic disruption continues, we could see some vendors go out of business, resulting in supply constraints and increased costs or delays in meeting the needs of our patients.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will continue to depend on numerous other evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u25cf the duration and scope of the pandemic, including disproportionate impacts on the Company\u2019s patient population, the effectiveness and timing of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts;\n\u25cf governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic;\n\u25cf the availability and cost to access the capital markets;\n\u25cf our ability to pursue, diligence, finance and integrate acquisitions;\n\u25cf our ability to comply with financial and operating covenants in our debt and operating lease agreements;\n\u25cf potential for goodwill impairment charges;\n\u25cf our ability to comply with the reporting requirements necessary to retain the CARES Act provider relief funds we received;\n\u25cf the effect on our patients, physician and facility referral sources and demand for and ability to pay for medical services;\n\u25cf disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to travel and to work, including as a result of their health and wellbeing;\n\u25cf availability of third-party providers to whom we outsource portions of our internal business functions, including billing and administrative functions relating to revenue cycle management; and\n\u25cf increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working conditions.\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, we may not be able to provide the same level of service and products that our patients, physicians and facility referral sources are used to, which could negatively impact their perception of our products or services. Furthermore, given increased government expenditures associated with their COVID-19 response, we could see increased government obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such further alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below, including as a result of, but not limited to, the factors listed above.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s reliance on relatively few suppliers for the majority of its patient service equipment and supplies could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to operate.\nAdaptHealth currently relies on a relatively small number of suppliers to provide it with the majority of its patient service equipment and supplies. Significant price increases, or disruptions in the ability to obtain such equipment and supplies from existing suppliers, may force AdaptHealth to use alternative suppliers. Additionally, any new excise taxes imposed on manufacturers of certain medical equipment could be passed on to customers, such as AdaptHealth. Such manufacturers may be forced to make other changes to their products or manufacturing processes that are unacceptable to AdaptHealth, resulting in a need to change suppliers. Any change in suppliers AdaptHealth uses could cause delays in the delivery of such products and possible losses in revenue, which could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s results of operations. In addition, alternative suppliers may not be available, or may not provide their products and services at similar or favorable prices. If AdaptHealth cannot obtain the patient service equipment and supplies it currently uses, or alternatives at similar or favorable prices, AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to provide such products may be severely impacted, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted manufacturing in all of the regions where AdaptHealth\u2019s suppliers manufacture their products. While the global closures and limitations on movement related to COVID-19 were temporary, and while such closures, limitations and related impacts have not materially disrupted AdaptHealth\u2019s supply chain to date, such supply chain disruption remains possible and the financial impact of any such disruption cannot be estimated at this time. Should such closures and limitations on movement be reinstated or continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth is affected by continuing efforts by private third-party payors to control their costs. If AdaptHealth agrees to lower its reimbursement rates due to pricing pressures from private third-party payors, AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would likely deteriorate.\nAdaptHealth derived approximately 62% and 57% of its revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from third-party private payors. Such payors continually seek to control the cost of providing healthcare services through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased oversight and greater enrollment of patients in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These private payors are increasingly demanding discounted fee structures, including setting reimbursement rates based on Medicare fee schedules or requiring healthcare providers or suppliers to assume a greater degree of financial risk related to patient care. Reimbursement rates under private payor programs may not remain at current levels and may not be sufficient to cover the costs of caring for patients enrolled in such programs, and AdaptHealth may experience a deterioration in pricing flexibility, changes in payor mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of increases in payments by private third-\nparty payors. AdaptHealth may be compelled to lower its prices due to increased pricing pressures, which could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in governmental or private payor supply replenishment schedules could adversely affect AdaptHealth.\nAdaptHealth generated approximately 29% and 42% of its revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, through the sale of masks, tubing and other ancillary products related to patients utilizing CPAP devices. Medicare, Medicaid and private payors limit the number of times per year that patients may purchase such supplies. To the extent that any governmental or private payor revises their resupply guidelines to reduce the number of times such supplies can be purchased, such reductions could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth generates a significant portion of its revenue from the provision of sleep therapy equipment and supplies to patients, and AdaptHealth\u2019s success is therefore highly dependent its ability to furnish these items.\nApproximately 39% and 58% of AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was generated from the provision of sleep therapy equipment and supplies to patients. AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategy therefore depends upon the adoption by patients, physicians and sleep centers, among others, of AdaptHealth\u2019s sleep therapy equipment and supplies to treat their patients suffering from OSA. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will continue to maintain broad acceptance among physicians and patients. Any failure by AdaptHealth to satisfy physician or patient demand or to maintain meaningful market acceptance will harm its business and future prospects.\nAdaptHealth may be adversely affected by consolidation among health insurers and other industry participants.\nIn recent years, a number of health insurers have merged or increased efforts to consolidate with other non-governmental payors. Insurers are also increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives with healthcare providers. Consolidation within the health insurance industry may result in insurers having increased negotiating leverage and competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data. AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to negotiate prices and favorable terms with health insurers in certain markets could be affected negatively as a result of this consolidation. In addition, the shift toward value-based payment models could be accelerated if larger insurers, including those engaging in consolidation activities, find these models to be financially beneficial. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to negotiate favorable terms with payors and otherwise respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation in the payor industry or vertical integration efforts.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s payor contracts are subject to renegotiation or termination, which could result in a decrease in AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue or profits.\nThe majority of AdaptHealth\u2019s payor contracts are subject to unilateral termination by either party on between 30 and 90 days\u2019 prior written notice. Such contracts are routinely amended (sometimes by unilateral action by payors regarding payment policy), renegotiated, subjected to a bidding process with AdaptHealth\u2019s competitors, or terminated altogether. Sometimes in the renegotiation process, certain lines of business may not be renewed or a payor may enlarge its provider network or otherwise change the way it conducts its business in a way that adversely impacts AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue. In other cases, a payor may reduce its provider network in exchange for lower payment rates. AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue from a payor may also be adversely affected if the payor alters its utilization management expectations and/or administrative procedures for payments and audits, changes its order of preference among the providers to which it refers business or imposes a third-party administrator, network manager or other intermediary. Any reduction in AdaptHealth\u2019s projected home respiratory therapy/home medical equipment revenues as a result of these or other factors could lead to a reduction in AdaptHealth\u2019s revenues. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth\u2019s payor contracts will not be terminated or altered in ways that are unfavorable to AdaptHealth as a result of renegotiation or such administrative changes. Payors may decide to refer business to their owned provider subsidiaries, such as specialty\npharmaceuticals and/or HME networks owned by such payors or by third-party management companies. These activities could materially reduce AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue from these payors.\nChanges made by payors to the way they cover products supplied by AdaptHealth could have and adverse impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue and operations.\nPayors that provide coverage for products supplied by AdaptHealth can make changes to their plans and benefit designs that can have an impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue and operations. Some payors have shifted coverage for CGM from the medical benefit to the pharmacy benefit for their insureds. The impact of changing the benefit can include changes to the types of providers that can provide CGM, increased competition from pharmacies, changes to covered amounts, and changes to patient deductibles. Additionally, including CGM under the pharmacy benefit could allow pharmacy benefit managers to attempt to restrict how beneficiaries obtain CGM, including attempts to shift to specifically contracted providers with reduced reimbursement to the supplier or pharmacy. AdaptHealth cannot predict whether such modifications to plan design or benefits will have an adverse impact on its revenue and operations.\nIf AdaptHealth fails to manage the complex and lengthy reimbursement process, its revenue, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nBecause AdaptHealth depends upon reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and third-party payors for a significant majority of its revenues, AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations may be affected by the reimbursement process, which in the healthcare industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that services are rendered and the time that the reimbursement amounts are settled. Depending on the payor, AdaptHealth may be required to obtain certain payor-specific documentation from physicians and other healthcare providers before submitting claims for reimbursement. Certain payors have filing deadlines and will not pay claims submitted after such deadlines. AdaptHealth cannot ensure that it will be able to effectively manage the reimbursement process and collect payments for its equipment and services promptly.\nFailure by AdaptHealth to maintain controls and processes over billing and collections or the deterioration of the financial condition of AdaptHealth\u2019s payors or disputes with third parties could have a significant negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe collection of accounts receivable requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to improve upon or maintain its current levels of collectability and days sales outstanding in future periods. Further, some of AdaptHealth\u2019s payors and/or patients may experience financial difficulties, or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due, resulting in increased write-offs. If AdaptHealth is unable to properly bill and collect its accounts receivable, its financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time AdaptHealth is involved in disputes with various parties, including its payors and their intermediaries regarding their performance of various contractual or regulatory obligations. These disputes sometimes lead to legal and other proceedings and cause AdaptHealth to incur costs or experience delays in collections, increases in its accounts receivable or loss of revenue. In addition, in the event such disputes are not resolved in AdaptHealth\u2019s favor or cause AdaptHealth to terminate its relationships with such parties, there may be an adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIf AdaptHealth is unable to maintain or develop relationships with patient referral sources, its growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s success depends in large part on referrals from acute care hospitals, sleep laboratories, pulmonologist and endocrinologist offices, skilled nursing facilities, hospice operators and other patient referral sources in the communities served by AdaptHealth. By law, referral sources cannot be contractually obligated to refer patients to any specific provider. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s relationships with referral sources are subject to federal and state healthcare laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law to the extent these services provide a financial benefit to or relieve a financial burden for a potential referral source, or are subsequently found not to be for fair market value. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2009-\u2009Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\u2009-\u2009AdaptHealth is subject, directly or\nindirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and AdaptHealth may become subject to such litigation. If AdaptHealth is unable to or has not fully complied with such laws, it could face substantial penalties.\u201d However, there can be no assurance that other market participants will not attempt to steer patients to competing post-acute providers or otherwise limit AdaptHealth\u2019s access to potential referrals. The establishment of joint ventures or networks between referral sources, such as acute care hospitals, and other post-acute providers may hinder patient referrals to AdaptHealth. AdaptHealth\u2019s growth and profitability depend on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of inpatient rehabilitation, home health, and hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to maintain its existing referral source relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. AdaptHealth\u2019s loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to grow its business and operate profitably.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business depends on its information systems, including software licensed from third parties, and any failure or significant disruptions of these systems, security breaches or loss of data could materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business depends on the proper functioning and availability of its computer systems and networks. AdaptHealth relies on an external service provider to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of AdaptHealth\u2019s primary information systems used for its operational needs. AdaptHealth licenses third-party software that supports intake, personnel scheduling and other human resources functions, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling AdaptHealth to standardize the care delivered across its network of locations and monitor its performance and consumer outcomes. AdaptHealth also uses a third-party software provider for its order processing and inventory management platform. To the extent that its third-party providers fail to support, maintain and upgrade such software or systems, or if AdaptHealth loses its licenses with third-party providers, the efficiency of AdaptHealth\u2019s operations could be disrupted or reduced.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, AdaptHealth faces increased cybersecurity risks due to its reliance on internet technology and the number of its employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. AdaptHealth can provide no assurance that its current information technology systems, or those of the third parties upon which it relies, are fully protected against cybersecurity threats. It is possible that AdaptHealth or its third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity and other breach incidents that remain undetected for an extended period. Even when a security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be determined immediately. If AdaptHealth experiences a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of its information systems, its operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. If AdaptHealth experiences difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or is unable to implement, maintain, or expand its systems properly, AdaptHealth could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, delays, cessation of service, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses and other harm to its business and competitive position.\nThere can be no assurance that AdaptHealth\u2019s and its third-party software providers\u2019 safety and security measures and disaster recovery plan will prevent damage, interruption or breach of its information systems and operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, AdaptHealth may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications AdaptHealth develops or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of its information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to AdaptHealth\u2019s systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom AdaptHealth does business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving its employees or contractors. On occasion, AdaptHealth has acquired additional information systems through its business acquisitions. AdaptHealth has upgraded and expanded its information system capabilities and has committed significant\nresources to maintain, protect, enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of AdaptHealth\u2019s operations. A cyber security attack or other incident that bypasses AdaptHealth\u2019s information systems security could cause a security breach which may lead to a material disruption to its information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or patient health information. If a cyber-security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access AdaptHealth\u2019s systems or facilities were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may materially impact AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to provide various healthcare services.\nAny successful cyber security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access AdaptHealth\u2019s or its acquisition targets\u2019 systems or facilities also could result in negative publicity which could damage its reputation or brand with its patients, referral sources, payors or other third parties and could subject AdaptHealth to substantial penalties under HIPAA and other federal and state data protection laws, in addition to private litigation with those affected. Failure to maintain the security and functionality of AdaptHealth\u2019s information systems and related software, or a failure to defend a cyber-security attack or other attempt to gain unauthorized access to AdaptHealth\u2019s or its acquisition targets\u2019 systems, facilities or patient health information, could expose AdaptHealth to a number of adverse consequences, the vast majority of which are not insurable, including but not limited to disruptions in AdaptHealth\u2019s operations, regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties, fines, investigations and enforcement actions (including, but not limited to, those arising from the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General or state attorneys general), private litigation with those affected by the data breach, loss of customers, disputes with payors and increased operating expense, which could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, on June 28, 2019, Solara Medical Supplies (\u201cSolara\u201d), which was acquired by AdaptHealth in July 2020, determined that an unauthorized third-party gained access to a limited number of employee Microsoft Office accounts beginning in April 2019, as a result of a phishing email campaign. Solara undertook a comprehensive review of the accounts to identify what personal information was stored within the accounts and to whom that information related. In connection with the incident, Solara notified potentially affected individuals and reported this incident to law enforcement and relevant state and federal regulators. Investigations by applicable regulators are ongoing, and Solara is defending a class action regarding the incident in federal court. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation or litigation, although responding to these matters or any unfavorable outcome in connection therewith could have an adverse impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations following consummation of the acquisition of Solara.\nAdaptHealth experiences competition from numerous other home respiratory and mobility equipment providers, and this competition could adversely affect its revenues and its business.\nThe home respiratory and mobility equipment markets are highly competitive and include a large number of providers, some of which are national providers, but most of which are either regional or local providers, including hospital systems, physician specialists and sleep labs. The primary competitive factors are quality considerations such as responsiveness, access to payor contracts, the technical ability of the professional staff and the ability to provide comprehensive services. These markets are very fragmented. Some of AdaptHealth\u2019s competitors may now or in the future have greater financial or marketing resources than AdaptHealth. In addition, in certain markets, competitors may have more effective sales and marketing activities. AdaptHealth\u2019s largest national home respiratory/home medical equipment provider competitors include Apria Healthcare Group Inc., Lincare Holdings Inc. and Rotech Healthcare Inc. The rest of the homecare market in the United States consists of regional providers and product-specific providers, as well as numerous local organizations. Hospitals and health systems are routinely looking to provide coverage and better control of post-acute healthcare services, including homecare services of the types AdaptHealth provides. These trends may continue as new payment models evolve, including bundled payment models, shared savings programs, value-based purchasing and other payment systems.\nThere are relatively few barriers to entry in local home healthcare markets, and new entrants to the home respiratory/home medical equipment markets could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth\u2019s business, results of\noperations and financial condition. A number of manufacturers of home respiratory equipment currently provide equipment directly to patients on a limited basis. Such manufacturers have the ability to provide their equipment at prices below those charged by AdaptHealth, and there can be no assurance that such direct-to-patient sales efforts will not increase in the future or that such manufacturers will not seek reimbursement contracts directly with AdaptHealth\u2019s third-party payors, who could seek to provide equipment directly to patients from the manufacturer. In addition, pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health Corporation and the OptumRx business of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, could enter the HME market and compete with AdaptHealth. Large technology companies, such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alphabet Inc., have disrupted other supply businesses and have publicly stated an interest in entering the healthcare market. In the event such companies enter the HME market, AdaptHealth may experience a loss of referrals or revenue.\nChanges in medical equipment technology and development of new treatments may cause AdaptHealth\u2019s current equipment or services to become obsolete.\nAdaptHealth evaluates changes in home medical equipment technology and treatments on an ongoing basis for purposes of determining the feasibility of replacing or supplementing items currently included in the patient service equipment inventory and services that AdaptHealth offers patients. AdaptHealth\u2019s selection of medical equipment and services is formulated on the basis of a variety of factors, including overall quality, functional reliability, availability of supply, payor reimbursement policies, product features, labor costs associated with the technology, acquisition, repair and ownership costs and overall patient and referral source demand, as well as patient therapeutic and lifestyle benefits. Manufacturers continue to invest in research and development to introduce new products to the marketplace. It is possible that major changes in available technology, payor benefit or coverage policies related to those changes or the preferences of patients and referral sources may cause AdaptHealth\u2019s current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete, and it will be necessary to adapt to those changes. Unanticipated changes could cause AdaptHealth to incur increased capital expenditures and accelerated equipment write-offs, and could force AdaptHealth to alter its sales, operations and marketing strategies.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s operations involve the transport of compressed and liquid oxygen, which carries an inherent risk of rupture or other accidents with the potential to cause substantial loss.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the transportation of medical gas products and compressed and liquid oxygen, including ruptures, leaks and fires. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of AdaptHealth\u2019s related operations. If a significant accident or event occurs, it could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations. Additionally, corrective action plans, fines or other sanctions may be levied by government regulators who oversee transportation of hazardous materials such as compressed or liquid oxygen.\nAdaptHealth provides a significant number of patients with oxygen-based therapy, and from time to time, AdaptHealth has operated medical gas facilities in several states subject to federal and state regulatory requirements. AdaptHealth\u2019s medical gas facilities and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and other federal and state authorities. The FDA regulates medical gases, including medical oxygen, pursuant to its authority under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Among other requirements, the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulations impose certain quality control, documentation and recordkeeping requirements on the receipt, processing and distribution of medical gas. Further, in each such state, its medical gas facilities would be subject to regulation under state health and safety laws, which vary from state to state. The FDA and state authorities conduct periodic, unannounced inspections at medical gas facilities to assess compliance with the cGMP and other regulations, and AdaptHealth expends significant time, money and resources in an effort to achieve substantial compliance with the cGMP regulations and other federal and state law requirements at each of its medical gas facilities. AdaptHealth also complies with the FDA\u2019s requirement for medical gas providers to register their sites with the agency. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be successful and that AdaptHealth\u2019s medical gas facilities will maintain compliance with federal and state law regulations. Failure by AdaptHealth to maintain regulatory compliance at its medical gas facilities could result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines, product recalls or seizures, temporary or permanent injunctions, or suspensions in operations at one or more\nlocations, and civil or criminal penalties which would materially harm its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nOur ability to successfully operate our business is largely dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel of AdaptHealth, including senior management. The loss of such key personnel could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nAdaptHealth is highly dependent on the performance and continued efforts of its senior management team. AdaptHealth\u2019s future success is dependent on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified executive officers and senior management. Any inability to manage AdaptHealth\u2019s operations effectively could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully operate our business is also dependent upon the efforts of certain other key personnel of AdaptHealth. It is possible that AdaptHealth will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic growth plan, which involves the acquisition of other companies, may not succeed.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic plan calls for significant growth in its business over the next several years through an increase in its density in select markets where it is established as well as the expansion of its geographic footprint into new markets. This growth would place significant demands on AdaptHealth\u2019s management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional resources. As a result, AdaptHealth could be required to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding AdaptHealth\u2019s information technology infrastructure. If AdaptHealth is unable to effectively manage growth, its financial results could be adversely impacted.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic plan also contemplates continued growth from future acquisitions of home medical equipment providers. AdaptHealth may face increased competition for attractive acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to AdaptHealth or lead to the payment of higher prices for its acquisitions. Without successful acquisitions, AdaptHealth\u2019s future growth rate could decline. In addition, AdaptHealth cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s strategic plan contemplates successful integration of acquired home medical equipment providers with AdaptHealth\u2019s existing business, including reduction in operating expenses with respect to the acquired companies. Integrating an acquisition could be expensive and time-consuming and could disrupt AdaptHealth\u2019s ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel from day-to-day operations. AdaptHealth may not be able to combine successfully the operations of recently acquired companies with its operations, and, even if such integration is accomplished, AdaptHealth may never realize the potential benefits of such acquisition.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on AdaptHealth\u2019s operations or other projects and may impose challenges on us including, but not limited to, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies and business cultures. There can be no assurance that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nSpecific integration risks relating to the acquisition of other companies by AdaptHealth may include:\n\u25cf difficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit, including patient transitions, product and service offerings, distribution and operational capabilities and business cultures;\n\u25cf availability of financing to the extent needed to fund acquisitions;\n\u25cf customer loss and other general business disruption;\n\u25cf managing the integration process while completing other independent acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u25cf assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including unforeseen or contingent liabilities or liabilities in excess of the amounts estimated;\n\u25cf failure to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u25cf potentially substantial costs and expenses associated with acquisitions and dispositions;\n\u25cf failure to retain and motivate key employees;\n\u25cf coordinating research and development activities to enhance the introduction of new products and services;\n\u25cf difficulties in establishing and applying AdaptHealth\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to an acquired business;\n\u25cf obtaining necessary regulatory licenses and payor-specific approvals, which may impact the timing of when AdaptHealth is to bill and collect for services rendered;\n\u25cf AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to transition patients in a timely manner may impact AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to collect amounts for services rendered;\n\u25cf AdaptHealth\u2019s estimates for revenue accruals during the integration of acquisitions may require adjustments in future periods as the transition of patient information is finalized; and\n\u25cf delays in obtaining new government and commercial payor identification numbers for acquired branches, resulting in a slowdown and/or loss of associated revenue.\nIn addition, AdaptHealth faces competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to AdaptHealth or lead to the payment of higher prices for its acquisitions. There can be no assurance that AdaptHealth will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that any such opportunities, if identified, will be consummated on favorable terms, if at all. Without successful acquisitions, AdaptHealth\u2019s future growth rate could decline.\nWhile AdaptHealth conducts due diligence in connection with any acquisition opportunity, there may be risks or liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not disclosed to AdaptHealth or that AdaptHealth inadequately assesses. The failure to timely identify any material liabilities associated with any acquisitions could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical and economic conditions, including significant global or regional developments such as economic and political events, international conflicts, natural disasters and public health crises that are out of AdaptHealth\u2019s control, could adversely affect its revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond its control, such as general geopolitical, economic and business conditions, financial services market conditions, and general political and economic developments, including slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven economic recovery, government actions impacting trade agreements including the imposition of trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction, tax legislation increasing the federal corporate income tax rates, natural and other disasters and public health crises affecting the operations of AdaptHealth or its customers or suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many of these conditions. Any Medicare, Medicaid or\nthird-party payor reimbursement reductions as a result of such factors could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Turmoil in the financial markets, including in the capital and credit markets, and any uncertainty over its breadth, depth and duration may put pressure on the global economy and could have a negative effect on AdaptHealth\u2019s business. Further, historical worldwide financial and credit turmoil could reduce the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide. The shortage of liquidity and credit combined with substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could cause an economic recession in the United States or worldwide. If financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experience extreme disruption, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, governments may take unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that may include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. If conditions in the global economy, U.S. economy or other key vertical or geographic markets are weak or uncertain, AdaptHealth could experience material adverse impacts on its revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth currently outsources, and from time to time in the future may outsource, a portion of its internal business functions to third-party providers. Outsourcing these functions has significant risks, and AdaptHealth\u2019s failure to manage these risks successfully could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdaptHealth currently, and from time to time in the future, may outsource portions of its internal business functions, including billing and administrative functions relating to revenue cycle management, to third-party providers in India, the Philippines and Central America. These third-party providers may not comply on a timely basis with all of AdaptHealth\u2019s requirements, or may not provide AdaptHealth with an acceptable level of service. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s reliance on third-party providers could have significant negative consequences, including significant disruptions in its operations and significantly increased costs to undertake its operations, either of which could damage AdaptHealth\u2019s relationships with its customers. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s outsourced functions may be negatively impacted by any number of factors, including political unrest; public health crises; social unrest; terrorism; war; vandalism; currency fluctuations; changes to the law of India, the Philippines, the United States or any of the states or other jurisdictions in which AdaptHealth does business or outsources operations; or increases in the cost of labor and supplies in India, the Philippines or Central America or any other jurisdiction in which AdaptHealth outsources any portion of its internal business functions. AdaptHealth\u2019s outsourced operations may also be affected by trade restrictions, such as tariffs or other trade controls. As a result of its outsourcing activities, it may also be more difficult for AdaptHealth to recruit and retain qualified employees for its business needs at any time. AdaptHealth\u2019s failure to successfully outsource certain of its business functions could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of AeroCare into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the AeroCare Acquisition.\nThe success of the AeroCare Acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of AeroCare with our business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the AeroCare acquisition, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of AeroCare with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the AeroCare acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe incurred significant costs in connection with the AeroCare acquisition. We may incur additional costs in the integration of AeroCare\u2019s business, and may not achieve cost synergies and other benefits sufficient to offset the incremental costs of the AeroCare acquisition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nAdaptHealth\u2019s revenue could be impacted by federal and state changes to reimbursement and other Medicaid and Medicare policies.\nAdaptHealth derived approximately 28% and 32% of its revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from Medicare and various state-based Medicaid programs. These programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes affecting overall spending, base rates or basis of payment, retroactive rate adjustments, annual caps that limit the amount that can be paid (including deductible and coinsurance amounts) for rehabilitation therapy services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries, administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates and frequency at which these programs reimburse AdaptHealth. For example, the Medicaid Integrity Program is increasing the scrutiny placed on Medicaid payments and could result in recoupments of alleged overpayments. Healthcare providers, suppliers, and payors are facing increasing pressure to reduce healthcare costs, and recent budget proposals and legislation at both the federal and state levels have called for cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. Enactment and implementation of measures to reduce or delay reimbursement or overall Medicare or Medicaid spending could result in substantial reductions in AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue and profitability. Payors may disallow AdaptHealth\u2019s requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or considered medically necessary. Revenue from third-party payors can be retroactively adjusted after a new examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. AdaptHealth may also be subject to pre-payment review of certain service lines or equipment segments as a result of negative audit findings or other third-party payor determinations, which can result in significant delays in claims processing and could materially impact its revenue.\nAs a result of the Public Health Emergency Declaration, National Emergency Declaration, and pursuant to the provisions of the CARES Act, among other things, CMS has issued regulatory guidance indicating enforcement discretion and flexibility regarding the provisions of items and services by Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, & Supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d) suppliers like AdaptHealth. These provisions have been announced through blanket waivers under Section 1135 of the Social Security Act, two Interim Final Rules with Requests for Comment on April 6, 2020 and May 8, 2020, respectively, and through numerous forms of subregulatory guidance. These provisions include modifications of various requirements under CMS regulations and Medicare and Medicaid program rules that aim to expand the capacity of healthcare providers and suppliers to deliver healthcare services while minimizing the risk of viral exposure. However, many of the provisions regarding documentation, coverage and flexibilities remain subject to further guidance and interpretation by CMS and Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d), among others. Due to the speed with which this guidance was issued, neither CMS nor the MACs have fully addressed the impact of this guidance on medical review of claims or audits. CMS and MACs continue to update guidance regarding coverage criteria, documentation requirements, and in-person encounter requirements for Durable Medical Equipment (\u201cDME\u201d) through their websites and other media. CMS\u2019s changes include the exercise of enforcement discretion with respect to the clinical conditions and face-to-face encounter requirements required under certain national and local coverage determinations applicable to certain items and supplies AdaptHealth offers. However, because these waivers and flexibilities may not fully describe the precise scope of the waiver or enforcement discretion, CMS, MACs and other Medicare or Medicaid auditors may challenge documentation for individual claims in pre-payment or post-payment audits. Further, the CMS or MACs may continue to modify or clarify this guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that affects AdaptHealth\u2019s operations or cash flows. Because the guidance issued changes frequently, AdaptHealth may be required to modify its compliance process and operations to remain in compliance with such guidance.\nThe CARES Act also provides for a temporary suspension of reduced rates for items and services provided by AdaptHealth. Under existing regulations, CMS applies a blended payment rate for DME furnished in rural or noncontiguous non-competitive bidding areas. Pursuant to provisions of the CARES Act, through December 31, 2020 or the end of the public health emergency, whichever occurs later, that blended rate will be based on 50% of the adjusted fee schedule amount (adjusted based on competitively bid prices) and 50% of the unadjusted DMEPOS fee schedule amount. Under prior law, DME furnished in non-rural or contiguous areas would not have been eligible for this blended rate, and instead many DMEPOS suppliers would likely have experienced reduced payments reflecting competitively bid prices. The CARES Act introduces a new blended rate for DME furnished in non-rural or contiguous non-competitive\nbidding areas that is based on 75% of the adjusted fee schedule amount and 25% of the unadjusted fee schedule amount. For non-rural or contiguous non-competitive bidding areas, the blended rate will revert to 100% of the Medicare fee schedule at the end of the public health emergency, if the emergency ends before December 31, 2020. On October 27, 2020, CMS proposed extending the transitional blended rate through April 1, 2021 or the end of the public health emergency, whichever is later.\nThe October 27, 2020 CMS proposed rules also proposed different payment models for the period after April 1, 2020 or the end of the public health emergency, whichever is later. The proposed rule provides for different blended rates based on a patient\u2019s location. CMS indicated it is considering extending the transitional adjustments to the fee schedule for product categories that were not awarded in the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. In the October 27 proposed rule, CMS has also proposed adding coverage under the DME benefit for adjunctive or non - therapeutic continuous glucose monitors (i.e. continuous glucose monitors used by Medicare beneficiaries who must verify their glucose levels with a blood glucose monitor). While AdaptHealth cannot predict what Medicare payment rates or coverage determinations will be in effect in future years, changes to payment rates or benefit coverages may materially impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe CARES Act temporarily suspends the 2% payment adjustment currently applied to all Medicare fee-for-service claims due to sequestration. The suspension is effective for claims with dates of service from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. However, CMS and MACs may issue guidance or interpret the law in a manner that limits the scope of this provision in the CARES Act, which may adversely affect AdaptHealth. Additionally, the impact of the temporary suspension of sequestration for Medicare Advantage may depend on specific AdaptHealth individual contracts with Medicare Advantage Organizations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform efforts, including repeal of or significant modifications to the ACA.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a number of laws that are intended to result in significant changes to the healthcare industry. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), the most prominent of these reform efforts. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the former presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to the ACA, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, effective January 1, 2019, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the lower court\u2019s finding that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in this case and in February 2021 the current presidential administration urged the Court to uphold the ACA; however, it remains unclear when and how the Supreme Court will rule. These and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA may result in reduced funding for state Medicaid programs, lower numbers of insured individuals, and reduced coverage for insured individuals. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants. Government efforts to repeal or change the ACA or to implement alternative reform measures could cause AdaptHealth\u2019s revenues to decrease to the extent such legislation reduces Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement rates.\nIf CMS requires prior authorization or implements changes in documentation necessary for AdaptHealth\u2019s products, AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nCMS has established and maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization of certain DMEPOS items identified as being subject to unnecessary utilization. This list identifies items that CMS has determined could potentially be subject to Prior Authorization as a condition of Medicare payment. Since 2012, CMS has also maintained a list of categories of DMEPOS items that require face-to-face encounters with practitioners and written orders before the DMEPOS supplier may furnish the items to beneficiaries. In a final rule issued in 2019, CMS\ncombined and harmonized the two lists to create a single unified list (the \u201cMaster List\u201d). CMS also reduced the financial threshold for inclusion on the Master List. With certain exceptions for reductions in Payment Threshold, items remain on the Master List for ten years from the date the item was added to the Master List. The presence of an item on the Master List does not automatically mean that prior authorization is required. Under the 2019 final rule, CMS selects items from the Master List for inclusion on the \u201cRequired Prior Authorization List.\u201d The expanded Master List would increase the number of DMEPOS items potentially eligible to be selected for prior authorization, face-to-face encounter and written order prior to delivery requirements as a condition of payment. CMS has added certain items that are part of AdaptHealth\u2019s product lines to the Master List and CMS may include the Company\u2019s products on the Required Prior Authorization List. If CMS adds additional products to the Master List, expands the list of items subject to prior authorization, or expands face-to-face encounter requirements or provisions requiring a written order prior to deliver, these changes may adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results from operations.\nReimbursement claims are subject to audits by various governmental and private payor entities from time to time and such audits may negatively affect AdaptHealth\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth receives a substantial portion of its revenues from the Medicare program. Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including HME providers, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as MACs that, among other things, process and pay Medicare claims, auditors contracted by CMS, and insurance carriers, as well as the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cOIG-HHS\u201d), CMS and state Medicaid programs. These include specific requirements imposed by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor (\u201cDME MAC\u201d) Supplier Manuals, Medicare DMEPOS enrollment requirements and Medicare DMEPOS Supplier Standards. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, government agencies or their contractors, including MACs, Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201cRACs\u201d), Unified Program Integrity Contractors (\u201cUPICs\u201d) and Zone Program Integrity Contractors (\u201cZPICs\u201d), often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered and compliance with government program claim submission requirements. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. Negative audit findings or allegations of fraud or abuse may subject AdaptHealth or its individual subsidiaries to liability, such as overpayment liability, refunds or recoupments of previously paid claims, payment suspension, or the revocation of billing or payment privileges in governmental healthcare programs. If CMS or a state Medicaid agency determines that certain actions of the Company or an affiliated subsidiary present an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse, they may suspend the billing or payment privileges of the entity, deny the entity\u2019s enrollment or revalidation for Medicare or Medicaid participation, and potentially deny the re-enrollments of other commonly owned entities. Such actions, if imposed on the Company or its subsidiaries, could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn many instances, there are only limited publicly-available guidelines and methodologies for determining errors with certain audits. As a result, there can be a significant lack of clarity regarding required documentation and audit methodology. The clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of physicians not employed by AdaptHealth, is essential to successfully challenging any payment denials. For example, certain provisions under CMS guidance manuals, local coverage determinations, and the DME MAC Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the \u201cpatient\u2019s medical record\u201d is required to justify the initial and ongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and other government contractors have taken the position, that the \u201cpatient\u2019s medical record\u201d refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but instead to documentation maintained by the patient\u2019s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information created by the DME supplier\u2019s personnel and confirmed by the patient\u2019s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. If treating physicians do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, the risks that the Company will be subject to audits and payment denials are likely to increase. Moreover, auditors\u2019 interpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation, leading to significant increases in individual supplier and industry-wide perceived error rates. High error rates could lead to further audit activity and regulatory burdens, and could result in AdaptHealth making significant refunds and other payments to Medicare and other government programs. Accordingly, AdaptHealth\u2019s future revenues and cash flows from government healthcare programs may be reduced. Private payors also may conduct audits and may take legal action to recover alleged overpayments. AdaptHealth could be adversely affected in some of the markets in which it operates if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to AdaptHealth due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support\nmedical necessity determinations. AdaptHealth cannot currently predict the adverse impact these measures might have on its financial condition and results of operations, but such impact could be material.\nMoreover, provisions of the ACA implemented by CMS require that overpayments be reported and returned within 60 days of the date on which the overpayment is \u201cidentified.\u201d Any overpayment retained after this deadline may be considered an \u201cobligation\u201d for purposes of the False Claims Act, liability for which can result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties. CMS currently requires a six-year \u201clookback period,\u201d for reporting and returning overpayments.\nOn June 26, 2020 and February 17, 2021, respectively, two acquired subsidiaries of AdaptHealth received notices of suspension of Medicare payment privileges from the CMS UPIC for the western jurisdiction. Both notices stated that the suspension was based upon a determination that such subsidiaries, each single supplier entities, had billed for services which were not rendered and/or were medically unnecessary, and improperly solicited beneficiaries. The Company is in the process of responding to both suspensions. As previously noted, the subsidiaries will not be paid for items provided to Medicare beneficiaries until the suspension is lifted, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in reinstating such payment privileges. The supplier entities represent less than two percent (2%) of the Company\u2019s annual revenue. The Company does not believe that these suspensions will have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAdaptHealth cannot currently predict the adverse impact, if any, that these audits, determinations, methodologies and interpretations might have on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant reimbursement reductions and/or exclusion from markets or product lines could adversely affect AdaptHealth.\nAll Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program contracts expired on December 31, 2018, and, as a result, there is a temporary gap in the entire DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program that CMS stated would last until December 31, 2020, and be replaced by a single round of competition named \u201cRound 2021\u201d which consolidated the competitive bidding areas (\u201cCBAs\u201d) included in the Round 1 2017 and Round 2 Recompete DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Programs. Round 2021 contracts were scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2021, and extend through December 31, 2023. CMS included 16 product categories in the Round 2021. On April 10, 2020, CMS announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it removed the non-invasive ventilators product category from the Round 2021 DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program.\nOn October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it would not award competitive bid contracts in 13 of the 15 remaining product categories due to a failure to achieve expected savings, and that contract awards would only be made for off-the-shelf (OTS) knee and back braces. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated with respect to providing OTS knee and back braces (excluding amounts generated in non-rural and rural non-bid areas) were not material. AdaptHealth expects to obtain contracts for OTS knee and back braces, and does not expect the single payment amounts imposed by CMS under such contracts to have a material impact on the Company.\nThe competitive bidding process (which is expected to be re-bid every three years) has historically put pressure on the amount AdaptHealth is reimbursed in the markets in which it exists, as well as in areas that are not subject to the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. The rates required to win future competitive bids could continue to depress reimbursement rates. AdaptHealth will continue to monitor developments regarding the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. While AdaptHealth cannot predict the outcome of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program on its business in the future nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, the program may materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure by AdaptHealth to successfully design, modify and implement technology-based and other process changes to maximize productivity and ensure compliance could ultimately have a significant negative impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth has identified a number of areas throughout its operations, including revenue cycle management and fulfilment logistics, where it intends to centralize and/or modify current processes or systems in order to attain a higher level of productivity or ensure compliance. Failure to achieve the cost savings or enhanced quality control expected from the successful design and implementation of such initiatives may adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid often change their documentation requirements with respect to claims submissions. The standards and rules for healthcare transactions, code sets and unique identifiers also continue to evolve, such as ICD 10 and HIPAA 5010 and other data security requirements. Moreover, government programs and/or commercial payors may have difficulties administering new standards and rules for healthcare transactions and this may adversely affect timelines of payment or payment error rates. The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program also imposes new reporting requirements on contracted providers. Failure by AdaptHealth to successfully design and implement system or process modifications could have a significant impact on its operations and financial condition. From time to time, AdaptHealth\u2019s outsourced contractors for certain information systems functions, such as Brightree LLC and Parachute Health LLC, may make operational, leadership or other changes that could impact AdaptHealth\u2019s plans and cost-savings goals. The implementation of many of the new standards and rules will require AdaptHealth to make substantial investments. Further, the implementation of these system or process changes could have a disruptive effect on related transaction processing and operations. If AdaptHealth\u2019s implementation efforts related to systems development are unsuccessful, AdaptHealth may need to write off amounts that it has capitalized related to systems development projects. Additionally, if systems development implementations do not occur, AdaptHealth may need to incur additional costs to support its existing systems.\nAdaptHealth is subject, directly or indirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and AdaptHealth may become subject to such litigation. If AdaptHealth is unable to or has not fully complied with such laws, it could face substantial penalties.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s operations are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, AdaptHealth\u2019s sales, marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and, as applicable under state law, Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral. Various states have corollary laws to the Stark Law, including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state.The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. The False Claims Act defines \u201cknowingly\u201d to include actual knowledge, acting in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of information, or acting in deliberate disregard of the truth or falsity of information. False Claims Act liability includes liability for reverse false claims for avoiding or\ndecreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money to the government. This includes False Claims Act liability for failing to report and return overpayments within 60 days of the date on which the overpayment is \u201cidentified.\u201d Penalties under the False Claims Act can include exclusion from the Medicare program. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nFor example, as previously disclosed, on July 25, 2017, AdaptHealth was served with a subpoena by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\u201cEDPA\u201d) pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a73486 (investigation of a federal health care offense) to produce certain audit records and internal communications regarding ventilator billing. The investigation appears to be focused on billing practices regarding one payor that contracted for bundled payments for certain ventilators. AdaptHealth has cooperated with investigators and, through agreement with the EDPA, has submitted all information requested. An independent third party was retained by AdaptHealth that identified overpayments and underpayments for ventilator billings related to the payor, and a remittance was sent to reconcile that account. On October 3, 2019, AdaptHealth received a follow-up civil investigative demand from the EDPA regarding a document previously produced to the EDPA and patients included in the review by the independent third party. AdaptHealth has responded to the EDPA and supplemented its production as requested. On November 9, 2020, the EDPA indicated to the Company that the investigation remained ongoing. The EDPA also requested additional information regarding certain patient services and claims refunds processed by AdaptHealth in 2017. The Company is compiling this information in coordination with the EDPA. While AdaptHealth cannot provide any assurance as to whether the EDPA will seek additional information or pursue this matter further, it does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAdditionally, in March 2019, prior to its acquisition by AdaptHealth, AeroCare was served with a civil investigative demand (\u201cCID\u201d) issued by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky (\u201cWDKY\u201d). The CID seeks to investigate allegations that AeroCare improperly billed, or caused others to improperly bill, for oxygen tank contents that were not delivered to beneficiaries. The WDKY has requested documents related to such oxygen tank content billing as well as other categories of information. AeroCare has cooperated with the WDKY and has produced documents and provided explanations of its billing practices. In September 2020, the WDKY indicated the investigation includes alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and as well as alleged violations of state Medicaid false claims acts in ten states. AeroCare has cooperated fully with the investigation and has indicated to the WDKY that concerns raised do not accurately identify Medicare coverage criteria and that state Medicaid coverage requirements generally do not provide for separate reimbursement for portable gaseous oxygen contents in the circumstances at issue. While AdaptHealth cannot provide any assurance as to whether the WDKY will seek additional information or pursue this matter further, it does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth.\nHIPAA, and its implementing regulations, also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nFrom time to time, AdaptHealth has been and is involved in various governmental audits, investigations and reviews related to its operations. Reviews and investigations can lead to government actions, resulting in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way\nAdaptHealth conducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement, or Corporate Integrity Agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d). If AdaptHealth fails to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, becoming subject to these governmental investigations, audits and reviews may result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention from the business as AdaptHealth cooperates with the government authorities, regardless of whether the particular investigation, audit or review leads to the identification of underlying issues.\nAdaptHealth is unable to predict whether it could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If AdaptHealth is found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, AdaptHealth may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations.\nFailure by AdaptHealth to maintain required licenses and accreditation could impact its operations.\nAdaptHealth is required to maintain a significant number of state and/or federal licenses for its operations and facilities. Certain employees are required to maintain licenses in the states in which they practice. AdaptHealth manages the facility licensing function centrally. In addition, individual clinical employees are responsible for obtaining, maintaining and renewing their professional licenses, and AdaptHealth has processes in place designed to notify branch or pharmacy managers of renewal dates for the clinical employees under their supervision. State and federal licensing requirements are complex and often open to subjective interpretation by various regulatory agencies. Accurate licensure is also a critical threshold issue for the Medicare enrollment and the Medicare competitive bidding program. From time to time, AdaptHealth may also become subject to new or different licensing requirements due to legislative or regulatory requirements developments or changes in its business, and such developments may cause AdaptHealth to make further changes in its business, the results of which may be material. Although AdaptHealth believes it has appropriate systems in place to monitor licensure, violations of licensing requirements may occur and failure by AdaptHealth to acquire or maintain appropriate licensure for its operations, facilities and clinicians could result in interruptions in its operations, refunds to state and/or federal payors, sanctions or fines or the inability to serve Medicare beneficiaries in competitive bidding markets which could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAccreditation is required by most of AdaptHealth\u2019s managed care payors and is a mandatory requirement for all Medicare DMEPOS providers. If AdaptHealth or any of its branches lose accreditation, or if any of its new branches are unable to become accredited, such failure to maintain accreditation or become accredited could adversely impact AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security, and consumer protection laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNumerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient privacy and consumer privacy, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information or personal information. Such laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, marketing and advertising, and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that varies from one jurisdiction to another and/or may conflict with other laws or regulations. As a result, AdaptHealth\u2019s practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by AdaptHealth or any of its third-party partners or service providers to comply with privacy policies or federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which they may be subject, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection, could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against AdaptHealth by governmental entities, consumers, users, suppliers or others. These\nproceedings may result in financial liabilities or may require AdaptHealth to change its operations, including ceasing the use or sharing of certain data sets.\nHIPAA and the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, require AdaptHealth to comply with standards for the use and disclosure of health information within AdaptHealth and with third parties. HIPAA and the HITECH Act also include standards for common healthcare electronic transactions and code sets, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information, and privacy and security of individually identifiable health information.\nHIPAA requires healthcare providers, including AdaptHealth, in addition to health plans and clearinghouses, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to protected health information that is used or disclosed. The HITECH Act included notification requirement for breaches of patient-identifiable health information, restricts certain disclosures and sales of patient-identifiable health information and provides a tiered system for civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties.\nIn addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for protected health information and the CCPA\u2019s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, the CCPA may increase AdaptHealth\u2019s compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states.\nAdditionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require AdaptHealth to publish statements that describe how it handles personal information and choices individuals may have about the way AdaptHealth handles their personal information. If such information that AdaptHealth publishes is considered untrue, it may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC, violating consumers\u2019 privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.\nUnder the Federal CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (\u201cTCPA\u201d) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Medicare regulations, AdaptHealth is limited in the ways in which it can market and service its products and services by use of email, text or telephone marketing. The actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. Numerous class-action suits under federal and state laws have been filed in recent years against companies who conduct SMS texting programs, with many resulting in multi-million-dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. Any future such litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend. For example, the TCPA, a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls, faxes and text messages, restricts telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messages without proper consent. Additionally, state regulators may determine that telephone calls to patients of AdaptHealth are subject to state telemarketing regulations. If AdaptHealth does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to telephone contacts or patient health information, it could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, the HITECH Act, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which AdaptHealth handles healthcare-related data and communicates with payors, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of consumer phone\ncalls, emails and text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability, could be required to change some portions of our business model, could face negative publicity and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our phone, email or SMS text practices by our consumers, regulatory authorities or other third parties could result in negative publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.\nIf AdaptHealth\u2019s subsidiary fails to comply with the terms of its Corporate Integrity Agreement, it could be subjected to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or termination from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nBraden Partners, L.P. (\u201cBP\u201d), d/b/a Pacific Pulmonary Services (\u201cPPS\u201d), which was acquired by AdaptHealth in May 2018, entered into a five-year CIA with the OIG-HHS, effective March 31, 2017, concurrent with the execution of a settlement agreement with the United States, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG-HHS. The CIA imposes certain compliance, auditing (including by an independent review organization), self-reporting and training requirements with which BP must comply. If BP fails to comply with the terms of its CIA, it could be subjected to substantial monetary penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Any such suspension, exclusion or termination would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and/or licenses and potentially have a material adverse effect on the results of BP\u2019s operations. The imposition of monetary penalties and/or termination of contracts with respect to BP could adversely affect AdaptHealth\u2019s profitability and financial condition. The CIA has a five-year term which is expected to expire by April 1, 2022. In connection with the acquisition and integration of PPS by AdaptHealth, the OIG-HSS confirmed that the CIA\u2019s risk adjustment requirements and independent claims review would only apply to the operations of BP and therefore no operations of AdaptHealth or any other affiliate are subject to these CIA requirements following the acquisition. On January 17, 2021, the OIG notified PPS that its report for the period ended March 31, 2020 had been accepted and PPS had satisfied its obligations under the CIA as of such date.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nIf AdaptHealth were required to write down all or part of its goodwill its net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents a significant portion of AdaptHealth\u2019s assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. For example, if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If, as part of our annual review of goodwill, we are required to write down all or a significant part of AdaptHealth\u2019s goodwill, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected, which could affect our flexibility to obtain additional financing. In addition, if our assumptions used in preparing our valuations for purposes of impairment testing differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future and our financial results may be materially adversely affected. AdaptHealth had $998.8 million and $266.8 million of goodwill recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. It is not possible at this time to determine if there will be any future impairment charge, or if there is, whether such charges would be material.\nAdaptHealth may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required payments or meet operating covenants under its long-term debt and long-term operating leases.\nFailure to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required payments or meet operating covenants under AdaptHealth\u2019s long-term debt and long-term operating leases could result in defaults under such agreements and cross-defaults under other debt or operating lease arrangements, which could harm its operating subsidiaries. AdaptHealth may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest, principal and lease payments. In addition, AdaptHealth\u2019s current indebtedness contain restrictive covenants and require AdaptHealth to maintain or satisfy specified coverage tests. These restrictions and operating covenants include, among other things, requirements with respect to total leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. These restrictions, together with the restrictive\ncovenants included in the BM Notes, may interfere with AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to obtain additional advances under its existing credit facility or to obtain new financing or to engage in other business activities, which may inhibit AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to grow its business and increase revenue. In addition, failure by AdaptHealth to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of its debt.\nAdaptHealth may need additional capital to fund its operating subsidiaries and finance its growth, and AdaptHealth may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to grow.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s ability to maintain and enhance its operating subsidiaries and equipment to meet regulatory standards, operate efficiently and remain competitive in its markets requires AdaptHealth to commit substantial resources to continued investment in its affiliated facilities and equipment. Additionally, the continued expansion of its business through the acquisition of existing facilities, expansion of existing facilities and construction of new facilities may require additional capital, particularly if AdaptHealth were to accelerate its acquisition and expansion plans. Financing may not be available or may be available only on terms that are not favorable. In addition, some of AdaptHealth\u2019s outstanding indebtedness restricts, among other things, its ability to incur additional debt. If AdaptHealth is unable to raise additional funds or obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, it may have to delay or abandon some or all of its growth strategies. Further, if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted. Any newly issued equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the Common Stock.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on AdaptHealth\u2019s outstanding variable rate indebtedness.\nCertain of AdaptHealth\u2019s indebtedness, including LIBOR Rate Loans under its credit facility, bears interest at variable interest rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform and, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of AdaptHealth\u2019s variable rate indebtedness. In the event that LIBOR is no longer available as a reference rate or is replaced by SOFR in the future, AdaptHealth\u2019s credit facility permits its lenders, in good faith, to unilaterally suspend maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans under the credit facility and to adopt a new rate, such as SOFR. As a result, AdaptHealth may need to renegotiate its outstanding indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth\u2019s current insurance program may expose it to unexpected costs and negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if it incurs losses not covered by its insurance or if claims or losses differ from its estimates.\nThere is an inherent risk of liability in the provision of healthcare services. As participants in the healthcare industry, AdaptHealth may periodically be subject to lawsuits, some of which may involve large claims and significant costs to defend, such as mass tort or other class actions. Although AdaptHealth\u2019s insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that it believes are reasonable based on its operations, the coverage under its insurance programs may not be adequate to protect it in all circumstances. AdaptHealth\u2019s insurance policies contain exclusions and conditions that could have a materially adverse impact on AdaptHealth\u2019s ability to receive indemnification thereunder, as well as customary sub-limits for particular types of losses. Additionally, insurance companies that currently insure companies in AdaptHealth\u2019s industry may cease to do so, may change the coverage provided or may substantially increase premiums in the future. The incurrence of losses and liabilities that exceed\nAdaptHealth\u2019s available coverage, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdaptHealth currently self-insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers\u2019 compensation, automobile liability and employee health insurance programs and, to offset negative insurance market trends, AdaptHealth may elect to increase its self-insurance coverage, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying its liabilities for these losses could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on AdaptHealth\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if AdaptHealth experiences a greater number of these losses than it anticipates, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur only significant asset is our ownership of AdaptHealth Holdings, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of AdaptHealth Holdings. We depend on AdaptHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends with respect to our Class A Common Stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing the indebtedness of AdaptHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from AdaptHealth Holdings. The earnings from, or other available assets of, AdaptHealth Holdings and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations or pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock. To the extent that we require funds and AdaptHealth Holdings or its subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to pay our income taxes when due.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nFluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment.\nAs an active market for our Class A Common Stock continues to develop, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our Class A Common Stock and our Class A Common Stock may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for it. In such circumstances, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our Class A Common Stock may include:\n\u25cf the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf success of competitors;\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning AdaptHealth or the home medical equipment industry in general;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf our ability to meet compliance requirements;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u25cf inability to quickly remediate material weaknesses or the continued identification of material weaknesses;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the volume of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our Class A Common Stock, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our Class A Common Stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable to us.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we are required to provide attestation on internal controls, and we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those that were required of AdaptHealth Holdings as a privately held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that became applicable to us after the Business Combination. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nAs described in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2020 because material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of measures to remediate the material weaknesses described therein; however, if we are unable to remediate our material weaknesses in a timely manner or we identify additional material weaknesses, we may be unable to provide required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information. For example, as described in Note 20, Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited), included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and notes thereto, as a result of the corrections relating to the accounting for the Contingent Consideration Common Shares discussed therein, the Company has corrected previously disclosed unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for 2020 quarterly periods. The existence of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of us. In addition, we have and will continue to incur additional costs to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d.\nCertain of our principal stockholders have significant influence over us.\nAs of January 1, 2021, Q Management Services (PTC) Ltd., as Trustee of Everest Trust, beneficially owned approximately 15.6% of our Class A Common Stock, assuming the exercise of 665,628 private placement warrants held by Clifton Bay Offshore Investments L.P. and 41,473 private placement warrants held by Quadrant Management LLC. As of January 1, 2021, the OEP Purchaser beneficially owned approximately 14.4% of our Class A Common Stock. As long as Q Management Services (PTC) Ltd., as Trustee of the Everest Trust, and/or the OEP Purchaser own or control a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to significantly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our \u201cCharter\u201d) or Amended and Restated Bylaws (our \u201cBylaws\u201d), or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets.\nThe interests of Q Management Services (PTC) Ltd., as Trustee of the Everest Trust, and/or the OEP Purchaser may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. Each of Q Management Services (PTC) Ltd., as Trustee of the Everest Trust, and the OEP Purchaser is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Each of Q Management Services (PTC) Ltd., as Trustee of the Everest Trust, and the OEP Purchaser may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Our Charter provides that our stockholders and our directors, including any who were designated by any of our stockholders, other than any such persons who are employees of us or any of our subsidiaries, do not have any obligation to offer to us any corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware prior to offering such opportunities to other entities with which they may be affiliated, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a result of being a public company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will continue to face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that AdaptHealth Holdings did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements increases costs and makes certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require us to carry out activities AdaptHealth had not undertaken prior to the Business Combination. In addition, additional expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements will continue to be incurred. We have and will continue to incur additional costs to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with our status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the board of directors or as\nexecutive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. Furthermore, certain of the key personnel of AdaptHealth may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nCertain of AdaptHealth\u2019s management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nCertain of AdaptHealth\u2019s executive officers and certain directors have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. AdaptHealth\u2019s management team may not successfully or effectively manage its transition to a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the company. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A Common Stock unless you sell our Class A Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe are required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement, which we entered into at the Closing with certain pre-Business Combination owners of AdaptHealth Units (collectively, the \u201cTRA Holders\u201d), generally provides for the payment by us of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the Closing as a result of: (i) certain tax attributes of Access Point Medical, Inc. existing prior to the Business Combination; (ii) certain increases in tax basis resulting from exchanges of AdaptHealth Units; (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement; and (iv) certain increases in tax basis resulting from payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be significant and is dependent upon significant future events and assumptions, including the timing of the exchanges of AdaptHealth Units, the price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable transactions and the amount of the exchanging TRA Holder\u2019s tax basis in its AdaptHealth Units at the time of the relevant exchange. The amount of such cash payments is also based on assumptions as to the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. Moreover, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. We are dependent on distributions from AdaptHealth Holdings to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and we cannot guarantee that such distributions will be made in sufficient amounts or at the times needed to enable us to make our required payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement, or at all. Any payments made by us to the TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and therefore, may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the TRA Holders maintaining a continued ownership interest in AdaptHealth Holdings or us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if we undergo a change of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Holders that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) we would be required to make a cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control due to the additional transaction costs a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Holders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Holder will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nCertain of the TRA Holders have substantial control over us, and their interests, along with the interests of other TRA Holders, in our business may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.\nThe TRA Holders may receive payments from us under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon any redemption or exchange of their AdaptHealth Units, including the issuance of shares of our Class A Common Stock upon any such redemption or exchange. As a result, the interests of the TRA Holders may conflict with the interests of holders of our Class A Common Stock. For example, the TRA Holders may have different tax positions from us which could influence\ntheir decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax or other considerations of TRA Holders even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nSimultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 4,333,333 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at $11.50 per share. As of December 31, 2020, there were 4,280,548 private placement warrants outstanding. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our stockholders and increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe currently qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we plan to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock in the IPO, which would be December 31, 2023. AdaptHealth had revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.06 billion. If we continue to expand our business through acquisitions and/or continue to grow revenues organically, or if we continue to issue debt, including to fund such acquisitions, we may cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2023. For instance, we expect to exceed $1.07 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, meaning we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we may no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2021 due to the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates, assuming no material decline in the market price of our Class A Common Stock as of June 30, 2021.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the same time private companies are required to adopt the new or revised standard. Investors may find our Class A Common Stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are also currently a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d In the event that we are still considered a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d at such time as we cease being an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d Specifically, similar to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; may be\nexempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nOur Charter requires that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur Charter requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, other than any claim to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of the State of Delaware, the stockholder bringing such suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Our Charter further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business. Although the Delaware Supreme Court recently held that exclusive forum provisions of federal district courts of the United States of America for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.", "PERMNO": 17684, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "AHCO"}
