{"cik": "868278", "company": "ProPhase Labs, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, actual results to differ from our expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this Annual Report and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, may also affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully offer, perform or generate revenues from our lab diagnostic services.\nWe face substantial risks and uncertainties to which our diagnostic services business is subject. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must, among other things, successfully execute our business strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract and retain qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will operate profitably or that our business strategy will be successful. As a result, our diagnostic services business may not succeed. Our ability to generate revenues from COVID-19 and other RPP molecular testing, and our ability to generate profits from our diagnostic services business, will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf the level of demand for COVID-19 testing in light of widespread and effective vaccination and other successful containment efforts;\n\u25cf the level of demand for other diagnostic testing;\n\u25cf the price we are able to receive for performing our testing services, and the length of time for which that demand persists;\n\u25cf the availability of COVID-19 testing from other laboratories;\n\u25cf the period of time for which our laboratories are able to serve as authorized laboratories offering COVID-19 testing under various Emergency Use Authorizations;\n\u25cf the ability of our laboratories to maintain status as authorized laboratories to perform COVID-19 and other diagnostic testing and related services and to respond to any changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the potential for supply disruptions and our reliance on certain single-source suppliers;\n\u25cf the potential for disruption in the delivery of patient samples to our laboratories;\n\u25cf the capacity of our laboratories to satisfy both COVID-19 testing and other testing demands;\n\u25cf the extent to which we choose to allocate limited laboratory capacity, supplies and other resources to areas of our business other than COVID-19 testing;\n\u25cf the complexity of billing for, and collecting revenue for, our testing services;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain laboratory operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and to perform the test accurately and punctually;\n\u25cf our ability to expand and or diversity our diagnostic services and\n\u25cf the ease of use of our ordering and reporting process.\nIn addition, the process of building and expanding our diagnostic services business may divert resources and distract management\u2019s attention from other areas of our business that may be more profitable or strategic. If we are unable to successfully provide diagnostic services while continuing to operate our existing manufacturing and dietary supplements business, our results of operations, financial position and reputation may suffer.\nIf demand for COVID-19 testing decreases or becomes no longer necessary and we are unable to generate sufficient profits from other RPP Molecular tests, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe launched our diagnostic service business in October 2020. Fluctuations in profits for our tests may occur due to of a variety of factors, including, among others, the amount and timing of sales of billable tests, the prices we charge for our tests due to changes in product, customer or payor mix, general price degradation for tests or other competitive factors, global health crises and pandemics, the rate and timing of our billings and collections and the timing and amount of our commitments and other payments, as well as the other risk factors discussed in this report. Our results have been, and may in the future be, impacted by events that may not recur regularly, in the same amounts or at all in the future. During Fiscal 2021, we saw a significant increase in our net revenues due to our substantial COVID-19 testing volumes during that time, particularly the first and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2021. The FDA has approved multiple COVID-19 vaccines for administration to the public. There can be no assurance that demand for our COVID-19 testing services will continue to exist in the future due to the widespread and effective vaccination of a majority of Americans against COVID-19 and successful containment efforts. If there is no demand for our COVID-19 testing services, and we are unable to generate sufficient profits from other RPP Molecular tests, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe recent growth and other fluctuations in our operating results may render period-to-period comparisons less meaningful, and investors should not rely on the results of any one period as an indicator of future performance. These fluctuations in our operating results could cause our performance in any particular period to fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have provided to the public, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock. Moreover, our limited operating history in diagnostic testing may make it difficult to determine if fluctuations in our performance reflect seasonality, pandemic-related demand or other trends or if these fluctuations are the result of other factors or events.\nOur ability to achieve or sustain profitability depends on our collection of payment for the tests we deliver, which we may not be able to do successfully.\nOur customer base for our COVID-19 tests is principally comprised of governmental bodies, municipalities, and large corporations who pay us directly or through third-party payors. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), was enacted, providing for reimbursement to healthcare providers for COVID-19 tests provided to uninsured individuals, subject to continued available funding. Approximately 59.5% of our revenue for Fiscal 2021 was generated from this program for the uninsured. On March 15, 2022, the Health Resources & Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d) announced that the uninsured program would stop accepting claims for COVID-19 testing and treatment as of March 22, 2022 at 11:59 PM ET due to lack of sufficient funds. In a letter dated March 15, 2022, the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the White House Coordinator for COVID-19 Response, sent a letter to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, in which they reiterated previous requests for additional emergency funding for the uninsured program and stated that the failure to provide funding could result in numerous negative consequences, particularly in light of the rising COVID-19 cases abroad. If emergency funding is not allocated to the HRSA uninsured program, our ability to collect payment from uninsured individuals in the future could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to generate revenue to replace the HRSA revenues from other sources.\nFurther, healthcare policy changes that influence the way healthcare is financed or other changes in the market that impact payment rates by institutional or non-institutional customers could also affect our collection rates. If we are unable to convince customers of the value and benefit provided by our tests, these customers may slow, or stop altogether, their purchases of these tests. Our collection risks also include the potential for default or bankruptcy by the party responsible for payment and other risks associated with payment collection generally. Any inability to maintain our past payment collection levels could cause our revenue and ability to achieve profitability to decline and adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nOur failure to manage our growth successfully could harm our growth and operating results.\nSince the sale of our Cold-EEZE\u2122 business in March 2017, we have been actively exploring new product technologies, applications, product line extensions and other new product and business opportunities. We experienced net losses from continuing operations before Fiscal 2020.\nIn October 2020, we purchased our first CLIA licensed laboratory in Old Bridge, New Jersey, where we offer a variety of important medical tests, including, among others, COVID-19 diagnostic testing and Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) Molecular tests. In December 2020, we expanded our diagnostic services to a second location in Garden City, New York. In August 2021, we acquired Nebula, a privately-owned personal genomics company. We intend to integrate Nebula\u2019s whole genome sequencing services with the clinical diagnostic services already offered at our CLIA-certified molecular testing laboratories. We may in the future consider and pursue investments and acquisitions in other sectors and industries.\nWe have and will continue to incur significant expenses as we grow these two new businesses. In order for us to be profitable, we must generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses. While we recognized net income from continuing operations before income tax for the first and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2021, we experienced a net loss in the second and third quarter of Fiscal 2021. There can be no assurance that our diagnostic services business or our personal genomics business will succeed or that we will be successful in initiating or acquiring any new lines of business in the future, or that any such new lines of business will achieve profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $45.8 million, which we believe is an acceptable and adequate level of working capital to support our business (including our two new business lines) for at least the next twelve months.\nThe loss of sales to any one or more of our large diagnostic services customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nIn Fiscal 2021, a significant portion of our revenues came from our diagnostic services business. In Fiscal 2021, three customers accounted for 23.5%, 17.9%, and 11.9% of our Fiscal 2021 revenues, respectively. The loss of sales to these diagnostic services customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition, unless we are able to increase revenue from other sources.\nOur business is subject to significant competitive pressures.\nOur principal competition for our lab diagnostic services are commercial laboratories, such as Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, both of which have significant infrastructures and resources to support their diagnostic processing services. In addition, we compete with large, multispecialty group medical clinics and health systems. Academic medical university-based clinics may also provide in-house clinical laboratories offering COVID-19 and other RPP Molecular tests. Additionally, we compete against regional clinical laboratories providing diagnostic services, including Interpace Biosciences, Inc. If we are unable to compete effectively, our earnings may be significantly negatively impacted.\nWe compete with other contract manufacturers of OTC drug and dietary supplement products. These suppliers range widely in size. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. Management believes that our manufacturing capacity and abilities offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the full-service contract development and manufacturing industry. We have over 20 years of manufacturing experience and industry know how in large scale batch production of OTC lozenge products. To the extent that any of our competitors are able to offer better prices, quality and/or services, however, we could lose customers and our sales and margins may decline.\nThe OTC healthcare products and dietary supplements industries are highly competitive. Many of the participants in these industries have substantially greater capital resources, technical staffs, facilities, marketing resources, product development, and distribution experience than we do. We believe that our ability to continue to compete in these industries will depend on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support. However, our failure to appropriately and timely respond to consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of products we develop and commercialize could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe number of companies entering the personal genomics market has increased in recent years. We face competition from other companies attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are, including those with existing diagnostic, laboratory services and other companies entering the personal genetics market with new offerings such as direct access and/or consumer self-pay tests and genetic interpretation services. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly or efficiently than we can to new or emerging technologies. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we will be able to achieve. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. This could attract customers away from our services and reduce our market share.\nPrior to our acquisition of Nebula, we had no specific experience operating a personal genomics business. Our success in this industry will depend, in large part, on our ability to establish our presence in the personal genetics market, provide customers with a high level of service at a competitive price, achieve sufficient sales volume to realize economies of scale, and create innovative new features, products, and services to offer to our customers. Our failure to achieve any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business.\nPrior to our acquisition of Nebula, we had no specific experience operating a personal genomics business. Our success in this industry will depend, in large part, on our ability to establish our presence in this market, provide customers with a high level of service at competitive prices, achieve sufficient sales volume to realize economies of scale, and create innovative new features, products and services to offer to our customers. If customers do not perceive our personal genomic reports to be reliable and of high quality, if we fail to introduce new and improved products and services, or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received by the market, we may not be able to attract or retain customers.\nThe growth and expansion of our business and service offerings will place a continuous strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will be required to manage multiple relationships with various strategic suppliers, customers and other third parties, including regulatory agencies. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train and manage our employee base. In the event of further growth of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our supply, systems, procedures or internal controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may not be able to manage any such growth effectively.\nIf our estimates of the total addressable market for personal genomic services and the potential for market growth prove to be inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be negatively affected.\nOur estimates and forecasts for the personal genomic service market are based on a number of complex assumptions, internal and third-party estimates, and other business data, including assumptions and estimates relating to our ability to leverage our diagnostic testing facilities to generate revenue from personal genomic services. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, there are inherent challenges in measuring or forecasting such information. As a result, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors and indicators. Consequently, our estimates of the total addressable market and our forecasts of market growth and future revenue from our products and services may prove to be incorrect. For example, if the annual total addressable market or the potential market growth for our products and services is smaller than we have estimated or if the key business metrics we utilize to forecast revenue are inaccurate, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMedia reports have in the past reported on consumer privacy concerns and the use of genetic information accessed from other genetic databases by law enforcement and governmental agencies. These reports may decrease the overall consumer demand for personal genetic products and services, including ours.\nCompanies offering personal genomic services and products have received a high degree of media coverage in recent years. Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our product and service offerings, including consumer privacy concerns related to any of our existing or future collaborations, could adversely affect our reputation, resulting in a negative impact on the size of our customer base, the loyalty of our customers, the percentage of our customers that consent to participate in any future research programs, and our ability to attract new customers.\nWe may require additional capital to support our growing diagnostic services business, personal genomics business, and product development and commercialization programs but additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to support our growing diagnostic services and personal genomics businesses, as well as our consumer product development and commercialization programs. The amount of capital that may be needed to support our businesses will depend on many factors which may include, but are not limited to (i) the revenue we generate from our diagnostic services, personal genomics products and services, contract manufacturing services and dietary supplement sales, (ii) the expenses we incur in growing our diagnostic services business and personal genomics business, and in marketing our manufacturing capabilities and dietary supplement line; (iii) the cost involved in applying for and obtaining FDA, international regulatory or other technical approvals, if required, and (iv) whether we elect to establish partnering or other strategic arrangements for the development, sales, manufacturing and marketing of our products and services.\nIncome from our diagnostic services business, personal genomics business, contract manufacturing business and TK Supplements\u00ae products line may not generate all the funds we need to support the growth of our diagnostic services and personal genomics businesses and future product development and commercialization. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may, in the short and long-term, seek to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities or through other financing sources. To the extent that we seek to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may include financial and other covenants that could restrict our use of the proceeds from such financing or impose other business and financial restrictions on us. In addition, we may consider alternative approaches such as licensing, joint venture, or partnership arrangements to provide long term capital. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions to our supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to our supply chain, including our access to raw materials necessary for our contract manufacturing business and TK Supplements\u00ae product line, access to COVID-19 testing supplies and personal protective equipment for our diagnostic services business, and materials and equipment (such as our saliva collections kits) necessary for our personal genomics business, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with most of our suppliers. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate supply for the delivery of our products and services, increases in demand for such items and services can result in shortages and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules. Further, we may experience shortages in certain items as a result of limited availability, increased demand, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, weather conditions and natural disasters, as well as other factors outside of our control.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, third parties that are critical to our businesses, including vendors, suppliers, and business partners. While our businesses have not been significantly impacted up to this point by the COVID-19 pandemic, given the unpredictability of the pandemic, it is difficult if not impossible to predict, whether that may change in the future.\nIncreases in the price of testing supplies, equipment and raw materials needed for our businesses and costs associated with doing business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase COVID-19 testing supplies and personal protective equipment for our diagnostic services business, and certain materials and equipment (such as our saliva collections kits) for our personal genomics business. We must also purchase certain key raw materials for our TK Supplements\u00ae products and the products we manufacture for third parties.\nIf the price of these testing supplies, equipment and raw materials were to increase significantly, we may not be able to pass on such increases to customers who use our services or purchase our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur freight costs may also increase due to factors such as limited carrier availability, increased fuel costs, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases and inflation. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our production and delivery costs. The prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our packaging material, freight, tariff and energy costs at the time they occur, or at all.\nThe adulteration of key diagnostic services testing materials and raw materials needed for our businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are reliant upon the supply of diagnostic services testing materials and raw materials that meet our specifications and the specifications of third parties for whom we manufacture. If any diagnostic services testing material or raw material is adulterated and does not meet our specifications or third parties\u2019 specifications, it could significantly impact our ability to perform diagnostic services or manufacture products and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose a significant or sole supplier our business and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCurrently, we rely on a sole supplier to manufacture our saliva collection kits used by customers who purchase our personal genomics services. Change in the supplier or design of certain of the materials that we rely on, in particular the saliva collection kit, could result in a requirement for additional premarket review from the FDA before making such a change.\nAny new laboratory or laboratories that are engaged to support our personal genomics business must first be validated in accordance with certain governmental standards before we are able to utilize their services for our U.S. customers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to secure alternative laboratory processing services, materials and equipment, and bring such alternative materials and equipment online and revalidate them without experiencing interruptions in our workflow, or that any alternative materials will meet our quality control and performance requirements of our current contracted laboratories that support our personal genomics business.\nDisruptions at our PMI manufacturing facilities or any loss of manufacturing certifications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and customer relationships.\nAny significant disruption at our manufacturing facility for any reason, including regulatory requirements, an FDA determination that the facility is not in compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations, the loss of certifications, power interruptions, destruction or damage to the facility or disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our ability to manufacture products for our contract manufacturing customers and any of our own branded products. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur PMI manufacturing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and may fluctuate from cold season to cold season.\nBecause the majority of sales from our PMI manufacturing facility are from cold remedy products, our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuations and influenced by the timing, length and severity of each cold season. Our revenues tend to be higher in the first, third and fourth quarters during the cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period of September to March, when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors.\nOur personal genomics business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nOur personal genomics kit sales are impacted by seasonal holiday demand. We expect to generate greater revenues from this business during the first quarter of our fiscal year, due to seasonal holiday demand and the fact that kits that are ordered during the holiday season (which occurs during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year) will generally be recognized as revenue when the customer sends in their kit to the laboratory to be processed and genetic reports are delivered to the customer, which for holiday purchases we expect will occur in the following fiscal quarter. Purchasing patterns of kit sales may also align with other gift-giving and family-oriented holidays such as Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day. This seasonality could cause our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter.\nWe may also experience an increase in lab processing times and costs associated with shipping orders due to freight surcharges due to peak capacity constraints and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. Such delays could lead to an inability to meet advertised estimated lab processing times, resulting in customer dissatisfaction or reputational damage. If too many customers access our website within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of kits sold. Also, third-party delivery and direct ship vendors may be unable to deliver merchandise on a timely basis.\nOur product development and commercialization efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThere are numerous risks associated with OTC product development and commercialization. We may be subject to delays and/or be unable to successfully implement our business plan and strategy to develop and commercialize one or more OTC products and/or dietary supplements. The successful commercialization and market acceptance of any products we develop will be subject to, among other things, consumer purchasing trends, health and wellness trends, regulatory factors, retail acceptance and overall economic and market conditions. As a consequence, we may suspend or abandon some or all of our proposed new products before they ever become commercially viable. Even if we successfully develop and obtain approval of a new product, if we cannot successfully commercialize it in a timely manner, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nAny significant disruption in service on our website, mobile applications, or in our computer or logistics systems, whether due to a failure with our information technology systems or that of a third-party vendor, could harm our reputation and may result in a loss of customers.\nCustomers purchase our personal genomics testing services and access Nebula offerings through our website or our mobile applications. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our and our partner websites, mobile applications, network infrastructure and content delivery processes. Interruptions to any of these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our or our partner websites or mobile applications, including our databases, and prevent our customers from accessing and using our services.\nOur systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, earthquake and similar events. In the event of any catastrophic failure involving our or our partner websites, we may be unable to serve our customer web traffic. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could result in damage to our systems or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such risks or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nAdditionally, our business model is dependent on our ability to deliver testing kits to customers and have kits processed and returned to us. This requires coordination between our logistics providers and third-party shipping services. Operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control such as hostilities, political unrest, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, pandemics and public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, affecting the geographies where our operations and customers are located. We may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions, particularly in the case of a catastrophic event. In addition, operational disruptions may occur during the holiday season, causing delays or failures in deliveries of PGS kits. Any such disruption may result in lost revenues, a loss of customers and reputational damage, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our products do not have the effects intended or cause undesirable side effects, our business may suffer.\nAlthough many of the ingredients in our current dietary supplement products are vitamins, minerals, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption, they also contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. While we believe that all of these products and the combinations of ingredients in them are safe when taken as directed, the products could have certain undesirable side effects if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer who has certain medical conditions. In addition, these products may not have the effect intended if they are not taken in accordance with certain instructions, which include certain dietary restrictions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of the products, even when used as directed, will have the effects intended or will not have harmful side effects in an unforeseen way or on an unforeseen cohort. If any of our products or products we develop or commercialize in the future are shown to be harmful or generate negative publicity from perceived harmful effects, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed significantly.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nAs a direct marketer and manufacturer of products designed for human consumption, we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products or the products that we manufacture for third parties are alleged to have resulted in injury or to include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. Our current products and the products that we currently manufacture for third parties are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States and could contain contaminated substances.\nWhile we currently maintain product liability insurance, a successful claim brought against us related to our branded products or products that we manufacture for third parties in excess of, or outside of, our existing insurance coverage, could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with customers, which could in turn materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will face legal, reputational, and financial risks if we fail to protect our customer data from security breaches or cyberattacks. Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information, genetic information, and other data relating to our customers, as well as other personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals such as our employees. Security breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 personal information. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our solutions and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could lead to significant fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nA security compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact that results in confidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, disruption of our business, and claims brought by our customers or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws. Breaches of health information and/or personal data may be extremely expensive to remediate, may prompt federal or state investigation, fines, civil and/or criminal sanctions and significant reputational damage. Monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and not covered by our liability insurance. Techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems evolve frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems and providing required breach notifications, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses. If we experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, and we could be subject to additional litigation, regulatory risks and business losses.\nOur failure, or the failure by our third-party providers on our platform, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise have occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing customers from using our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continued service of key personnel, such as Mr. Ted Karkus, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and certain managers and strategists within the Company. The loss of the services of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn order to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, marketing and health product positions. In particular, our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified health and science professionals. Competition for skilled employees who can perform the services that we require is intense and hiring, training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills required is time-consuming and expensive. If we are not able to hire sufficient professional staff to support our operations, or to train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we do hire, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results.\nFailure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could impact our business.\nWe will rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights in any products we develop and commercialize. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. From time to time, we may apply to have certain trademarks registered. There is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cSection 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (the \u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.\nBased on the Section 382 analysis, we do not believe our current net operating loss carryforwards are subject to these limitations as of December 31, 2021 with the exception of the net operating loss carryforwards from the Nebula acquisition, which are Section 382 limited.\nAdverse credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact the availability and cost of credit to us in the future. For example, the credit and financial markets may be adversely affected by the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and measures taken in response thereto. If the credit markets are not favorable, we may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash. Overall, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets.\nSystem failures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many companies, our business is highly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently our operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurate tracking of purchases and volume incentives and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrence of a natural disaster, security breach or other unanticipated problem could result in interruptions in our day-to-day operations that could adversely affect our business. A long-term failure or impairment of any of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Litigation\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our diagnostic service business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur diagnostic service operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among other things:\n\u25cf CLIA, which requires that laboratories obtain certification from the federal government, and state licensure laws;\n\u25cf CMS and FDA laws and regulations;\n\u25cf HIPAA, which imposes comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments to HIPAA under HITECH, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u25cf state laws regulating genetic testing and protecting the privacy of genetic test results, as well as state laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data and mandating reporting of breaches to affected individuals and state regulators;\n\u25cf the federal anti-kickback law, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program;\n\u25cf other federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufactures to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf Section 216 of the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires applicable laboratories to report private payor data in a timely and accurate manner beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (and in some cases annually);\n\u25cf state laws that impose reporting and other compliance-related requirements;\n\u25cf state billing laws, including regulations on \u201cpass through billing\u201d which may limit our ability to submit claims for payment and/or mark up the cost of services in excess of the price paid for such services, and \u201cdirect-bill\u201d laws which may limit our ability to purchase services from a laboratory and bill for the services ordered;\n\u25cf similar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. Our failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in state and federal health care programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our laboratory\u2019s ability to provide or receive payment for our services. Any action taken against us by a governmental entity or private party could, regardless of their outcome, damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations, and other private third-party payors.\nFailure to comply with government laws and regulations related to submission of claims for our services could result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and corresponding foreign reimbursement programs.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the submission of claims for payment for our services, such as those relating to: coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other state, federal and foreign health care programs; the amounts that we may bill for our services; and the party to which we must submit claims. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or in attempts by state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments already made. Submission of claims in violation of these laws and regulations can result in recoupment of payments already received, substantial civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from state and federal health care programs, and can subject us to liability under the federal False Claims Act and similar laws. The failure to report and return an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid program within 60 days of identifying its existence can give rise to liability under the False Claims Act. Further, a government agency could attempt to hold us liable for causing the improper submission of claims by another entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement at issue.\nBilling and collections processing for our tests is complex and time-consuming, and any delay in transmitting and collecting claims could have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nBilling for our tests is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we may bill various different parties for our tests. This includes billing customers directly, as in the case of our hospital and other medical institution customers, as well as billing through Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies and patients, all of which may have different billing requirements. We may face increased risk in our collection efforts due to the complexities of these billing requirements, including long collection cycles and lower collection rates, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral factors make this billing process complex, including:\n\u25cf contractual restrictions in our customer contracts that may limit our ability to utilize certain third-party billing service providers;\n\u25cf differences between the list price for our tests and the reimbursement rates of payors;\n\u25cf compliance with complex federal and state regulations related to billing government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf disputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u25cf differences in coverage among payors and the effect of patient co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u25cf differences in information and billing requirements among payors;\n\u25cf incorrect or missing billing information; and\n\u25cf the resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nWe have developed internal systems and procedures to handle these billing and collections functions, but we will need to make significant efforts and expend substantial resources to further develop our systems and procedures to handle these aspects of our business, which could become increasingly important as we focus on increasing test volumes and establishing coverage and reimbursement policies with third-party payors. As a result, these billing complexities, along with the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our tests, could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve or sustain profitability and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations. In addition, if claims for our tests are not submitted to payors on a timely basis, or if we are required to switch to a different provider to handle our processing and collections functions, our revenue and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur diagnostic services business could be harmed by the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), or those of Medicare, Medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the United States.\nThe performance of laboratory testing is subject to extensive U.S. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all physician practices performing clinical laboratory testing and to clinical laboratories operating in the United States by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or, in the case of clinical laboratories, by a federally approved accreditation agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. In addition, we expect to be subject to regulation under state law. State laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of diagnostic products could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties and could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, including COVID-19 diagnostics authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products.\nSince 2014, there have been ongoing discussions and advocacy between stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory industry, the FDA, and Congress, about potential FDA regulation of LDTs.\nIn March 2017, a draft bill on the regulation of LDTs, entitled \u201cThe Diagnostics Accuracy and Innovation Act\u201d (\u201cDAIA\u201d) was released for discussion. In December 2018, the sponsors of DAIA released a new version of the legislation called the \u201cVerifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act\u201d (\u201cVALID Act\u201d). The VALID Act proposes a risk-based approach to regulate LDTs and creates a new in vitro clinical test category, which includes LDTs, and a new regulatory structure under the FDA. Similar versions of the VALID Act have since been introduced. The most recent version was released in June 2021. As proposed, the bill would create a precertification program for lower risk tests not otherwise required to go through premarket review. It would grandfather existing tests but would allow the FDA to subject otherwise grandfathered tests to premarket review under certain conditions. Similarly, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories (\u201cVITAL\u201d) Act was introduced in December 2020 and re-introduced in May 2021. In contrast with the VALID Act, the VITAL Act would prevent FDA from regulating LDTs and would instead assign regulatory authority over LDTs entirely to CMS. We cannot predict whether either of these or other draft bills governing LDTs will become legislation and cannot quantify the effect of such draft bills on our business.\nWhile we cannot predict whether the either VALID Act or the VITAL Act as proposed, or any modified version of either act will be enacted into law, it is expected that some form of the acts will be incorporated into a broader health care legislative package. The likelihood that Congress will pass legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA\u2019s plans to regulate certain LDTs as medical devices is difficult to predict at this time. Until the VALID Act, VITAL Act, or other legislation is passed reforming the federal government\u2019s regulation of LDTs, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate our tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support any required clearance or approval.\nIn November 2020, the HHS advised that the FDA did not have authority to require LDTs related to COVID-19 to obtain an EUA prior to marketing. HHS also instructed the FDA to review voluntary EUA submissions of LDTs for COVID-19 in order to extend certain statutory immunities to liability for those laboratories under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. In November 2021, HHS rescinded its previous statement that the FDA did not have authority over LDTs. The FDA modified its policy and has required all COVID-19 related LDTs on the market to submit an EUA request within 60 days of the policy and has also made clear that no additional COVID-19 related LDTs may come onto the market prior to issuance of an EUA. FDA regulation of the diagnostic products we use and services we offer could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe use potentially hazardous materials, chemicals and patient samples in our business and any disputes relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur lab diagnostic services involve the controlled use of hazardous laboratory materials and chemicals, including small quantities of acid and alcohol, and patient samples. We are subject to U.S. laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste. We could be liable for accidental contamination or discharge or any resultant injury from hazardous materials, and conveyance, processing, and storage of and data on patient samples. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources. Further, future changes to environmental health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict operations.\nIn the event of a lawsuit or investigation concerning such hazardous materials, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous materials or patient samples that may contain infectious materials. The cost of this liability could exceed our resources. While we expect to maintain broad form liability insurance coverage for these risks, the level or breadth of our coverage may not be adequate to fully cover potential liability claims.\nFailure to accurately bill for testing services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government health care programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBilling for diagnostic services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, government groups, Medicare and Medicaid. For Fiscal 2021 the majority of our billing and related operations was provided by a third party. Effective November 2021, billing for diagnostic services is performed internally by our billing department. Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government health care programs may result in various consequences, including the return of overpayments, civil and criminal fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in government health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed. The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against health care companies on behalf of the government.\nAlthough we expect to be in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which services will be reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We expect that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived health care fraud. Legislative provisions relating to health care fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.\nOur contract manufacturing and dietary supplement businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation.\nOur contract manufacturing and dietary supplement businesses are subject to laws and regulations that cover:\n\u25cf the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products;\n\u25cf the health and safety of our products;\n\u25cf trade practice and direct selling laws; and\n\u25cf product claims and advertising.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is time consuming and expensive. Moreover, new regulations could be adopted that would severely restrict the products we sell or manufacture or our ability to continue our business. We are unable to predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These future changes could, however, require the reformulation or elimination of certain products; imposition of additional record keeping and documentation requirements; imposition of new federal reporting and application requirements; modified methods of importing, manufacturing, storing or distributing certain products; and expanded or different labeling and substantiation requirements for certain products and ingredients. Any or all of these requirements could harm our business.\nIn July 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients (\u201cNDIs\u201d) and in August 2016, the FDA issued revised draft guidance. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA\u2019s current views, including its position on enforcement. We believe that the draft guidance, if implemented as proposed, could have a material impact on our operations. FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively affect our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that those ingredients or products are in compliance, and the potential imposition of penalties for non-compliance.\nOur failure to comply with FTC regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against OTC drug companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nLaws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell our products in some markets or require us to make changes to our business model in some markets.\nDirect selling companies are subject to laws and regulations by various government agencies. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices and to protect consumers. The FTC periodically investigates and brings enforcement actions against direct selling companies based on alleged pyramid selling activity and/or false and misleading claims made by the direct selling company or its independent distributors. Direct selling companies that have been the subject of an FTC enforcement action have generally been required to make significant changes to their business model and pay significant monetary fines. Being the target of an investigation or enforcement action by the FTC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services critical to our diagnostic services business and personal genomic services business, and we depend on them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, any breaches of the information technology systems of third parties could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services critical to our diagnostic services business and personal genomic services business, including laboratory service providers and equipment suppliers, ground and air transport of clinical and diagnostic services supplies and specimens, research services (including ancestry report generation), and people, among other services. Third parties that provide services to us are subject to similar risks related to security of customer-related information and compliance with U.S., state, local, or international environmental, health and safety, and privacy and security laws and regulations as we are. Any failure by third parties to comply with applicable laws, or any failure of third parties to provide services more generally, could have a material impact on us, whether because of the loss of the ability to receive services from the third parties, our legal liability for the actions or inactions of third parties, or otherwise.\nIn addition, third parties to whom we outsource certain services or functions may process personal data, or other confidential information belonging to us. A breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe must comply with complex and overlapping laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data.\nThere are a number of state, federal and international laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data.\nUnder the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, HHS has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of PHI used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities.\nThe privacy regulations regulate the use and disclosure of PHI by health care providers engaging in certain electronic transactions or \u201cstandard transactions.\u201d They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA security regulations establish administrative, physical, and technical standards for maintaining the integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. These standards apply to covered health care providers and also to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d or third parties providing services involving the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI. As a result, we may be required to comply with both HIPAA privacy regulations and varying state privacy and security laws.\nMoreover, HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, a covered entity must notify each individual whose PHI is breached, federal regulators and in some cases, must publicize the breach in local or national media. Breaches affecting 500 individuals or more are publicized by federal regulators who publicly identify the breaching entity, the circumstances of the breach and the number of individuals affected.\nThese laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI. Given the complexity of HIPAA and HITECH and their overlap with state privacy and security laws, and the fact that these laws are rapidly evolving and are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. Adding to the complexity is that our planned operations are currently evolving, and the requirements of these laws will apply differently depending on such things as whether or not we bill electronically for our services or provide services involving the use or disclosure of PHI and incur compliance obligations as a business associate. The costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. Noncompliance could subject us to criminal penalties, civil sanctions and significant monetary penalties as well as reputational damage.\nWe are also required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees as well as receive and transfer certain payment information, to accept payments from our customers, including credit card information. Most states have adopted laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory contractual terms to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the United States implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements, and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. The collection and use of such information may be subject to contractual obligations as well. If the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third-party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws, regulations, and contractual obligations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nNumerous additional local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and effective as of January 1, 2020, the CCPA. These laws, rules, and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation. Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions. For example, the CPRA recently was approved by California voters and significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA does not become operative until January 1, 2023 (and then applies only to consumer data collected on or after January 1, 2022, (the \u201clookback period\u201d), with enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. While the CCPA will remain operative and enforceable from now until July 1, 2023, we will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, many laws and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data are subject to varying degrees of enforcement and new and changing interpretations by courts. The CCPA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, breach notifications, and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations, that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer, or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our platform, require significant changes to our operations, or even prevent us from providing our platform in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.\nIn the U.S., there have also been proposals for federal privacy legislation and many new state privacy laws proposed. In 2021, laws specific to genetic testing companies have passed in Utah, Arizona and Maryland, and legislation has been proposed in other states, including California.\nWe may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic government agencies or our customers pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our compliance with these regulations. Complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs, exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation, and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or obligations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock, Internal Controls and Governance Matters\nIf we are unable to remediate the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting or if additional material weaknesses are discovered in our internal accounting procedures, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the audit of our 2021 consolidated financial statements, our management and independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our controls relating to our lack of appropriate standard operating procedures and billing system controls associated with diagnostic billing process and the lack of contemporaneous assessments and associated documentation of the reimbursement receivables leading to additional allowance requirements. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. In addition, investors relying upon this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or to stockholder class action securities litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that measures being taken in order to remediate the material weakness described above will fully remediate such material weakness. We also cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing control deficiencies or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in future offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur, could adversely affect the prevailing trading prices of our common stock. Moreover, the perceived risk of potential dilution could cause stockholders to attempt to sell their shares and investors to \u201cshort\u201d our stock, a practice in which an investor sells shares that he or she does not own at prevailing market prices, hoping to purchase shares later at a lower price to cover the sale. All of these events could combine to make it difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, products or stock performance, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, the unpredictability of our financial results likely reduces the certainty, and therefore reliability, of the forecasts by securities or industry analysts of our future financial results, adding to the potential volatility of our stock price.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors owns a substantial amount of our common stock.\nAs of March 25, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 28.2% of our common stock. As such, our Chief Executive Officer may exert significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. Consequently, he exercises substantial influence over major decisions including major corporate actions such as mergers and other business combinations transactions which could result in or prevent a change of control of the Company. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of our Chief Executive Officer could be in conflict with the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, a stockholder\u2019s ability to influence us through voting their shares may be limited.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions that may be barriers to a takeover.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain provisions which may deter, discourage, or make it difficult for another person or entity to gain control of the Company through a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or similar transaction or series of transactions, including provisions that:\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, which may provide for voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u25cf specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our chairman or the board of directors;\n\u25cf prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u25cf establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder matters to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u25cf expressly authorized our board of directors to make, alter, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions may deter a future tender offer or other takeover attempt which could include a premium over the market price of our common stock at the time. Such provisions could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, executive officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nAlthough the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, executive officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, executive officers, and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors from liability.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any person who is or was made a party to, or is or was threatened to be made a party to, any pending, completed, or threatened action, suit or proceeding because he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the Company\u2019s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. These provisions permit us to advance expenses to an indemnified party in connection with defending any such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by the indemnified party to repay those amounts if it is later determined that the party is not entitled to indemnification. We entered into indemnity agreements with each member of our board of directors. These agreements provide, among other things, that we will indemnify each officer and director in the event they become a party or otherwise a participant in any action or proceeding on account of their service as a director or officer of the Company (or service for another corporation or entity in any capacity at the request of the Company) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The indemnification provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and discourage or deter stockholders from suing directors or officers for breaches of their duties to the Company, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company or its stockholders. In addition, to the extent that we expend funds to indemnify directors and officers, funds will be unavailable for operational purposes.", "PERMNO": 85205, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PRPH"}
