Risk Factors\nOur future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control. The following issues, uncertainties, and risks, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook.\nOur business is subject to general economic, business, and regulatory factors affecting the truckload industry that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors include:\n\u00b7\nexcess tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry in comparison with shipping demand;\n\u00b7\ndeclines in the resale value of used equipment;\n\u00b7\nstrikes, work stoppages, or work slowdowns at our facilities or at customer, port, border crossing, or other shipping-related facilities;\n\u00b7\nincreases in interest rates, fuel taxes, tolls, and license and registration fees;\n\u00b7\nrising costs of healthcare; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nWe are also affected by (i) recessionary economic cycles, such as the period from 2007 through 2009, and the 2016 freight environment, currently characterized by weak demand and pressure on rates; (ii) changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels and in the availability of funding for their working capital; and (iii) downturns in our customers\u2019 business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries, such as retail and manufacturing, where we have significant customer concentration, and regions of the country, such as Texas and the Midwest, where we have a significant amount of business. Economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their demand for and ability to pay for our services. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. These economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nEconomic conditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of available tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times, which risks we experienced during prior recessionary periods, are as follows:\n\u00b7\nwe may experience low overall freight levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\u00b7\ncertain of our customers may face credit issues and cash flow problems that may lead to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships that could result in even lower freight demand and may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u00b7\nfreight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and our customers\u2019 freight demand;\n\u00b7\ncustomers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs, and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight;\n\u00b7\nwe may be forced to accept more loads from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or may be forced to incur more non-revenue generating miles to obtain loads; and\n\u00b7\nlack of access to current sources of credit or lack of lender access to capital, leading to an inability to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWe are also subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel prices, driver and office employee wages, purchased transportation costs, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance, revenue equipment and related maintenance, tires and other components, and healthcare and other benefits for our employees. Further, we may not be able to appropriately adjust our costs to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs.\nIn addition, we cannot predict future economic conditions, consumer confidence, the economic impact of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures could lead to reduced economic demand, reduced availability of credit, increased prices for fuel, or temporary closing of shipping locations or U.S. borders. Such events or enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nChanging impacts of regulatory measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity, decrease our revenues and profitability, and result in higher operating costs. In addition, declines in the resale value of revenue equipment can also affect our profitability and cash flows. From time to time, various U.S. federal, state, or local taxes are also increased, including taxes on fuels. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such increase applicable to us will be enacted, but such an increase could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to improve our profitability and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNumerous competitive factors present in our industry could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nWe compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, and other transportation and logistics companies, many of which have access to more equipment and greater capital resources than we do.\n\u00b7\nMany of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business.\n\u00b7\nMany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \"core carriers\" as approved service providers or by engaging dedicated providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.\n\u00b7\nMany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors.\n\u00b7\nThe trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.\n\u00b7\nThe market for qualified drivers is increasingly competitive, and our inability to attract and retain drivers could reduce our equipment utilization or cause us to increase compensation, both of which would adversely affect our profitability.\n\u00b7\nCompetition from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates.\n\u00b7\nEconomies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us.\n\u00b7\nSome of our smaller competitors may not yet be fully compliant with pending regulations, such as regulations requiring the use of ELDs, which may allow such competitors to take advantage of additional driver productivity.\n\u00b7\nSome of our customers are other transportation companies or also operate their own private trucking fleets, and they may decide to transport more of their own freight.\n\u00b7\nAdvances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments.\n\u00b7\nHigher fuel prices and, in turn, higher fuel surcharges to our customers may cause some of our customers to consider freight transportation alternatives, including rail transportation.\nIncreases in driver compensation or difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and the ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nLike many truckload carriers, we experience substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, which includes the engagement of independent contractors. Our industry periodically experiences a shortage of qualified drivers, particularly during periods of economic expansion, in which alternative employment opportunities are more plentiful and freight demand increases, or during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing is limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment, or for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Regulatory requirements, including those related to safety ratings, ELDs and HOS changes, and an improved economy could further reduce the number of eligible drivers or force us to increase driver compensation to attract and retain drivers. We have seen evidence that stricter HOS regulations adopted by the DOT have tightened, and may continue to tighten, the market for eligible drivers. The shortage of qualified drivers and intense competition for drivers from other trucking companies will create difficulties in maintaining or increasing the number of our drivers and may restrain our ability to engage a sufficient number of drivers and independent contractors, and our inability to do so may negatively impact our operations. Further, the compensation we offer our drivers and independent contractor expenses is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver compensation and/or become subject to increased independent contractor expenses in future periods. In addition, we and many other truckload carriers suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers and independent contractors. This high turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers and independent contractors and to focus on alternative recruitment methods in order to operate existing revenue equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers and independent contractors, including through our driver school, we could be forced to, among other things, adjust our compensation packages, increase the number of our tractors without drivers, or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nOur engagement of independent contractors to provide a portion of our capacity exposes us to different risks than we face with our tractors driven by company drivers.\nPursuant to our fuel surcharge program with independent contractors, we pay independent contractors we contract with a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause our costs under this program to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs.\nThe independent contractor agreements with the independent contractors we engage are governed by the federal leasing regulations, which impose specific requirements on us and the independent contractors. If more stringent federal leasing regulations are adopted, independent contractors could be deterred from becoming independent contractor drivers, which could materially adversely affect our goal of maintaining our current fleet levels of independent contractors.\nIndependent contractors are third-party service providers, as compared with company drivers, who are employed by us. As independent business owners, they may make business or personal decisions that may conflict with our best interests. For example, if a load is unprofitable, route distance is too far from home, personal scheduling conflicts arise, or for other reasons, independent contractors may deny loads of freight from time to time. In these circumstances, we must be able to deliver the freight timely in order to maintain relationships with customers, and if we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, there could be a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTax and regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees, rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers\u2019 compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to (i) abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, (ii) extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and (iii) impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If independent contractors we contract with are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nDevelopments in labor and employment law and any unionizing efforts by employees could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face the risk that Congress, federal agencies, or one or more states could approve legislation or regulations significantly affecting our businesses and our relationship with our employees. None of our domestic employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, but any attempt by our employees to organize a labor union could result in increased legal and other associated costs. Additionally, given the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s new \u201cspeedy election\u201d rule, our ability to timely and effectively address any unionizing efforts would be difficult. If we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our domestic employees, the terms could materially adversely affect our costs, efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations.\nAdditionally, the Department of Labor recently issued a final rule raising the minimum salary basis for executive, administrative and professional exemptions from overtime payment. The rule increases the minimum salary from the current amount of $23,660 to $47,476 and non-discretionary bonus, commission and other incentive payments can be counted towards the minimum salary requirement. The rule goes into effect on December 1, 2016. These changes could impact the way we classify certain positions and increase our payment of overtime wages, which may have a materially adverse impact on our financial and operational results.\nOngoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings.\nOur business results in a substantial number of claims and litigation related to personal injuries, property damage, workers\u2019 compensation, employment issues, health care, and other issues. We self-insure a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings, and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Our future insurance and claims expenses may exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We currently accrue amounts for liabilities based on our assessment of claims that arise and our insurance coverage for the periods in which the claims arise and we evaluate and revise these accruals from time-to-time based on additional information. Due to our high self-insured amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and the risk of being required to accrue or pay additional amounts if our estimates are revised or the claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed.\nWe maintain insurance for most risks above the amounts for which we self-insure. If any claim were to exceed our coverage, or fall outside the aggregate coverage limit, we would bear the excess or uncovered amount, in addition to our other self-insured amounts. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits are sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed those limits. If insurance carriers raise our premiums, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. Should these expenses increase, we are unable to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage, or we have to increase our reserves, there could be a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers. For fiscal 2016, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 17.9% of our revenue. We do not expect this percentage to change materially for fiscal 2017. Generally, we do not have long-term contractual relationships with our major customers, and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will continue to use our services or that they will continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur revenue growth may not continue at historical rates, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur revenue growth over the past five years has been attributable to an improving economic and freight pricing environment, acquisitions, and expansions of our suite of services. Economic weakness, a failure to consummate acquisitions, disposing of a business line, or failure to attract and retain sufficient drivers could lead to a reduction in our revenue growth or lower revenue. Slower revenue growth could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various U.S., Canadian, and Mexican agencies. Our drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT and FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and HOS. Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to U.S. and Canadian regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel consumption, engine emissions, drivers\u2019 HOS, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the EPA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Food and Drug Administration also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices could adversely affect our results of operations. The Regulation section in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses several proposed, pending, suspended, and final regulations that could materially impact our business and operations.\nThe DOT\u2019s CSA program could adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, and our customer relationships.\nUnder CSA, fleets are evaluated and ranked against their peers based on certain safety-related standards. As a result, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to peer carriers. We recruit and retain first-time drivers to be part of our fleet, and these drivers may have a higher likelihood of creating adverse safety events under CSA. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruitment by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers or limit the pool of drivers we are comfortable hiring or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, competition for drivers with favorable safety backgrounds may increase and thus could necessitate increases in driver-related compensation costs. Further, we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores.\nWe have exceeded the established intervention thresholds in a number of the seven CSA safety-related categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We have put procedures in place in an attempt to address areas where we have exceeded the thresholds. However, we cannot assure that these measures will be effective.\nReceipt of an unfavorable DOT safety rating could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe currently have a satisfactory DOT rating, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations as customer contracts may require a satisfactory DOT safety rating, and a conditional or unsatisfactory rating could materially adversely affect or restrict our operations.\nThe FMCSA has proposed regulations that would modify the existing rating system and the safety labels assigned to motor carriers evaluated by the DOT. Under the proposed regulations, the methodology for determining a carrier\u2019s DOT safety rating would be expanded to include the on-road safety performance of the carrier\u2019s drivers and equipment, as well as results obtained from investigations. Exceeding certain thresholds based on such performance or results would cause a carrier to receive an unfit safety rating. If these proposed regulations are enacted and we were to receive an unfit safety rating, our business would be materially adversely affected in the same manner as if we received a conditional or unsatisfactory safety rating under the current regulations.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future or, if we do, we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy.\nWe have pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years, having made thirty-six acquisitions since 1995, and five since the beginning of fiscal 2015. Accordingly, acquisitions have provided a substantial portion of our growth. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. If we fail to make any future acquisitions, our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows;\n\u00b7\ndilutive issuance of equity securities and/or incurring indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of liabilities, including undisclosed liabilities and liabilities that exceed our estimates;\n\u00b7\ninability to negotiate effective indemnification protection from the seller, or inability to collect in the event of an indemnity claim;\n\u00b7\nproblems integrating the purchased operations with our own, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u00b7\npotential compliance issues with regard to acquired companies that did not have adequate internal controls;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with entering markets or business lines in which we have had no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7\nincreases in working capital and capital expenditure investment to fund the growth of acquired operations;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of customers, key employees, drivers, and independent contractors of the acquired company; and\n\u00b7\nfuture write-offs of intangible and other assets if the acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, there is no assurance that operations, assets, and personnel of the acquired operations will be successfully and profitably integrated into our existing business.\nGoodwill impairments and impairments of long-lived assets could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have substantial goodwill and long-lived assets, which primarily relate to goodwill from acquisitions and revenue equipment. We evaluate goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the accounting policies discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We have not been required to record an impairment charge with respect to our goodwill within the past three years. However, in the future, the fair value of certain long-lived assets may decrease below their carrying amount and future goodwill impairments that may be material could be recognized. Any declines resulting in a goodwill impairment or long-lived asset impairment may result in material non-cash charges to our earnings. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated stockholders' equity and increase our debt-to-total capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our results of operations and access to the public debt and equity markets.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms.\nThe trucking industry is capital intensive, and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually. If we elect to expand our fleet in future periods, our capital needs would increase. We expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with a combination of capital and operating leases, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our line of credit. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel, the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments, surcharge collection, and hedging activities may increase our costs of operation, which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nFuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, commodity futures trading, devaluation of the dollar against other currencies, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters, each of which may lead to an increase in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices also are affected by the rising demand for fuel in developing countries, including China, and could be materially adversely affected by the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production and by diminished drilling activity. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, significant diesel fuel cost increases, shortages, or supply disruptions would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel also is subject to regional pricing differences and is often more expensive on the West Coast of the United States, where we have operations. Increases in fuel costs, to the extent not offset by rate per mile increases or fuel surcharges, have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability. While we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers, which historically have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of rising fuel prices associated with loaded or billed miles, we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs, such as those associated with non-revenue generating miles or time when our engines are idling, or fuel for our refrigeration units on our refrigerated trailers. Moreover, the terms of each customer\u2019s fuel surcharge program vary, and certain customers have sought to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge programs to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. In addition, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. This could lead to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement, which have occurred in the past. There can be no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective.\nFrom time to time, we use hedging contracts and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations. We may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements. Our hedging arrangements effectively allow us to pay a fixed rate for fuel that is determined based on the market rate at the time we enter into the hedge. In times of falling diesel fuel prices, such as recently, our costs will not be reduced to the same extent they would have reduced if we had not entered into the hedging contracts and we may incur significant expense in connection with our obligation to make cash payments under such contracts. Accordingly, in times of falling diesel fuel prices, our profitability and cash flows may be materially adversely affected to a greater extent than if we had not entered into the hedging contracts.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with doing business internationally, our revenues and profitability may suffer.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations, and our success is dependent upon our operations in Mexico and Canada. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of the foreign countries in which we do business, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, compliance burdens associated with a wide variety of international and United States export and import laws, and social, political, and economic instability. Our international business could be adversely affected by restrictions on travel to any of our three countries of operations due to a health epidemic or outbreak, and any such epidemic or outbreak may adversely affect demand for freight. Additional risks associated with our foreign operations include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties by foreign governments, and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance. Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Mexico, cross-border movements for both United States and Mexican-based carriers into the United States and Mexico are now allowed, which presents an additional risk in the form of the potential for increased competition in Mexico and the risk of increased congestion on our cross-border lanes. In addition, we could be subject to additional regulatory risks related to the use of Mexican drivers through our Mexico subsidiary for shipments into the United States.\nIncreased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, volatility in the used equipment market, decreased availability of new revenue equipment, and the failure of manufacturers to meet their sale or trade-back obligations to us could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and profitability.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors. We have experienced an increase in prices for new tractors over the past few years, and the resale value of the tractors has not increased to the same extent. Prices have increased and may continue to increase, due, in part, to government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines, higher commodity prices, and due to the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers. More restrictive EPA emissions standards have required vendors to introduce new engines. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, result in lower fuel mileage, and increase our operating expenses. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors and trailers for these or other reasons. As a result, we expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses and related financing costs for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, reduced equipment efficiency and lower fuel mileage may result from new engines designed to reduce emissions, thereby increasing our operating expenses.\nAs we continually replace our equipment and occasionally seek to dispose of outdated equipment obtained through our acquisitions, we rely on the used equipment market to extract remaining value out of our used equipment. The market for used equipment is impacted by several factors, including the demand for freight, the supply of used equipment, the availability of financing, the presence of buyers for export to foreign countries, and commodity prices for scrap metal. A depressed market for used equipment could require us to trade our revenue equipment at depressed values or to record losses on disposal or impairments of the carrying values of our revenue equipment that is not protected by residual value arrangements. If there is a deterioration of resale prices, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Trades at depressed values, decrease in proceeds for equipment disposals, and impairments of the carrying values of our revenue equipment could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A deterioration of demand for used equipment could make it more difficult to dispose of and replace older equipment and may reduce our ability to refresh our fleet and dispose of less fuel efficient equipment obtained through acquisitions, both of which could negatively impact our profitability.\nTractor and trailer vendors may reduce their manufacturing output in response to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or shortages of component parts. A decrease in vendor output may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to purchase a quantity of new revenue equipment that is sufficient to sustain our desired growth rate and to maintain a late-model fleet. Moreover, an inability to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompliance with various environmental laws and regulations upon which our operations are subject may increase our costs of operations and non-compliance with such laws and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn addition to direct regulation under the DOT and related agencies, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, and discharge and retention of storm water. Our truck terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. A small percentage of our freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects us to an additional array of regulations. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nEPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions became more restrictive in 2010 when an executive memorandum was signed directing the NHTSA and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks. In 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA adopted final rules that established the Phase 1 Standards. The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018, which are required to achieve an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by 2018, and equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles travelled. In addition, in August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA adopted the Phase 2 Standards that will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. We believe these requirements will result in additional increases in new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs incurred to retrofit our tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect our operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. In addition, future additional emission regulations are possible. Any such regulations that impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results; however, any future regulation could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of certain key employees, including, but not limited to: Paul Will, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; William E. Meek, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bobby Peavler, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of their services could negatively impact our operations and future profitability.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events affect our operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, and higher equipment expenditures. We may also suffer from weather-related or other unforeseen events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nOur business is subject to certain credit factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control and that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf the economy and/or the credit markets weaken, or we are unable to enter into capital or operating leases to acquire revenue equipment on terms favorable to us, our business, financial results, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. We may need to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund working capital requirements, make investments, or for general corporate purposes. If the credit and equity markets erode, our ability to do so may be constrained. A decline in the credit or equity markets or any increase in volatility could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing and may lead to an adverse impact on our profitability and operations.\nOur primary credit agreement contains certain covenants, restrictions, and requirements, and we may be unable to comply with the covenants, restrictions, and requirements. A default could result in the acceleration of all or part of our outstanding indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and the price of our common stock.\nWe have financing arrangements that contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, affiliate transactions, and financial covenants. If we fail to comply with any of our financing arrangement covenants, restrictions, and requirements, we will be in default under the relevant agreement, which could cause the acceleration of our obligations under such agreement. Deterioration in the credit markets may make it difficult or expensive to refinance accelerated debt or we may have to issue equity securities, which would dilute stock ownership. Even if new financing is made available to us, the current lack of available credit and consequent more stringent borrowing terms may mean that credit is not available to us on acceptable terms. A default under our financing arrangements could cause a materially adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. See the Primary Credit Agreement section in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our primary credit agreement.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and our ongoing capital needs are extensive. Our indebtedness could result in the following consequences:\n\u00b7\nincreased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nincreased vulnerability to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt;\n\u00b7\ncommitment of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems and a system failure could cause a significant disruption to our business and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including financial reporting and operating systems, in operating our business. Our operating system is critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching equipment and drivers, and billing and collecting for our services. Our financial reporting system is critical to producing accurate and timely financial statements and analyzing business information to help us manage effectively. If any of our critical information systems fail or become otherwise unavailable, whether as a result of the upgrade project or otherwise, we would have to perform the functions manually, which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, to respond to customers' requests effectively, to maintain billing and other records reliably, and to bill for services and prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. Our business interruption insurance may be inadequate to protect us in the event of an unforeseeable and extreme catastrophe. Any system failure, delays, or complications, security breach, or other system failure could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, or impact our ability to manage our operations and report our financial performance, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Quality and its Financing Arrangements\nThe rapid growth of Quality during 2015 and our reliance on financing arrangements with 19th Capital Group, LLC and our third party financing provider pose unique risks.\nQuality offers \"tractors under management\" to independent contractors, motor carrier fleets, and financing sources. Quality\u2019s services include tractor leasing, driver recruiting, lease payment remittance, insurance, maintenance, and other services. A portion of the tractors under management are contracted to independent contractors in our fleet. The remaining tractors are contracted to other fleets and their drivers. Quality\u2019s business has grown rapidly, from 750 tractors under management at June 30, 2013, to 11,300 tractors under management at June 30, 2016, but the rate of growth has slowed during 2016 and is expected to remain constrained in the near future due to lower amounts of purchases by our funding sources and lower market demand.\nSince March of 2014, Quality has placed the majority of its tractors under management through our program agreement and service agreement (each as amended and restated from time to time) with our third party financing provider. In September 2015 we entered into a similar arrangement with 19th Capital (together with our third party financing provider, the \"Quality Financing Parties\"). The 19th Capital arrangement differs from the arrangement with our third party financing provider in that we hold a minority equity interest in 19th Capital and, as a result, indirectly participate in the economics of 19th Capital's operations, whereas we do not hold any equity in our third party financing provider.\nPursuant to these agreements, we have used our volume purchasing power to purchase tractors, place them under lease and then sell them to the Quality Financing Parties. Quality then refers independent contractor drivers or fleets to the Quality Financing Parties, who lease tractors to such independent contractors or fleets or finance the drivers\u2019 purchase of tractors. Each Quality Financing Party has credit profile, customer concentration, and other business goals and restrictions, and may not grow, be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or even continue to finance tractors. In addition, approximately $99.1 million of Quality's tractors under management are held on our consolidated balance sheet under \"leased assets.\"\nRecently, the demand for trucking services and the market for used tractors have both weakened. This has negatively impacted Quality's operating results by reducing the amount of leased equipment sold by Quality to the Quality Financing Parties and resulting in a higher than expected number of unseated tractors among Quality's tractors under management. These factors have depressed Quality's earnings and created negative cash flows associated with our obligation to advance certain amounts to the third party financing provider under the Lease Shortfall Advance. See \"Risk Factors -- We are obligated to make certain payments to our third party financing provider that could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\"\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere, Quality\u2019s operations and these arrangements pose the following risks:\n\u00b7\nIn general, Quality\u2019s tractor purchase orders do not become \"firm commitment\" orders for which we are irrevocably obligated until shortly before purchase. However, failure to consummate these orders could have a materially adverse effect on Quality\u2019s growth prospects. Quality may be unsuccessful in locating or reaching agreeable terms with third parties to purchase tractors from us in a volume that is adequate to meet Quality\u2019s current or anticipated operations. Currently Quality does not have any orders for delivery.\n\u00b7\nIf a change in accounting rules or other unforeseen circumstances prevents us from using our intended accounting treatment for the Quality Financing Party arrangements or similar arrangements, we may be required to include the related equipment debt on our consolidated balance sheet even though we are not primarily obligated on and do not guarantee such debt. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.\n\u00b7\nPursuant to our arrangement with the Quality Financing Parties, under certain circumstances we may be required to take certain actions to recover the vehicle, find a new driver, repair the vehicle, prepare it for service, or provide other support. To the extent that these costs are not covered by the reserve account, amounts which are prefunded by our third party financing provider or 19th Capital at the date of the transaction, we may be required to fund these costs and collect reimbursement from Quality\u2019s Financing Parties. We also may be required to repurchase certain leases or financings from the Quality Financing Parties upon Quality\u2019s uncured material breach of the respective agreements. It may be difficult to recoup the costs associated with these actions, which depends on many factors including the condition of the used equipment market.\n\u00b7\nWe may experience commercial pressure from financing sources and suppliers to provide additional services, change the terms of services provided, or otherwise help them mitigate any losses they may suffer, even if we are not legally obligated to do so.\n\u00b7\nWe may experience commercial pressure from the Quality Financing Parties or other third parties with whom we enter into similar arrangements to add additional driver recruiting, truck maintenance and repossession, or other services, or change the terms of such services, any of which could increase our costs.\nThis risk is expected to be mitigated if the transactions contemplated by the MOU are completed. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quality Memorandum of Understanding.\"\nWe are obligated to advance certain payments to our third party financing provider that could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nUnder our Third Amended and Restated Service Agreement and related agreements with our third party financing provider, we are responsible for servicing the equipment lease and other financing arrangements between independent contractor drivers and the third party financing provider, which includes collecting payments from the independent contractors and remitting those payments to the financing provider. This agreement includes an arrangement under which we are generally obligated to advance to our third party financing provider any shortfall between the required lease payments and the maintenance advances and amounts actually collected from the independent contractors. Our third party financing provider is generally obligated to reimburse us for this shortfall (or the applicable portion) when they dispose of the entire tranche of tractors to which the shortfall (or applicable portion) relates. We refer to these advances herein as \"Lease Shortfall Advances\" and to this arrangement as our \"Lease Shortfall Advance\" arrangement.\nThe Lease Shortfall Advances, along with certain sale shortfall and other amounts, initially were subject to satisfaction from a reserve fund that amounted to approximately $74 million. This fund has been exhausted. We are required to fund the Lease Shortfall Advances directly after the fund is exhausted. As of June 30, 2016, we have advanced approximately $31.9 million to our third party financing provider under the Lease Shortfall Advances. This amount is expected to grow during fiscal 2017 if the transactions contemplated by the MOU are not completed. The actual amount could vary significantly based on collections and tractor utilization and could be substantial.\nOur third party financing provider is required to reimburse us for the Lease Shortfall Advances and, accordingly, we have accounted for the related receivable under \"other assets\" on our consolidated balance sheet, in the amount of $31.9 million as of June 30, 2016, which is partially offset by approximately $6.6 million of subsequent collections from independent contractors and fleets that we are required to turn over to the third party financing provider. The amount of this receivable will grow to the extent we are obligated to make additional Lease Shortfall Advances. However, the timing of repayment on this receivable is substantially subject to the control of our third party financing provider, as the receivable is repaid when the entire applicable tranche of equipment is sold. The condition of the used equipment market may not be favorable for our third party financing provider to sell equipment at attractive prices. In addition, repayment of the Lease Shortfall Advance receivable may be delayed if a tranche of tractors has not been fully disposed. Moreover, we cannot assure you that this amount will be collected when due or be subject to defenses to repayment. Accordingly, we may not recover the Lease Shortfall Advance receivable, and we may be required to write down the book value of this receivable.\nThis risk is expected to be mitigated if the transactions contemplated by the MOU are completed. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quality Memorandum of Understanding.\"\n19th Capital faces certain additional risks particular to its operations, any one of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we acquired a minority interest in 19th Capital, a newly formed used equipment leasing company and reseller. We account for our investment in 19th Capital using the equity method of accounting. 19th Capital faces several risks similar to those we face and additional risks particular to its business and operations. The ability to secure financing and market fluctuations in interest rates could impact 19th Capital's ability to grow its leasing and financing business and its margins on leases and financing. Adverse economic activity may restrict the number of used equipment buyers, their ability to pay acceptable prices for used equipment, and create financing defaults, bankruptcies, and difficulties recovering equipment. In addition, 19th Capital's customers are typically small trucking companies or independent contractors without substantial financial resources, and 19th Capital is subject to risk of loss should those customers be unable to make their lease payments.\nIf a lessee or other counterparty fails to maintain the equipment in accordance with the terms of the financing agreements, 19th Capital may have unanticipated repair expenditures. As regulations change, the market for used equipment may be impacted as such regulatory changes may make used equipment costly to upgrade to comply with such regulations or 19th Capital may be forced to scrap equipment if such regulations eliminate the market for particular used equipment. Further, there is an overlap in providers of equipment financing to 19th Capital and our wholly owned operations and those providers may consider the combined exposure and limit the amount of credit available to us. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely impact the value of and our return on our investment in 19th Capital, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIn addition, while certain of our executive officers serve as two of the managers of 19th Capital, we do not control 19th Capital's ownership or management. Our investment in 19th Capital is subject to the risk that 19th Capital's management and controlling members may make business, financial, or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the management or controlling members may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the value of our investment in 19th Capital could decrease, and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow could suffer as a result.\nFinally, we expect that, for federal income tax purposes, 19th Capital will be treated as the owner and lessor of the equipment that it leases to third parties. However, the IRS could instead assert that such leases are sales or financings. If it were determined that 19th Capital is not the owner of the leased equipment, 19th Capital would not be entitled to cost recovery, depreciation or amortization deductions, and its leasing income might be deemed to be portfolio income instead of passive activity income. The denial of such cost recovery or amortization deductions could cause its tax liabilities to increase, and therefore the amount of cash available for distribution to us to decrease, in certain periods.\nThis risk factor will become outdated and different risks will apply if the transactions contemplated by the MOU are completed.\n19th Capital's grant of profits interests to certain of our officers and employees may cause conflicts of interest.\nAs part of our formation and minority investment in 19th Capital, certain of our officers and employees were granted profits interests in 19th Capital. These individuals' economic interests as holders of 19th Capital's profits interests may not always align with the interests of our stockholders. In particular, the profits interests may create economic incentives to devote time, energy, and resources to 19th Capital that may not necessarily benefit us or our stockholders to the same extent as efforts devoted directly to us, or at all. These conflicts of interest, or even the perception that they exist, may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. If the joint venture contemplated by the MOU is consummated, these profits interests are expected to be eliminated, although the terms of any such elimination have not been negotiated.", "PERMNO": 80113, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "CGIPQ"}
