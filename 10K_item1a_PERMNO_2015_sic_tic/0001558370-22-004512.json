{"cik": "821002", "company": "G III APPAREL GROUP LTD /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our operating results, our financial condition, the trading prices of our securities and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic (including federal, state and local governmental responses, broad economic impacts and market disruptions) has heightened risks discussed in the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and the current and uncertain future outlook of the outbreak may continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA novel strain of coronavirus, commonly referred to as COVID-19, spread rapidly across the globe beginning in December 2019, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business and global supply chain disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such actions, among others, resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty, companies across a wide array of industries implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work furloughs and reduced pay, which could lower consumers\u2019 disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items such as apparel. Most operating restrictions on our stores were lifted during fiscal 2022, although customer traffic continued to be reduced compared to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, there were periodic incidents of a resurgence in the number of cases of COVID-19 and its variants in the U.S. and certain other parts of the world, which caused business disruptions for us and/or our wholesale customers, suppliers and vendors. Even as government restrictions and company initiatives have been lifted or significantly reduced, consumer behavior, spending levels and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The effects of COVID-19 could affect our ability to successfully operate in many ways, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\u25cf the impact of the pandemic on the economies and financial markets of the countries and regions in which we operate, including a potential global recession, a decline in consumer confidence and spending, or an increase in unemployment levels, has resulted, and could continue to result, in consumers having less disposable income and, in turn, decreased sales of our products;\n\u25cf significant increases in online shopping and by other digital means, or other changes in consumer behavior, have been accelerated by COVID-19 and could adversely affect our sales;\n\u25cf the failure of our wholesale customers to whom we extend credit to pay amounts owed to us on time, or at all, particularly if such customers are significantly impacted by COVID-19;\n\u25cf a more promotional retail environment or our ability to move existing inventory, which may cause us to lower our prices, sell existing inventory at larger discounts than in the past, or write-down the value of inventory, and increase the costs and expenses of updating and replacing inventory, negatively impacting our margins;\n\u25cf the risk that social distancing measures and general consumer behaviors due to the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact mall and store traffic and that the re-occurrence of COVID-19 outbreaks or the fear of additional outbreaks could cause governments to impose additional restrictions and customers to avoid public\nplaces, such as malls and outlets, where the retail stores of our wholesale customers and our stores are located; and\n\u25cf the increase in the number of personnel working offsite may make our business more vulnerable to cybersecurity breach attempts, and, this period of uncertainty could result in an increase in phishing and other scams, fraud, money laundering, theft and other criminal activity.\nRestrictions on travel and group gatherings, the closing or reduced operation of restaurants, sports leagues and forms of communal entertainment and the fear of contracting COVID-19 have materially adversely affected store traffic and retail sales. Most retail store chains and shopping malls operated on a reduced basis during the second half of fiscal 2021 compared to pre-pandemic operations. The onset of additional COVID-19 waves threatens future periods of mandated store closures and additional restrictions on consumers that would limit commercial behavior. Certain states and cities reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, \u201cshelter in place\u201d rules and phased reopenings. While the substantial majority of these restrictions have since expired, others have been reinstated in certain states or cities which saw a new spike in COVID-19 cases. Such restrictions could be reinstated in the same or other areas as COVID-19 cases increase which could result in additional retail store restrictions or closures. If the retail economy weakens and/or consumers reduce purchases in the near or long-term as a result of the negative effects of on the U.S. and worldwide economies caused by COVID-19, retailers may need to reduce or limit store operations, close additional stores and be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, and any governmental restrictions imposed in the United States and around the world as a result thereof, would adversely affect the financial health of our retail, distributor and joint venture partners, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the geographic spread of the virus and its variants, the severity of the disease, the duration of any outbreak, the restrictive actions that are being taken by governmental authorities in the United States and around the world to contain an outbreak or to treat its impact, as well as the uncertainty associated with the timing and efficacy of efforts in the United States and around the world to vaccinate people against COVID-19, makes it difficult to forecast its effects on our fiscal 2023 results. Our results of operations for fiscal 2021 reflected the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our results improved in fiscal 2022, there could be adverse impacts in fiscal 2023. It is difficult, if not impossible, at this time to predict the magnitude of the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Wholesale Operations\nThe failure to maintain our material license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on sales of licensed products for a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal 2022, net sales of licensed product accounted for 67.2% of our net sales compared to 68.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 65.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2020.\nWe are generally required to achieve specified minimum net sales, make specified royalty and advertising payments and receive prior approval from the licensor as to all design and other elements of each product prior to production. License agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of the material requirements of a license agreement or receive approval with respect to a restricted transaction, a licensor will usually have the right to terminate our license. Even if a licensor does not terminate our license, the failure to achieve net sales sufficient to cover our required minimum royalty payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If a license contains a renewal option, there are usually minimum net sales and other conditions that must be met in order to be able to renew. If a license does not contain a renewal option, and we desire to renew the license, we must negotiate renewal terms with the licensor. However, even if we comply with all of the terms of a license agreement, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew an agreement when it expires even if we desire to do so as a licensor may decide to manufacture the licensed products itself or engage a new licensee for the products. The failure to maintain or renew our material license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with PVH and its Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger brands would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we have license agreements relating to a variety of products sold under the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, both of which are owned by PVH. Net sales of these two brands owned by PVH constituted approximately 50.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and approximately 53.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2021. Any adverse change in our relationship with PVH or in the reputation of Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger, or our inability to renew licenses for either the Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger brands as their current terms end, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.\nWe strive to offer our products on a multiple brand, multiple channel and multiple price point basis. As a part of this strategy, we license the names and brands of numerous recognized companies and designers. In entering into these license agreements, we plan our products to be targeted towards different market segments based on consumer demographics, design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution. In addition to granting us a license to produce and sell products, our licensors typically produce and sell their own products and may also grant licenses to third parties to produce and sell products. If any of our licensors decides to \u201creposition\u201d its products under the brands we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution, target market or competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand\u2019s business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. Further, we are unable to control the quality of the products produced by our licensors and their other licensees. If they do not maintain the quality of their goods, the brand image may be adversely affected, which could also affect our sales and profitability. In addition, as licensed products may be personally associated with designers, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individuals\u2019 images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.\nOur business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain or enhance the images of our proprietary brands.\nThe growth of our proprietary brands, their favorable images and our customers\u2019 connection to our brands has contributed to our success. Our proprietary brands include the DKNY and Donna Karan brands, G.H. Bass, Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc and Wilsons Leather, among others, including the recently acquired Sonia Rykiel brand. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions of a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding G-III, our brands, our products or the failure, on the part of G-III or our employees, to maintain the safety, integrity and ethics standards that we set for our operations, as well as those expected of members of our industry could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Social media influencers or other endorsers of our products could engage in behavior that reflects poorly on our brands and may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. Any harm to our brands or reputation could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our customers change their buying patterns, request additional allowances, develop their own private label brands or enter into agreements with national brand manufacturers to sell their products on an exclusive basis, our sales to these customers could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customers\u2019 buying patterns, as well as the need to provide additional allowances to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Strategic initiatives undertaken by our customers, including developing their own private labels brands, selling national brands on an exclusive basis or reducing the number of vendors they purchase from, could also impact our sales to these customers. There is a trend among major retailers to concentrate purchasing among a narrowing group of vendors. To the extent that any of our key customers reduces the number of its vendors and, as a result, reduces or eliminates purchases from us, there could be a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have significant customer concentration, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business.\nOur ten largest customers, all of which are department or discount store groups, accounted for approximately 78.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 73.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 72.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2020, with the Macy\u2019s Inc. group accounting for approximately 23.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 20.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 26.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. TJX Companies accounted for approximately 14.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 12.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 13.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. In addition, Ross Stores accounted for approximately 12.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 9.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 7.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. We expect that these customers will continue to provide a significant percentage of our sales. Reductions in purchases by these customers or other large retailers could adversely affect our sales.\nSales to customers generally occur on an order-by-order basis that may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, increase the use of their own private label brands, sell a national brand on an exclusive basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations. The loss of any of our large customers, the reduction in stores operated by a large customer or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Relating to Our Retail Operations\nOur retail operations may continue to incur losses if the revisions to our retail operations do not significantly improve our results of operations.\nOur retail operations segment reported an operating loss of $24.8 million in fiscal 2022, $126.8 million in fiscal 2021 and $74.6 million in fiscal 2020. This segment may continue to report operating losses for the near term even after the completion of the restructuring of our retail operations in fiscal 2021. Our ongoing plan focuses on the operations and growth of our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores, as well as operating our digital business. Our plan is based on the assumed continued strength of the DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld brands, changes in planning and allocation and improvements in gross margin. We expect to reduce administrative costs while expanding our store base. We need to successfully implement this strategy in order to continue to reduce the losses in our retail operations segment with the goal of ultimately attaining profitability in this segment. If we are not successful in implementing and managing our plans with respect to operating our retail business, we may not be able to achieve operating enhancements, sales growth and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRestructuring of our retail operations resulted in our incurring charges for impairment of retail assets. We have recorded asset impairments in the past and may be required in the future to record impairments of fixed assets or right-of-use assets or incur other charges relating to our company-operated retail stores.\nImpairment testing of our assets related to the operation of our retail stores requires us to make estimates about our future performance and cash flows that are inherently uncertain. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic conditions, our results of operations, and competitive conditions in the industry. Due to the fixed-cost structure associated with our retail operations, negative cash flows or the closure of a store could result in an impairment of leasehold improvements, operating lease assets, right-of-use assets or other long-lived assets, write-downs of inventory, severance costs, lease termination costs or the loss of working capital, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. We recorded impairments related to our retail operations of $1.1 million, net of gain on lease modifications, in fiscal 2022, $16.8 million, net of gain on lease modifications, in fiscal 2021, and $19.8 million, net of gain on lease modifications, in fiscal 2020. We may be required to record additional impairments or other charges relating to restructuring our retail operations. The recording of additional impairments or other charges in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or future results.\nLeasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.\nAll of the stores operated by us are leased. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Store leases generally require us to pay a fixed minimum rent and a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the applicable lease term. As each of our leases expires, if we do not have a renewal option, we may be unable to negotiate a renewal on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. In addition, we may not be able to close an unprofitable store due to an existing operating covenant, which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location.\nOur retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop. A reduction in the volume of outlet mall traffic could adversely affect our retail sales.\nSubstantially all of the stores in our retail operations segment are operated as outlet stores and located in larger outlet centers, many of which are located in, or near, vacation destinations or away from large population centers where department stores and other traditional retailers are concentrated. Economic uncertainty, increased fuel prices, travel concerns and other circumstances, which would lead to decreased travel, could have a material adverse effect on sales at our outlet stores. Other factors that could affect the success of our outlet stores include:\n\u25cf the location of the outlet mall or the location of a particular store within the mall;\n\u25cf the other tenants occupying space at the outlet mall;\n\u25cf increased competition in areas where the outlet malls are located;\n\u25cf a downturn in the economy generally or in a particular area where an outlet mall is located;\n\u25cf the shift to online shopping;\n\u25cf a downturn in foreign shoppers in the United States; and\n\u25cf the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to outlet malls.\nSales at our outlet stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic at the malls where our stores are located. In fiscal 2021, traffic at all retail stores was significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2022, retail store traffic continued to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels, particularly as a result of international travel restrictions. Although stores have re-opened, we cannot predict if stores will be forced to close again or have their operations restricted, how long store closures or new restrictions would be in effect as a result of additional outbreaks, whether additional outbreaks will affect purchases by consumers at retail stores or how large an effect additional outbreaks will have on retail sales volume.\nOur outlet stores benefit from the ability of a mall\u2019s other tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of outlet malls as shopping destinations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations, including the type and nature of the other retailers located near our stores, that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than expected. A reduction in outlet mall traffic as a result of these or other factors could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur digital business faces distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage this business could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nWe are investing in our digital business and seeking to increase the amount of business derived from our digital operations. The successful operation and expansion of our digital business, as well as our ability to provide a positive shopping experience that will generate orders and drive subsequent visits, depends on operating an appealing digital platform and providing an efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations. Risks associated with our digital business include:\n\u25cf the security or failure of the computer systems, including those of third-party vendors, that operate our digital sites including, among others, inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in\nprogramming, security breaches or other cybersecurity concerns, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems;\n\u25cf disruptions in the Internet or telecom service or power outages;\n\u25cf reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software and merchandise deliveries;\n\u25cf rapid technology changes;\n\u25cf the failure to deliver products to customers on-time, as ordered and without damage or to satisfy customer expectations;\n\u25cf credit or debit card fraud and other payment processing issues;\n\u25cf liability for online content; and\n\u25cf consumer privacy concerns and regulations.\nProblems in any of these areas could result in a reduction in sales, increased costs and damage to our reputation and brands, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Operation of Our Business\nIf we lose the services of our key personnel, or are unable to attract key personnel, our business will be harmed.\nOur future success depends on Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and other key personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Goldfarb and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on us and the market price of our common stock. Our other executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to attract key personnel could also adversely affect us.\nWe have expanded our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources, an inability to integrate acquired operations and extra expenses. This could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nPart of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could divert our management\u2019s time and resources. Acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated with our operations. We may not realize the intended benefits of an acquisition or an acquisition may fail to generate expected financial results. We also might not be successful in identifying or negotiating suitable acquisitions, which could negatively impact our growth strategy. If acquisitions disrupt our operations, our business may suffer.\nWe conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures. Joint ventures could fail to meet our expectations or cease to deliver anticipated benefits. There could also be disagreements with our joint venture partners that could adversely affect our interest a joint venture.\nWe own 49% of a joint venture that licenses to G-III the right to produce and sell Karl Lagerfeld Paris products in the United States, Mexico and Canada and 75% of a joint venture that licenses the right to produce and sell DKNY and Donna Karan products in China. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Joint ventures involve numerous risks, and could fail to meet our initial or ongoing expectations. The anticipated synergies or other benefits of a joint venture may fail to materialize due to changing business conditions or changes in our business priorities or those of our joint venture partners. Our joint venture partners, as well as any future partners, may have interests that are different from our interests that may result in conflicting views as to the conduct of the business or future direction of the joint venture. In the event that we have a disagreement with a joint venture partner with respect to a particular issue to come before the joint venture, or as to the management or conduct of the business of the joint venture, we may not be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. Any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in the joint venture, the business of the joint venture or the portion of our growth strategy related to the joint venture.\nWe may need additional financing to continue to grow.\nThe continued growth of our business, including as a result of acquisitions, depends on our access to sufficient funds to support our growth. Our primary source of working capital to support the growth of our operations is our ABL Credit Agreement which extends to August 2025. Our growth is dependent on our ability to continue to be able to extend and, if necessary, increase this credit facility. We also issued Senior Secured Notes in fiscal 2021. While we were able to refinance our debt in fiscal 2021, we cannot be sure we will be able to continue to secure alternative financing on satisfactory terms or at all. The loss of the use of our credit facility or the inability to replace this facility or the Senior Secured Notes when each expires or matures would materially impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur business is highly seasonal.\nRetail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales during the third and fourth quarters. Net sales during the third and fourth quarters accounted for approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 66% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2020. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. Any difficulties we may encounter during this period as a result of weather or disruption of manufacturing or transportation of our products will have a magnified effect on our results of operations for the year. In addition, because of the large amount of outerwear we sell at both wholesale and retail, unusually warm weather conditions during the peak fall and winter outerwear selling season, including as a result of any change in historical climate patterns, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our quarterly results of operations for our retail business also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodels, competitive factors, weather and general economic conditions. The second half of the year is expected to continue to have a disproportionate effect on our annual results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nExtreme or unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business.\nExtreme weather events and changes in weather patterns can influence customer trends and shopping habits. Extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the fall and winter seasons, or cool weather during the summer season, may diminish demand for our seasonal merchandise. Heavy snowfall, hurricanes or other severe weather events in the areas in which our retail stores and the retail stores of our wholesale customers are located may decrease customer traffic in those stores and reduce our sales and profitability. If severe weather events were to force closure of or disrupt operations at the distribution centers we use for our merchandise, we could incur higher costs and experience longer lead times to distribute our products to our retail stores, wholesale customers or digital channel customers. If prolonged, such extreme or unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to deliver our products to the market could be disrupted if we encounter problems affecting our logistics and distribution systems.\nWe rely on distribution facilities operated by us or by third parties to transport, warehouse and ship products to our customers. Our logistic and distribution systems include computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Substantially all of our products are distributed from a few key locations. Therefore, our operations could be interrupted by travel restrictions, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions affecting our distribution facilities. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from our distribution facilities. If we encounter problems affecting our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nSupply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our ability to import our products in a timely manner and our freight costs.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the shipping industry have negatively impacted our ability to import our products in a manner that allows for timely delivery to our customers. Congestion at ports of loading and ports of entry have caused significant delays in deliveries and changes to the itineraries of our steamship carriers. Use of alternate routes or delivery methods would require additional trucking for us and our customers. Truck driver shortages, shortages of truck equipment and the inability of ports to provide reliable pick up times, have also negatively impacted our ability to timely receive goods. If we are unable to mitigate these supply chain disruptions, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory and complete sales could be materially adversely affected.\nContractual shipping rates have increased as a result of increased demand for container space and the logistical delays experienced by the shipping industry. Our costs have increased as a result of higher contractual shipping rates and the need to purchase additional container space on the secondary market at higher spot rates. Terminals are also now imposing additional fees on importers not picking up containers on time, even when equipment and labor shortages negatively affect the ability of importers to pick up in a timely manner.\nIf we are unable to secure container space on a vessel due to limited availability, we may experience delays in shipping product from our overseas suppliers and ultimately to our customers. Furthermore, even when we are able to secure space, ports around the world are experiencing congestion, slowing transit times of product through ports of entry which negatively affects our ability to timely receive and deliver product to our retail partners and customers.\nIf we are unable to mitigate these supply chain disruptions, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory and complete sales could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to offset higher freight and other costs through product price increases or other measures, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We compete with numerous entities for supplies of materials and manufacturing capacity. Raw materials are vulnerable to adverse climate conditions, animal diseases and natural disasters that can affect the supply and price of raw materials. We may not be able to pass on all or any portion of higher raw material prices to our customers. Future increases in raw material prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny raw material price increase or increase in costs related to the transport of our products could increase our cost of sales and potentially decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. In addition, if one or more of our competitors is able to reduce its production costs by taking greater advantage of any reductions in raw material prices, favorable sourcing agreements or new manufacturing technologies (which enable manufacturers to produce goods on a more cost-effective basis) we may face pricing pressures from those competitors and may be forced to reduce our prices or face a decline in net sales, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we inadequately protect, maintain and enforce our trademark and other intellectual property rights, or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We may, however, experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks. We cannot be sure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to protect our rights, or that any of our intellectual property will not be challenged or held invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others. Our failure to protect our\ntrademarks could diminish the value of our brands, and could cause customer or consumer confusion, which could, in turn, adversely affect the validity of our trademarks and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the course of our attempts to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, which would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts are common and may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion, such as with the international expansion of our DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc, Wilsons Leather and Sonia Rykiel businesses. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Enforcing rights to our intellectual property may be difficult and expensive, and we may not be successful in combating counterfeit products and stopping infringement of our intellectual property rights, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. Counterfeit products may reduce our net sales and may also damage our brands due to their lower quality. If we are unable to protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict with the intellectual property rights of others, and our efforts to enforce our trademark and other intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our trademark and other intellectual property rights. Any action to prosecute, enforce or defend any intellectual property claim, regardless of merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If we are found to have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages, obtain licenses, cease the manufacture, use or sale of certain intellectual property, or cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, our brands, business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\nWe currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, this could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brand. Although we attempt to protect our brand through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brand by our licensees. Although we make efforts to police the use of our trademarks by our licensees, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be sufficient to ensure that our licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event that our licensees fail to do so, our trademark rights could be harmed. Moreover, the misuse of our brand by, or negative publicity involving, a licensee, could have a material adverse effect on our brand and on us.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Economy and the Apparel Industry\nRecent and future economic conditions, including volatility in the financial and credit markets, may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic conditions have affected, and in the future may adversely affect, the apparel industry and our major customers. Economic conditions have, at times, led to a reduction in overall consumer spending, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. A significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial and/or credit position could also require us to sell fewer products to that customer, assume greater credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables or could limit our ability to collect receivables related to previous purchases by that customer. As a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nThe cyclical nature of the apparel industry and uncertainty over future economic prospects and consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical. Purchases of outerwear, sportswear, swimwear, footwear and other apparel and accessories tend to decline during recessionary periods and may decline for a variety of other reasons, including changes in fashion trends and the introduction of new products or pricing changes by our competitors. Retailers have also responded to the shift in the types of apparel purchased by consumers based on their adjusted lifestyle needs resulting from changes to the work environment and leisure activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainties regarding future economic prospects, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect consumer-spending habits and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Weak economic conditions have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations at times in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future as well.\nThe competitive nature of our industry may result in lower prices for our products and decreased gross profit margins.\nThe apparel business is highly competitive. We have numerous competitors with respect to the sale of apparel, footwear and accessories, including digital websites, distributors that import products from abroad and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities. Many of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and greater manufacturing capacity than we do. The general availability of contract manufacturing capacity also allows ease of access by new market entrants. The competitive nature of the apparel industry may result in lower prices for our products and decreased gross profit margins, either of which may materially adversely affect our sales and profitability. Sales of our products are affected by a number of competitive factors including style, price, quality, brand recognition and reputation, product appeal and general fashion trends.\nIf major department, mass merchant and specialty store chains consolidate, continue to close stores or cease to do business, our business could be negatively affected.\nWe sell our products to major department, mass merchant and specialty store chains. Continued consolidation in the retail industry, as well as store closing or retailers ceasing to do business, could negatively impact our business. Various customers of ours have encountered reductions in operations including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, as well as other store chains, that have reduced the number of stores they operated, Lord & Taylor, which closed all of its stores, and JC Penney and Christopher & Banks, each of which filed for bankruptcy. Store closings could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Consolidation could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. With increased consolidation in the retail industry, we are increasingly dependent on retailers whose bargaining strength may increase and whose share of our business may grow. As a result, we may face greater pressure from these customers to provide more favorable terms, including increased support of their retail margins. As purchasing decisions become more centralized, the risks from consolidation increase. A store group could decide to close stores, decrease the amount of product purchased from us, modify the amount of floor space allocated to apparel in general or to our products specifically or focus on promoting private label products or national brand products for which it has exclusive rights rather than promoting our products. Customers are also concentrating purchases among a narrowing group of vendors. These types of decisions by our key customers could adversely affect our business.\nThe effects of war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or public health crises could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe current war in Ukraine and the continued threat of terrorism, heightened security measures and military action in response to acts of terrorism or civil unrest has, at times, disrupted commerce and intensified concerns regarding the United States and world economies. Any further acts of terrorism or new or extended hostilities may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Similarly, the\noccurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods or earthquakes, or public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, our corporate headquarters or a significant number of stores or impact one or more of our key suppliers. The world economy has experienced increases in energy prices, as well as shortages, as a result of the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. These types of events could result in additional increases in energy prices or shortages, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of product, disruption in the transport of product from overseas, delay in the delivery of product to our factories, our customers or our stores and disruption in our information and communication systems. Accordingly, these types of events could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe are dependent upon foreign manufacturers.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We also do not have long-term written agreements with any of our manufacturers. As a result, any of these manufacturers may unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Almost all of our products are imported from independent foreign manufacturers. The failure of these manufacturers to meet required quality standards could damage our relationships with our customers. In addition, the failure by these manufacturers to ship products to us in a timely manner could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers. The failure to make timely deliveries could cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept delivery of products or demand reduced prices.\nAdditionally, our arrangements with foreign manufacturers subject us to risks of engaging in business abroad, including currency fluctuations, political or labor instability and potential import restrictions, duties and tariffs. We do not maintain insurance for the potential lost profits due to disruptions of our overseas manufacturers. Because our products are produced abroad, most significantly in Vietnam and China, political or economic instability in Vietnam, China or elsewhere could cause substantial disruption in the business of our foreign manufacturers. Products sourced from Vietnam represented approximately 32.2% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2022, 36.2% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2021 and 24.6% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2020. Products sourced from China represented approximately 34.2% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2022, 32.8% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2021 and 49.5% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2020.\nWhile we source our products from many different manufacturers, we rely on a few manufacturers for a significant amount of our products. In fiscal 2022, we sourced 35.5% and 17.1% of our purchases from two different vendors in Vietnam and in fiscal 2021, we sourced 10.7% of our purchases from one vendor in Vietnam. In fiscal 2022, we sourced 19.4% of our purchases from one vendor in China. The loss of key vendors or a disruption in receipt of products from key vendors could adversely affect our ability to deliver goods to our customers on time and in the requested quantities.\nWe are also dependent on these manufacturers for compliance with our policies and the policies of our licensors and customers regarding labor practices employed by factories that manufacture product for us. Any failure by these manufacturers to comply with required labor standards or any other divergence in their labor or other practices from those generally considered ethical in the United States and the potential negative publicity relating to any of these events, could result in a violation by us of our license agreements, and harm us and our reputation. In addition, a manufacturer\u2019s failure to comply with safety or content regulations and standards could result in substantial liability and harm to our reputation.\nOur expansion into the European market exposes us to uncertain economic conditions in the Euro zone.\nDemand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries in which we do business. We are attempting to expand our presence in the European markets, including for our DKNY, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin businesses, as well as for our recently acquired Sonia Rykiel brand. The economy in Europe is uncertain and potentially affected by the war in Ukraine and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial instability in Europe could adversely affect our European operations and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have foreign currency exposures relating to buying and selling in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our functional currency.\nWe have foreign currency exposure related to foreign denominated revenues and costs, which must be translated into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our reported earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. In addition, while certain currencies (notably the Hong Kong dollar and Chinese Renminbi) are currently managed in value in relation to the U.S. dollar by foreign central banks or governmental entities, such conditions may change, thereby exposing us to various risks as a result.\nCertain of our foreign operations purchase products from suppliers denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, which may expose such operations to increases in cost of goods sold (thereby lowering profit margins) as a result of foreign currency fluctuations. Our exposures are primarily concentrated in the Euro. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors purchase and sell products in the same market and the cost of certain items required in our operations. In addition, certain of our foreign operations have receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, which exposes such operations to foreign exchange losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations. Such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are not currently engaged in any hedging activities to protect against currency risks. If there is downward pressure on the value of the dollar, our purchase prices for our products could increase. We may not be able to offset an increase in product costs with a price increase to our customers.\nWe are subject to numerous risks associated with international operations.\nOur ability to capitalize on the potential of our international operations, including to realize the benefits of our DKNY, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin businesses, or of our newly acquired Sonia Rykiel brand, and successfully expand into international markets, is subject to risks associated with international operations. These include:\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;\n\u25cf local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u25cf more stringent regulation relating to privacy and data protection, including with respect to the collection, use and processing of personal information, particularly in Europe;\n\u25cf more stringent regulation relating to privacy and data access to, or use of, commercial or personal information, particularly in Europe;\n\u25cf less rigorous protection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf compliance with United States and other country laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf new tariffs or other barriers in international markets.\nWe are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations, including:\n\u25cf political instability and terrorist attacks;\n\u25cf changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u25cf general and economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nChanges in regulatory, geopolitical, social or economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.\nThe national security law adopted in Hong Kong may result in disruptions to our business operations in Hong Kong and additional tariffs and trade restrictions.\nIn June 2020, a new security law was put into effect that changes the way Hong Kong has been governed since the territory was handed over by England to China in 1997. This law increases the power of the central government in Beijing over Hong Kong, limits the civil liberties of residents of Hong Kong and could restrict their ability to conduct business in the same way as in the past on a go forward basis. The U.S. State Department has announced the U.S. would no longer consider Hong Kong to have significant autonomy from China which could end some or all of the U.S. government\u2019s special trade and economic relations with Hong Kong. This may result in disruption to our offices and employees located in Hong Kong, as well as the shipment of our products from Hong Kong. The potential disruption to our business operations in Hong Kong and additional tariffs and trade restrictions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, no such disruptions have occurred.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Information Technology\nLaws on privacy continue to evolve, and place further limits on how we collect or use customer information could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect, store and process customer information primarily for marketing purposes and to improve the services we provide. There are numerous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure and protection of personal data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between states within a country or between countries. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) has caused significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies with users and operations in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). Under GDPR, fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company\u2019s annual global revenues, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) limits how we may collect, use, and process personal data of California residents. To comply with the CCPA, we made certain changes to our data processing practices and policies but it may require that we further modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. California also enacted the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023, which creates additional obligations regarding consumer data and could increase compliance risks, costs and expenses. Other states may decide to adopt similar privacy laws. Non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability. Although we make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of non-compliance. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may additionally be subject to claims, or other obligations, as well as financial and reputational damage, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny limitations imposed on the use of customer information by federal, state, local or foreign governments, could have an adverse effect on our future marketing activities. Governmental focus on data security and/or privacy may lead to additional legislation or regulations. As a result, we may have to modify our business to further improve data security and privacy compliance, which would result in increased expenses and operating complexity, or in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers\u2019 business, results of operations or financial condition. To the extent our, or our business partners\u2019, security procedures and protection of customer information prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or other claims, fines, penalties or other obligations, which could expose us to liability and cause damage to our reputation, brand and results of operations.\nWe are subject to rules relating to the processing of credit card payments. Failure to comply with these rules could result in an ability to process payments which would adversely affect our retail business.\nBecause we process and transmit payment card information, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d), and card brand operating rules (\u201cCard Rules\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security that was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. We are required by Card Rules to comply with the Standard, and our failure to do so may result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under\ncertain circumstances specified in the Card Rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract the management team of our retail business and require it to undertake disruptive, costly and time-consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach, which may materially affect our reputation and our ability to conduct our business. Further, changes in technology and processing procedures may result in changes to the Card Rules. Such changes may require us to make significant investments in operating systems and technology that may impact our business. Failure to keep up with changes in technology could result in the loss of business. Failure to comply with the Standard or Card Rules could result in losing certification under the PCI standards and an inability to process payments.\nIf we do not successfully upgrade, maintain and secure our information systems to support the needs of our organization, this could have an adverse impact on the operation of our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to manage operations, including a full range of financial, sourcing, retail and merchandising systems, and regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems. The reliability and capacity of our information systems is critical. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, power outages, fire, natural disasters, systems failures and other technical malfunctions. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyber-attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience business disruptions, reputational damage, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, increased overhead costs, excess inventory, product shortages and a loss of important information, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. Any disruptions affecting our information systems, or any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or in integrating them with current systems, could have a material adverse impact on the operation of our business. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. If any of these risks materialize, our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected.\nA data security or privacy breach could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit and store personal, sensitive and confidential information, including our proprietary business information and that of consumers (including users of our websites) and our wholesale partners, distributors, employees, suppliers and business partners. The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. Customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyberattack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.\nBecause the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers\u2019 identity and privacy. We do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nTariffs that have been, and might be, imposed by the United States government or a resulting trade war could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegislation that would restrict the importation or increase the cost of textiles and apparel produced abroad has been periodically introduced in Congress. The enactment of new legislation or international trade regulation, or executive action affecting international textile or trade agreements, could adversely affect our business. International trade agreements that can provide for tariffs and/or quotas can increase the cost and limit the amount of product that can be imported.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed in the U.S., the European Union, Asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future, or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.\nThe apparel and accessories industry has been impacted by Section 301 tariffs imposed by the United States government on goods imported from China. Tariffs on handbags and leather outerwear imported from China were effective beginning in September 2018. These tariffs initially increased existing duties by 10% of the merchandise cost to us. The level of tariffs on these product categories was later increased to 25% beginning May 10, 2019.\nOn August 1, 2019, the United States government announced new 10% tariffs that cover the remaining estimated $300 billion of inbound trade from China, including most of our apparel products. On August 23, 2019, the United States government announced that the new tariffs would increase from 10% to 15%. A portion of the new 15% tariffs went into effect on September 1, 2019. Some of the additional tariffs on certain categories of products were delayed until December 15, 2019, but have not yet gone into effect as the United States and China entered into a \u201cphase one\u201d trade agreement in January 2020.\nIt is difficult to accurately estimate the impact on our business from these tariff actions or similar actions or when any additional tariffs may become effective. For fiscal 2022, approximately 34.2% of the products that we sold were manufactured in China. For fiscal 2021, approximately 32.8% of the products that we sold were manufactured in China.\nThe United States government continues to negotiate with China with respect to a \u201cphase two\u201d trade agreement, which could lead to the removal, lowering or postponement of the additional tariffs. If the U.S. and China are not able to resolve their differences, additional tariffs may be put in place and additional products may become subject to tariffs. Tariffs on additional products imported by us from China would increase our costs, could require us to increase prices to our customers and would cause us to seek price concessions from our vendors. If we are unable to increase prices to offset an increase in tariffs, this would result in our realizing lower gross margins on the products sold by us and will negatively impact our operating results. We have reduced our reliance on China by moving production to other countries, including Vietnam and Indonesia. We will continue to explore alternative production partners to further diversify our sourcing network and to reduce our reliance on any one particular country. These efforts may not enable us to offset the adverse effects of any increases in tariffs.\nChina\u2019s accession agreement for membership in the World Trade Organization provides that member countries, including the United States, may impose safeguard quotas on specific products. We are unable to assess the potential for future\naction by the United States government with respect to any product category in the event that the quantity of imported apparel significantly disrupts the apparel market in the United States. Future action by the United States in response to a disruption in its apparel markets could limit our ability to import apparel and increase our costs.\nWe have been audited by the Canadian Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) and are in the process of appealing the CBSA ruling. Loss of this appeal could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn October 2017, the CBSA issued a final audit report to G-III\u2019s Canadian subsidiary (\u201cG-III Canada\u201d) that challenged the valuation used by G-III Canada for certain goods imported into Canada. The period covered by the examination is February 1, 2014 through October 27, 2017, the date of the final report. The CBSA has requested G-III Canada to reassess its customs entries for that period using the price paid or payable by the Canadian retail customers for certain imported goods rather than the price paid by G-III Canada to the vendor. The CBSA has also requested that G-III Canada change the valuation method used to pay duties with respect to goods imported in the future.\nIn March 2018, G-III Canada provided a bond to guarantee payment to the CBSA for additional duties payable as a result of the reassessment required by the final audit report. We secured a bond in the amount of CAD$26.9 million ($20.9 million) representing customs duty and interest through December 31, 2017 that is claimed to be owed to the CBSA. In March 2018, we amended the duties filed for the month of January 2018 in accordance with the new valuation method. This amount was paid to the CBSA. Beginning February 1, 2018, we began paying duties based on the new valuation method. Cumulative amounts paid and deferred through January 31, 2022, related to the higher dutiable values, were CAD$14.7 million ($11.6 million).\nEffective June 1, 2019, we commenced paying based on the dutiable value of G-III Canada\u2019s imports in Canada based on pre-audit levels. G-III continued to defer the additional duty paid through the month of May 2019 pending the final outcome of the appeal.\nThe CBSA issued its final decision denying the appeal filed by G-III Canada with the President\u2019s Office of the CBSA. G-III Canada filed a Notice of Appeal with the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) further appealing the CBSA decision. A hearing on the appeal was held on December 7, 2021.\nIf our appeal of the audit findings is not successful, we will have to pay the duties and interest that have been secured by the bond. This will result in a charge to our statement of operations for past duties, as well as for the additional duties we deferred or have not paid beginning on February 1, 2018 through the conclusion of the appeal process. In addition, our loss of the appeal could result in increased duties paid in Canada on products imported into Canada and could increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could impact our business.\nThe change in the U.S. presidency and control of Congress last year could result in changes to U.S. tax laws that would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Although we believe our income tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcomes may have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent on the allocation of revenue and expenses in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes. Changes in the U.S. federal, state, and international tax legislations can have an adverse impact on our income tax liabilities and effective tax rate.\nOur future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business operations, changes in tax laws or rulings, or developments in government tax examinations. A number of countries are actively pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax liability, including an examination of our existing transfer pricing policies. Adverse outcomes from examinations may lead to adjustments to our income tax liabilities or provisions for uncertain tax position reserves.\nWe are required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect the market price of our securities.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq regularly propose and adopt new regulatory requirements.\nThe internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may not prevent or detect misstatements because of certain of its limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. We cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. Discovery and disclosure of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a material impact on our financial statements and could cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nWhile we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs and continue to update our programs in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.\nOther Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe increased focus by stakeholders on corporate responsibility issues, including those associated with environmental, social and governance issues, could negatively affect our business and operations.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change, including through disruption to our supply chain, potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products and availability and pricing of raw materials. There is also increased focus from our stakeholders, including consumers, employees and investors, on corporate responsibility matters associated with environmental, social and governance issues. Although we have announced our corporate responsibility strategy and increased focus on these issues, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals. Failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals could damage our reputation, causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in us and our brands, and negatively impact our operations.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and could continue to fluctuate significantly.\nBetween February 1, 2019 and March 23, 2022, the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of\u2009$2.96 to a high of $43.98 per share. The market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in our quarterly revenues or those of our competitors as a result of seasonality or other factors;\n\u25cf a shortfall in revenues or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in product pricing policies by our competitors or our customers;\n\u25cf changes in tariff and trade policies;\n\u25cf actual or perceived adverse effects from the coronavirus outbreak;\n\u25cf general conditions in our industry; and\n\u25cf general conditions in the securities markets.\nOur actual financial results might vary from our publicly disclosed financial forecasts.\nFrom time to time, we have publicly disclosed financial forecasts. Our forecasts reflect numerous assumptions concerning our expected performance, as well as other factors that are beyond our control and that might not turn out to be correct. As a result, variations from our forecasts could be material. Our financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. If our actual financial results are worse than our financial forecasts or forecasts provided by outside investment analysts, or others, the price of our common stock may decline. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. Similar to many other companies in our industry, we did not provide financial forecasts for the full fiscal 2021 year or for the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 due to uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We do not have any responsibility to provide financial forecasts going forward or to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise.\nIf our goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles become impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles in an aggregate amount of $747.2 million, or approximately 27% of our total assets and approximately 49% of our stockholders\u2019 equity. Approximately $621.7 million of our goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles was recorded in connection with our acquisition of DKNY and Donna Karan. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we review our goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles for impairment annually as of January 31 of each fiscal year and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable due to factors such as reduced estimates of future cash flows and profitability, increased cost of debt, slower growth rates in our industry or a decline in our stock price and market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows and profitability are based on an updated long-term financial outlook of our operations. However, actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates. A significant decline in our market capitalization or deterioration in our projected results could result in an impairment of our goodwill, trademarks and/or other intangibles. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill is determined to exist which would negatively impact our results of operations and could negatively the market price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.\nWe have issued $400 million of Senior Secured Notes and are party to the ABL Credit Agreement that provides for borrowings of up to $650 million, subject to borrowing base availability. In addition, we also incurred $125.0 million of debt pursuant to the LVMH Note that constituted a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of DKNY and Donna Karan.\nOur significant amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position.\nFor example, it could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u25cf place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and\n\u25cf increase our cost of borrowing.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could intensify the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future. Although the ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThe covenants under any future debt instruments could also allow us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness. In addition to any amounts that might be available to us for borrowing under the ABL Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, we will have the right to request an increase of aggregate commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million by obtaining additional commitments either from one or more of the lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement or other lending institutions. The more leveraged we become, the more we will be exposed to certain risks described above under \u201c-We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.\u201d\nThe ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our current and future operating flexibility, particularly our ability to respond to changes in the economy or our industry or to take certain actions, which could harm our long term interests and may limit our ability to make payments under the Notes or the ABL Credit Agreement or satisfy our other obligations.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u25cf incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof);\n\u25cf pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u25cf prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u25cf issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u25cf incur liens on assets;\n\u25cf make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments;\n\u25cf allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf alter the business that we conduct; and\n\u25cf sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u25cf limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u25cf unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u25cf unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture or the ABL Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under the ABL Credit Agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that Agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the ABL Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of the Senior Secured Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nOur ability to continue to have the necessary liquidity to operate our business may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including uncertain conditions in the credit and financial markets, which could limit the availability and increase the cost of financing. A deterioration of our results of operations and cash flow resulting from decreases in consumer spending, could, among other things, impact our ability to comply with financial covenants in the ABL Credit Agreement.\nOur historical sources of liquidity to fund ongoing cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings through our credit facility and equity offerings. The sufficiency and availability of credit may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the tightening of the credit markets, including lending by financial institutions who are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity; an increase in the cost of capital; the reduced availability of credit; our ability to execute our strategy; the level of our cash flows, which will be impacted by retailer and consumer acceptance of our products and the level of consumer discretionary spending; maintenance of financial covenants included in our ABL Credit Agreement, interest rate fluctuations and the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and world-wide economies and on our business.\nInterest rates are expected to increase in fiscal 2023. We cannot predict the future level of interest rates or the effect of any increase in interest rates on the availability or aggregate cost of our borrowings. We cannot be certain that any additional required financing, whether debt or equity, will be available in amounts needed or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit facility. Compliance with these financial covenants is dependent on the results of our operations, which are subject to a number of factors including current economic conditions. The economic environment has at times resulted in lower consumer confidence and lower retail sales. Adverse developments in the economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, could lead to reduced consumer spending which could adversely impact our net sales and cash flow, which could affect our compliance with our financial covenants. A violation of our covenants could limit access to our credit facilities. Should such restrictions on our credit facilities and these factors occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including under the Senior Secured Notes or the ABL Credit Agreement, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including under the Senior Secured Notes or the ABL Credit Agreement.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations. Additionally, the ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the Senior Secured Notes will limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition of our assets. As a result, the ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nThe borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement will be at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn under the ABL Credit Agreement, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a $6.5 million change in annual cash interest expense under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nFinancing extended to us under the ABL Credit Agreement is made at variable rates that use LIBOR or an alternate base rate (as determined by that Agreement) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. The financial authority that regulates LIBOR has announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s). These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, our future indebtedness may require that such indebtedness be similarly repurchased upon a change of control. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the Notes. We may not be able to refinance the Notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding Notes or to purchase all validly tendered Notes would be an event of default under the indenture. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt. Our other debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture.\nIn addition, in certain circumstances specified in the indenture, we will be required to commence an asset sale offer, as defined in the indenture, pursuant to which we will be obligated to purchase certain Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds we receive from certain asset sales. Our other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit us from completing any such asset sale offer. In particular, the ABL Credit Agreement contains provisions that require us, upon the sale of certain assets, to apply all of the proceeds from such asset sale to the prepayment of amounts due under that Agreement. The mandatory prepayment obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement will be effectively senior to our obligations to make an asset sale offer with respect to the Notes under the terms of the indenture.\nOur credit rating and ability to access well-functioning capital markets are important to our ability to secure future debt financing on acceptable terms. Our credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with the Senior Secured Notes or our other indebtedness.\nOur access to the debt markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of the debt capital markets, our operating performance and our credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors including their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. Our borrowing costs will be dependent to some extent on the rating assigned to our debt. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit rating. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 75905, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "GIII"}
