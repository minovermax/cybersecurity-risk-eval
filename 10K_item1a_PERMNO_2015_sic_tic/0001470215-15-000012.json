{"cik": "1470215", "company": "Towers Watson & Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business. The descriptions below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us may also impair our business operations, financial condition or results. If any of the risks and uncertainties below or other risks were to occur, our business operations, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOn June 29, 2015, Towers Watson entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cTowers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among Towers Watson, Willis Group Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company (\u201cWillis\u201d), and Citadel Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Willis (\u201cWillis Merger Sub\u201d).\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement, Willis Merger Sub will merge with and into Towers Watson (the \u201cTowers Watson | Willis Merger\u201d), with Towers Watson surviving the Towers Watson | Willis Merger as a subsidiary of Willis.\nWillis will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will include a joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the proposed Towers Watson | Willis Merger. We urge you to read the registration statement on Form S-4 once it becomes available, because it will contain important information about the proposed Towers Watson | Willis Merger, including relevant risk factors.\nRisks Relating to the Pending Towers Watson | Willis Merger of Equals\nThe Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Towers Watson | Willis Merger may not be completed.\nThe Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be fulfilled to complete the Towers Watson | Willis Merger. Those conditions include: approval of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement by Towers Watson stockholders, approval of Willis\u2019 issuance of shares in connection with the Towers Watson | Willis Merger by Willis shareholders, clearance under the HSR Act and other anti-competition clearances, receipt of other regulatory approvals, absence of orders prohibiting completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, effectiveness of the registration statement Willis will file in connection with the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, approval of the Willis ordinary shares to be issued to Towers Watson stockholders for listing on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") and/or National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (\"NASDAQ\"), Willis not being treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of or after the closing date of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger as a result of a change in law, the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties of both parties subject to specified materiality standards, the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements and that no material adverse effect shall have occurred. The conditions to the closing of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Towers Watson | Willis Merger may not be completed. In addition, if the Towers Watson | Willis Merger is not completed by March 31, 2016, either Willis or Towers Watson may choose not to proceed with the Towers Watson | Willis Merger. In addition, Willis or Towers Watson may elect to terminate the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, before or after shareholder or stockholder approval, as applicable.\nThe Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict Towers Watson\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Towers Watson | Willis Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require Towers Watson to pay Willis a termination fee of up to $255 million.\nUnder the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement, Towers Watson is restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging, knowingly facilitating, discussing or negotiating, or furnishing information with regard to, any inquiry, proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal from any person or entity. If the Towers Watson board of directors (after consultation with Towers Watson\u2019s financial advisors and legal counsel) determines that such proposal is more favorable to the Towers Watson stockholders than the Towers Watson | Willis Merger and the Towers Watson board of directors recommends such proposal to the Towers Watson stockholders, Willis may be entitled to terminate the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement. Under such circumstances, Towers Watson may be required to pay Willis a termination fee equal to $255,000,000. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Towers Watson from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to enter into a transaction that would be more favorable to Towers Watson and its stockholders than the Towers Watson | Willis Merger. Additionally, in the event the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of the Towers Watson stockholders to approve the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement or Willis terminates the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement due to a breach by Towers Watson which would result in the conditions to the consummation of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger not being satisfied, Towers Watson must reimburse Willis for any and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses up to $45,000,000.\nWhile the Towers Watson | Willis Merger is pending, Towers Watson will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect its business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger on associates, clients, suppliers, business partners and other persons with whom Towers Watson has a business relationship may have an adverse effect on Towers Watson. In connection with the pendency of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, clients, suppliers, business partners and other persons with whom Towers Watson has a business relationship may delay or defer business decisions, decide to terminate, modify or renegotiate their relationships with Towers Watson, or take other actions as a result of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger that could negatively affect Towers Watson\u2019s revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of its securities. Towers Watson\u2019s ability to raise additional capital through the debt markets, and the associated borrowing costs, may also be negatively impacted.\nThese uncertainties about the effect of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger may impair Towers Watson\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Towers Watson | Willis Merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause clients, suppliers and others who deal with Towers Watson to seek to change existing business relationships with Towers Watson, or enter into business relationships with parties other than Towers Watson. Associate retention may be challenging during the pendency of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, as certain associates may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key associates depart, the business of Towers Watson prior to the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, and the business of the combined company following the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, could be materially harmed. If key associates join a competitor or form a new competitor, existing and potential clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of the services of Towers Watson. In addition, the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement restricts Towers Watson from taking specified actions until the Towers Watson | Willis Merger occurs without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent Towers Watson from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger or termination of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement.\nLegal proceedings in connection with the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger.\nSince the announcement of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger Agreement on June 30, 2015, several class actions have been filed in the Court of the Chancery for the State of Delaware, against Towers Watson, the members of its board of directors, Willis and Willis Merger Sub challenging the proposed Towers Watson | Willis Merger. The actions allege that the Towers Watson board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Towers Watson stockholders in connection with the Towers Watson | Willis Merger and that Willis and Willis Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs claim that the Towers Watson | Willis Merger involves an unfair price, an inadequate sales process, self-dealing, unreasonable deal protection devices and inadequate disclosures. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Towers Watson | Willis Merger. Such legal proceedings could delay or prevent the Towers Watson | Willis Merger from becoming effective within the agreed upon timeframe.\nFailure to complete the Towers Watson | Willis Merger could negatively impact Towers Watson and its future operations.\nIf the Towers Watson | Willis Merger is not completed for any reason, Towers Watson may be subjected to a number of material risks. The price of Towers Watson common stock may decline to the extent that their current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Towers Watson | Willis Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Towers Watson | Towers Watson | Willis Merger must be paid by Towers Watson whether or not the Towers Watson | Willis Merger is completed. Furthermore, Towers Watson may experience negative reactions from its stockholders, clients and associates.\nTowers Watson has incurred and will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger.\nTowers Watson has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, and also expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of Willis and Towers Watson over a period of time following the completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger. A portion of the transaction costs related to the Towers Watson | Willis Merger will be incurred regardless of whether the Towers Watson | Willis Merger is completed. While Towers Watson has assumed that a certain level of transaction and coordination expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond Towers Watson\u2019s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and coordination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by Towers Watson. These costs could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operation of Towers Watson prior to the Towers Watson | Willis Merger and of the combined company following the Towers Watson | Willis Merger.\nThe market price for Willis ordinary shares following the closing of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Towers Watson common stock and Willis ordinary shares.\nUpon completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, holders of shares of Towers Watson common stock (other than Willis, Merger Sub and Towers Watson and any holders who are entitled to and who properly exercise and perfect dissenter\u2019s rights under Delaware law) will become holders of Willis ordinary shares. Willis\u2019 businesses differ from those of Towers Watson, and accordingly the results of operations of Willis will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Towers Watson. The results of operation of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those currently affecting Willis.\nWillis ordinary shares to be received by Towers Watson stockholders as a result of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger will have rights different from the shares of Towers Watson common stock.\nUpon completion of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger, the rights of former Towers Watson stockholders who become Willis shareholders will be governed by the Constitution of Willis and by Irish law. The rights associated with shares of Towers Watson common stock are different from the rights associated with Willis ordinary shares. Material differences between the rights of stockholders of Towers Watson and the rights of shareholders of Willis include differences with respect to, among other things, consolidation and division of shares, reduction of share capital, distributions, dividends, repurchases and redemptions, dividends in shares / bonus issues, the election of directors, the removal of directors, the fiduciary and statutory duties of directors, conflicts of interests of directors, the indemnification of directors and officers, limitations on director liability, the convening of annual meetings of shareholders or stockholders (as applicable), and special shareholder or stockholder meetings (as applicable), notice provisions for meetings, the adjournment of shareholder or stockholder meetings (as applicable), the exercise of voting rights, shareholder or stockholder action by written consent (as applicable), shareholder or stockholder suits (as applicable), shareholder or stockholder approval of certain transactions (as applicable), rights of inspection of books and records, rights of dissenting shareholders or stockholders (as applicable), anti-takeover measures and provisions relating to the ability to amend the governing documents.\nWillis and Towers Watson may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Towers Watson | Willis Merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The combined company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.\nThe ability of Willis and Towers Watson to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company\u2019s ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, Willis and Towers Watson will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating their business practices and operations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization of the full-expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company.\nIn addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of client relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, systems, procedures and policies for the combined company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new clients;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nMany of these factors will be outside of the control of Willis or Towers Watson and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of Willis and Towers Watson are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Willis and Towers Watson. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of the combined company\u2019s ordinary shares. As a result, we cannot assure you that the combination of Willis and Towers Watson will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nDemand for our services could decrease for various reasons, including a general economic downturn, a decline in a client\u2019s or an industry\u2019s financial condition or prospects, or a decline in defined benefit pension plans that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe can give no assurance that the demand for our services will grow or that we will compete successfully with our existing competitors, new competitors or our clients\u2019 internal capabilities. Client demand for our services may change based on the clients\u2019 needs and financial conditions.\nOur results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve. Economic slowdowns in some markets, particularly in the United States, have caused and may continue to cause reduction in discretionary spending by our clients, result in longer client payment terms, an increase in late payments by clients and an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable, each of which may reduce the demand for our services, increase price competition and adversely impact our growth, profit margins and liquidity. If our clients enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations (which has already occurred with respect to some of our current clients), our revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the demand for many of our core benefit services, including compliance-related services, is affected by government regulation and taxation of employee benefit plans. Significant changes in tax or social welfare policy or other regulations could lead some employers to discontinue their employee benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, thereby reducing the demand for our services. A simplification of regulations or tax policy also could reduce the need for our services.\nWe could be subject to claims arising from our work, as well as government inquiries and investigations, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial condition.\nProfessional services providers, including those in the human capital and risk management sectors such as Towers Watson, depend in large part on their relationships with clients and their reputation for high-quality services. Clients that may become dissatisfied with our services may terminate their business relationships with us and clients and third parties that claim they suffered damages caused by our services may bring lawsuits against us. The nature of our work, particularly our actuarial services, necessarily involves the use of assumptions and the preparation of estimates relating to future and contingent events,\nthe actual outcome of which we cannot know in advance. Our actuarial services also rely on substantial amounts of data provided by clients, the accuracy and quality of which we cannot ensure. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data management errors in connection with the services we provide to clients.\nClients may seek to hold us responsible for the financial consequences of variances between assumptions and estimates and actual outcomes or for errors. For example, clients may make:\n\u2022\nClaims that actuarial assumptions were unreasonable or that there were computational errors leading to pension plan underfunding or under-reserving for insurance claim liabilities;\n\u2022\nClaims of failure to review adequately or detect deficiencies in data, which could lead to an underestimation of pension plan or insurance claim liabilities; and\n\u2022\nClaims that employee benefit plan documents were misinterpreted or plan amendments were faulty, leading to unintended plan benefits or overpayments to beneficiaries.\nGiven that we frequently work with large pension funds and insurance companies, relatively small percentage errors or variances can create significant financial variances and result in significant claims for unintended or unfunded liabilities. The risks from such variances or errors could be aggravated in an environment of declining pension fund asset values and insurance company capital levels. In almost all cases, our exposure to liability with respect to a particular engagement is substantially greater than the revenue opportunity that the engagement generates for us.\nIn the case of liability for pension plan actuarial errors, a client\u2019s claims might focus on the client\u2019s alleged reliance that actuarial assumptions were reasonable and, based on such reliance, the client made benefit commitments the client may later claim are not affordable or funding decisions that result in plan underfunding if and when actual outcomes vary from actuarial assumptions.\nLawsuits arising out of any of our services could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition and could result in increased insurance costs or a reduction in the amount of available insurance coverage. In addition to defense costs and liability exposure, which may be significant, claims may produce negative publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and could require substantial amounts of management attention, which could affect management\u2019s focus on operations.\nFinally, we may be subject to inquiries and investigations by federal, state or other governmental agencies regarding aspects of our clients\u2019 businesses or our own businesses, especially regulated businesses such as our broker-dealer and investment advisory services. Such inquiries or investigations may consume significant management time and result in regulatory sanctions, fines or other actions as well as significant legal fees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or information systems or if our information systems are breached.\nWe depend on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients. Cyber security breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We also are required at times to manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information. If any person, including any of our associates, fails to comply with, disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, accident, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our associates or third parties, could result in significant additional expenses (including expenses relating to notification of data security breaches and costs of credit monitoring services), negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation, as well as require substantial resources and effort of management, thereby diverting management\u2019s focus and resources from business operations.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\nShould we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer,\ntelecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, we could experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations.\nIn particular, our ability to recover from any disaster or other business continuity problem will depend on our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster.\nWe will continue to regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our business continuity plans. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.\nMaintaining a positive reputation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with clients and associates. Damage to our reputation could therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory action, failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures and unethical behavior. Negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects.\nWe could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.\nThe ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets related to the U.S. budget deficit, the European sovereign debt crisis and the state of the U.S. economic recovery may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nGlobal financial markets continue to experience disruptions, including increased volatility, and diminished liquidity and credit availability. In particular, developments in Europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations. This debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European clients and reducing the translation of Euro based revenues into U.S. dollars. For the year ended June 30, 2015, approximately 13% of our revenues were derived from countries which use the Euro as their primary currency. In the event that one or more countries were to replace the Euro with their legacy currency, then the Company\u2019s sales in and to such countries, or Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates were established. In addition, the European crisis is contributing to instability in global credit markets. If global economic and market conditions, or economic and financial market conditions in Europe, the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain, persist, or deteriorate further, our clients may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their expenditures, which may adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nThe loss of key associates could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and could result in such associates competing against Towers Watson.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including key managers and associates. In addition, our success largely depends upon our associates\u2019 abilities to generate business and provide quality services. In particular, our associates\u2019 business relationships with our clients are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements. If we lose associates who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise or if we are unable to successfully attract new talent, it could materially adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects. In addition, if any of our key associates were to join a competitor or form a competing company, existing and potential clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of Towers Watson\u2019s services.\nOver time, the trend of employers shifting from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur retirement consulting and actuarial business comprises a substantial portion of our revenue and profit. We provide clients with actuarial and consulting services relating to both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Defined benefit pension plans generally require more actuarial services than defined contribution plans because defined benefit plans typically involve large asset pools, complex calculations to determine employer costs, funding requirements and sophisticated analysis to\nmatch liabilities and assets over long periods of time. If organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate, or if we are unable to otherwise compensate for the decline in our business that results from employers moving away from defined benefit plans, our business operations and related results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks of doing business internationally.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2015, 44% of our revenue relates to business located outside the United States. As a result, a significant portion of our business operations is subject to foreign financial, tax and business risks, which could arise in the event of:\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nUnexpected increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws;\n\u2022\nCompliance with a variety of international laws and regulations, such as data privacy, employment regulations, trade barriers and restrictions on the import and export of technologies, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar foreign laws such as the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nAbsence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nNew regulatory requirements or changes in policies and local laws that materially affect the demand for our services or directly affect our foreign operations;\n\u2022\nLocal economic and political conditions, including unusual, severe, or protracted recessions in foreign economies and inflation risk;\n\u2022\nThe length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, particularly in light of the number of insolvencies in the current economic environment and the numerous bankruptcy laws to which they are subject;\n\u2022\nUnusual and unexpected monetary exchange controls, price controls or restrictions on transfers of cash; or\n\u2022\nCivil disturbance, terrorism or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity in other parts of the world.\nThese factors may lead to decreased revenues or profits and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients could terminate or reduce our services at any time, which could decrease associate utilization, adversely impacting our profitability and results of operations.\nOur clients generally are able to terminate or reduce our engagements at any time. If a client reduces the scope of, or terminates the use of, our services with little or no notice, our associate utilization will decline. In such cases, we will need to rapidly re-deploy our associates to other engagements (if possible) in order to minimize the potential negative impact on our financial performance. In addition, because a sizeable portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature, our associate utilization will depend on our ability to continually secure additional engagements.\nOur quarterly revenues could fluctuate while our expenses are relatively fixed.\nQuarterly variations in our revenues and results of operations have occurred in the past and could occur as a result of a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nThe significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter;\n\u2022\nThe seasonality of certain types of services. For example, our retirement revenues typically are more heavily weighted toward the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, when annual actuarial valuations are required to be completed for calendar year-end companies and the related services are performed;\n\u2022\nThe number of business days in a quarter;\n\u2022\nAssociate hiring and utilization rates;\n\u2022\nClients\u2019 ability to terminate engagements without penalty;\n\u2022\nThe size and scope of assignments; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions.\nA sizeable portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed, encompassing the majority of administrative, occupancy, communications and other expenses, depreciation and amortization, and salaries and employee benefits excluding fiscal year-end incentive bonuses. Therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the\ncompletion of client assignments or our inability to forecast demand can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results and could result in losses and volatility in our stock price.\nImproper management of our engagements could hurt our financial results.\nMost of our contracts are structured on a fixed-fee basis or a time-and-expense basis. The profitability of our fixed-fee engagements depends on our ability to correctly estimate the costs and timing required for completion of the engagements and our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. The profitability of the engagements that are priced on a time-and-expense basis depends on our ability to maintain competitive billing rates, as well as our ability to control our costs. If we do not correctly estimate the costs and manage the performance of our engagements, we may incur losses on individual engagements and experience lower profit margins and, as a result, our overall financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government regulations or if government regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs.\nA material portion of our revenue is affected by statutory changes. Many areas in which we provide services are the subject of government regulation, which is constantly evolving. Changes in government and accounting regulations in the United States and the United Kingdom, two of our principal geographic markets, affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human capital programs, including recent changes in regulations relating to health care (such as medical plans), defined contribution plans (such as 401(k) plans), defined benefit plans (such as pension plans) or executive compensation, may materially adversely affect the demand for, or the profitability of, our services. In addition, more restrictive rules or interpretations of the federal Centers for Medicare Services marketing rules, or judicial decisions that restrict or otherwise change existing provisions of U.S. healthcare regulation, could have a material adverse impact on our Exchange Solutions business. Further, changes to insurance regulatory schemes, or our failure to keep pace with such changes, could negatively affect demand for services in our Risk and Financial Services business segment. For example, our continuing ability to provide investment advisory services depends on compliance with the rules and regulations in each of these jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to disciplinary action, including compensating clients for loss, the imposition of fines or the revocation of the authorization to operate as well as damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, we have significant operations throughout the world, which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the United States and the United Kingdom. Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators in particular countries, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could require operational improvements or modifications, which may result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business in those countries.\nIf we are unable to adapt our services to applicable laws and regulations, our ability to provide effective services in these areas will be substantially diminished.\nOur business could be negatively affected by recently enacted or future legislative or regulatory activity concerning compensation consultants.\nRecent legislative and regulatory activity in the United States has focused on the independence of compensation consultants retained to provide advice to compensation committees of publicly traded companies. In 2009, the SEC published final rules, which became effective in 2010, with respect to issuer disclosures on compensation consultants. Among other requirements, the rules require disclosure of fees paid to compensation consultants as well as a description of any additional services provided to the issuer by the compensation consultant and its affiliates and the aggregate fees paid for such services. Due in part to this regulation and continued legislative activity, prior to the Towers Perrin | Watson Wyatt Merger, some clients of Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt and, after the Towers Perrin | Watson Wyatt Merger, some clients of Towers Watson decided to terminate their relationships with the respective company (either with respect to compensation consulting services or with respect to other consulting services) to avoid perceived or potential conflicts of interest.\nIn addition, in 2010, the U.S. President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires the SEC to issue rules directing national securities exchanges and associations to require the compensation committee of a listed company to consider the independence of an advisor when selecting a compensation consultant. The SEC was also required to identify factors affecting independence.\nIn 2012, the SEC issued final rules to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to the role of, and certain disclosure relating to, compensation consultants. The final rules require the national security exchanges to adopt listing standards requiring a company\u2019s compensation committee to consider certain independence factors, including whether the compensation consultant\u2019s firm provides other services to the company, before selecting a compensation consultant. These rules also require a company to disclose in its proxy statement whether its compensation committee has retained or obtained the\nadvice of a compensation consultant, whether the work of the compensation consultant raised any conflicts of interest, and if so, the nature of the conflicts and how any such conflicts are being addressed.\nIn January 2013, the SEC approved new listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and The Nasdaq Stock Market consistent with the final SEC rules and which require the compensation committee to consider the independence of advisors, including compensation consultants, as described above. Effective July 1, 2013, listed companies\u2019 compensation committees are not permitted to select, or receive advice from, an adviser unless the compensation committee has conducted the independence assessment that the new listing standards require.\nThe final rules and the newly-adopted listing standards do not require that the selected compensation consultant be independent, only that the compensation committee considers independence before selecting a compensation consultant. However, if companies\u2019 compensation committees elect to engage compensation consultants that do not perform any other services for the company, then this could cause additional clients to terminate their relationships with Towers Watson (either with respect to compensation consulting services or with respect to other consulting services) to avoid perceived or potential conflicts of interest. If this happens, the future termination of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, due in part to such regulation and continued legislative activity, some former Towers Perrin, Watson Wyatt or Towers Watson consultants terminated their relationships with us, and many have begun to compete with us or have indicated that they intend to compete with us. Such talent migration, and any future such talent migration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition could result in loss of our market share and reduced profitability.\nThe markets for our principal services are highly competitive. Our competitors include other human capital and risk management consulting and actuarial firms, as well as the human capital and risk management divisions of diversified professional services, insurance, brokerage and accounting firms. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us, which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and respond more quickly to professional and technological changes. Some competitors have or may develop a lower cost structure, or have more tax-efficient operations. New competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, creating additional competition and gaining significant market share, resulting in a loss of business for us and a corresponding decline in revenues and profit margin. In order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower our prices, which would also have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin.\nConsolidation in the industries that we serve could materially adversely affect our business.\nCompanies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. If two or more of our clients merge or consolidate and combine their operations, we may experience a decrease in the amount of services we perform for these clients. If one of our clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work. The increased market power of larger companies could also increase pricing and competitive pressures on us. Any of these possible results of industry consolidation could materially adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to make acquisitions, and if we have difficulty in acquiring, overpay for, or are unable to acquire other businesses, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions. We may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms acceptable or favorable to us, on the proposed timetables, or at all. We also face additional risks related to acquisitions, including that we could overpay for acquired businesses and that any acquired business could significantly underperform relative to our expectations. If we are unable to identify and successfully make acquisitions, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks when we acquire or divest businesses, and may have difficulty integrating or managing acquired businesses, or with effecting internal reorganizations, which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nWe may acquire other companies or divest certain businesses in the future. We cannot be certain that our acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or that our acquisitions or divestitures will otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations. Acquisitions involve special risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, and acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit or productivity we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect. In addition, if the operating performance of an acquired business\ndeteriorates significantly, we may need to write down the value of the goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet.\nWe may be unable to effectively integrate an acquired business into our organization, and may not succeed in managing such acquired businesses or the larger company that results from such acquisitions. The process of integration of an acquired business may subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nDiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\nAmortization of intangible assets, adversely affecting our reported results of operations;\n\u2022\nInability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nInability to establish uniform standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nInability to retain the acquired company\u2019s clients;\n\u2022\nExposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition; and\n\u2022\nIncurrence of additional expenses in connection with the integration process.\nWe may also face similar challenges in effecting internal reorganizations, such as the internal reorganization of our Exchange Solutions segment that began in 2014. If acquisitions or internal reorganizations are not successfully integrated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, as well as our professional reputation.\nWe advise or act on behalf of clients regarding investments whose results are not guaranteed, and clients that experience investment return shortfalls may assert claims against us.\nWe provide advice on both asset allocation and selection of investment managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on both these matters, or we may serve in a fiduciary capacity. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance, and investment managers may underperform their benchmarks; in both cases the investment return shortfall can be significant. Clients experiencing this underperformance may assert claims against us, and such claims may be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs. Our ability to limit our potential liability may be limited in certain jurisdictions or in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary duties or other alleged errors or omissions.\nOur investment activities may require specialized operational competencies, and if we fail to properly execute our role in cash and investment management, our clients or third parties may assert claims against us.\nFor certain clients, we are responsible for some portions of cash and investment management, including rebalancing of investment portfolios and guidance to third parties on structure of derivatives and securities transactions. Our failure to properly execute our role can cause monetary damage to our clients or such third parties for which we might be found liable, and such claims may be for significant amounts. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs. Our ability to limit our potential liability may be constrained in certain jurisdictions.\nTowers Watson is engaged in providing services and products outside the core human capital and risk management businesses previously conducted by the Company, which may carry greater risk of liability and regulatory action.\nWe continue to grow the business of providing professional services and products to institutional investors, financial services companies and other clients. The risk of claims from these lines of business and related products and services may be greater than from our core human capital and risk management business, and such claims may be for significant amounts. For example, we may assist a pension plan to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates. If the hedge does not perform as expected, we could be exposed to claims. Contractual provisions intended to mitigate risk may not be enforceable. Other examples of recently implemented ventures that may increase our exposure to client and regulator claims include pooled investment solutions in various jurisdictions in our Investment line of business; new licensed work and expansion into new jurisdictions in our Health and Group Benefits line of business; and in our Retirement line of business, establishing and servicing structures to facilitate the funding of our clients' employee benefit plans. In addition, with respect to some of these new ventures, we may enter into arrangements that need to be examined to determine whether they fall under the variable interest entity (VIE) accounting guidance. The structure of such arrangements could require us to consolidate assets or liabilities on which we do not have risk of loss.\nOur business faces rapid technological change, and our failure to respond to this change quickly could materially adversely affect our business.\nTo remain competitive in the business lines in which we engage, we have to identify and offer the most current technologies and methodologies. In some cases, significant technology choices and investments are required. If we do not respond correctly, quickly or in a cost-effective manner, our business and results of operations might be harmed.\nThe effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business may require us to incur significant expenses and, in some cases, to implement these new technologies globally, particularly with respect to the integration activities that are ongoing in connection with the Towers Perrin | Watson Wyatt Merger. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly or effectively as our competitors, we could lose market share. We also could lose market share if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies than we will offer or develop.\nLimited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business, and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe cannot guarantee that trade secret, trademark and copyright law protections are adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property (including our software, which may become an increasingly important part of our business). Existing laws of some countries in which we provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. Redressing infringements may consume significant management time and financial resources. Also, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take the necessary steps to enforce our rights, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot be sure that our services and products, or the products of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or our clients. These claims may harm our reputation, result in financial liability and prevent us from offering some services or products.\nInsurance may become more difficult or expensive to obtain.\nThe availability, terms and price of insurance are subject to many variables, including general insurance market conditions, loss experience in related industries and in the actuarial and benefits consulting industry, and the specific claims experience of an individual firm. We are subject to various regulatory requirements relating to insurance as well as client requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance at cost-effective rates or with reasonable retentions. Increases in the cost of insurance could affect our profitability and the unavailability of insurance to cover certain risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to transact business in certain geographic areas, particularly in any specific period.\nTowers Watson and its subsidiaries could encounter significant obstacles in securing adequate insurance coverage for errors and omissions liability risks on favorable or acceptable terms.\nTowers Perrin and Watson Wyatt each historically obtained primary insurance for errors and omissions liability risks from a Vermont-regulated group captive insurance company known as Professional Consultants Insurance Company, Inc. (which we refer to as \u201cPCIC\u201d). The stockholders and insureds of PCIC were legacy Towers Perrin, legacy Watson Wyatt and Milliman, Inc. (\u201cMilliman\u201d). On January 1, 2010, the effective date of the Towers Perrin | Watson Wyatt Merger, Towers Watson became the owner of 72.8% of the stock of PCIC.\nTowers Perrin and Watson Wyatt provided PCIC with notice of non-renewal of the respective PCIC policies of insurance that expired at 12:01 a.m. on July 1, 2010. PCIC provided a notice of non-renewal to Milliman and did not issue a policy of insurance to Milliman for the policy period starting July 1, 2010 or thereafter. PCIC continues to operate in Run-off in order to pay losses arising from claims reported by its insureds during the periods covered by previously issued policies of insurance.\nSince July 1, 2010, we have obtained our primary insurance for errors and omissions liability risks from a Vermont-regulated wholly owned captive insurance company known as Stone Mountain Insurance Company (\u201cStone Mountain\u201d). Stone Mountain has secured reinsurance for a portion of the Towers Watson risks it underwrites. Towers Watson has secured excess errors and omissions liability coverage above the coverage provided by Stone Mountain in amounts we consider to be prudent. Stone Mountain has issued a policy of insurance to us that is substantially similar in form to the policy of insurance issued by PCIC.\nThe combination of the formation of Stone Mountain, which results in Towers Watson and Stone Mountain bearing the first $25 million of loss per claim and in the aggregate above the $1 million per claim self-insured retention, and our controlling ownership interest in PCIC and the accompanying requirement that we consolidate PCIC\u2019s financial results into our financial results is likely to result in increased earnings volatility for us. In addition, the inability of Stone Mountain to secure reinsurance or our inability to secure excess errors and omissions professional liability coverage in the future could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our financial condition or our ability to transact business in certain geographic areas, particularly in any specific period.\nWe have material pension liabilities that can fluctuate significantly.\nWe have material pension liabilities. The projected benefit obligation for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans at June 30, 2015 was $4.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion represented unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement liabilities. Movements in the interest rate environment, inflation or changes in other assumptions that are used for the estimates of our benefit obligations and other factors could have a material effect on the level of liabilities in these plans at any given time. These pension plans have minimum funding requirements that may require material amounts of periodic additional funding. Cash required to fund pension plans may have to be diverted from other corporate initiatives.\nOur Exchange Solutions business may be harmed if we lose our relationships with insurance carriers, fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers, become dependent upon a limited number of insurance carriers or fail to develop new carrier relationships.\nOur Exchange Solutions business typically enters into contractual agency relationships with insurance carriers that are non-exclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In many cases, insurance carriers also have the ability to amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally on short notice. Insurance carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new health insurance plans or may amend our agreements with them, for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons or because of a reluctance to distribute their products through our exchange platform. Insurance carriers may decide to rely on their own internal distribution channels, including traditional in-house agents, carrier websites or other sales channels, or to market their own plans, and, in turn, could limit or prohibit us from marketing their plans. For example, in August 2011, one of Exchange Solutions\u2019 largest insurance carrier partners discontinued the indirect distribution of Medicare supplement policies through all of their distribution vendors. As a result, our new Medicare supplement enrollments shifted to other insurance carriers that pay us lower commission rates on average. Insurance carriers may also choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular plans or may determine not to distribute insurance plans in individual markets in certain geographies or altogether. Additionally, if one of the insurance carriers with which we are associated violates the law or comes under scrutiny by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), CMS may impose sanctions on such carriers, resulting in a loss of supply of insurance plans that we are able to sell. The termination or amendment of our relationship with an insurance carrier could reduce the variety of health insurance plans we offer. We also could lose a source of, or be paid reduced commissions for, future sales and could lose renewal commissions for past sales. Our business could also be harmed if we fail to develop new carrier relationships or are unable to offer customers a wide variety of health insurance plans.\nThe private health insurance industry in the United States has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation over the past several years, resulting in a decrease in the number of insurance carriers. In the future, it may become necessary for us to offer insurance plans from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry evolve. For example, in fiscal year 2015, the top five carriers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 72% of our commission revenue in our Retiree & Access Exchanges business. Each of these insurance carriers may terminate our agreements with them, and, in some cases, as a result of the termination we may lose our right to receive future commissions for policies we have sold. Should our dependence on a smaller number of insurance carriers increase, whether as a result of the termination of carrier relationships, further insurance carrier consolidation or otherwise, we may become more vulnerable to adverse changes in our relationships with our carriers, particularly in states where we offer health insurance plans from a relatively small number of carriers or where a small number of insurance carriers dominate the market. The termination, amendment or consolidation of our relationship with our insurance carriers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges and developments in the health insurance system in the United States could harm our Exchange Solutions business.\nIn 2010, the Federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (\"PPACA\"), and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, (\"HCERA\"), which we refer to collectively as (\"Healthcare Reform\"). Our Exchange Solutions business depends upon the private sector of the United States insurance system, its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers\u2019 use of, and payment of commissions to, agents, brokers and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance plans. Healthcare Reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways.\nMany aspects of Healthcare Reform are not yet in effect or have only recently gone into effect. In addition, state governments have adopted, and will continue to adopt, changes to their existing laws and regulations in light of Healthcare Reform and related regulations. Future postponements of or changes to Healthcare Reform may not be beneficial to us.\nCertain key members of Congress have expressed a desire to withhold the funding necessary to implement Healthcare Reform as well as the desire to replace or amend all or a portion of Healthcare Reform. Any partial or complete repeal or amendment or implementation difficulties, or uncertainty regarding such events, could increase our costs of compliance, prevent or delay future adoption of our exchange platform, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. The implementation of Healthcare Reform could have negative effects on us, including:\n\u2022\nIncrease our competition;\n\u2022\nReduce or eliminate the need for health insurance agents and brokers or demand for the health insurance that we sell;\n\u2022\nDecrease the number of types of health insurance plans that we sell, as well as the number of insurance carriers offering such plans;\n\u2022\nCause insurance carriers to change the benefits and/or premiums for the plans they sell;\n\u2022\nCause insurance carriers to reduce the amount they pay for our services or change our relationship with them in other ways; or\n\u2022\nMaterially restrict our call center operations.\nAny of these effects could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the manner in which the Federal government and the states implement health insurance exchanges and the process for receiving subsidies and cost-sharing credits could substantially increase our competition and member turnover and substantially reduce the number of individuals who purchase insurance through us. Various aspects of Healthcare Reform could cause insurance carriers to limit the type of health insurance plans we are able to sell and the geographies in which we are able to sell them. In addition, the U.S. Congress has been charged with finding spending cuts, and such cuts are expected to include Medicare. If cuts are made to Medicare, there may be substantial changes in the types of health insurance plans we are able to sell. Changes in the law could also cause insurance carriers to exit the business of selling insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction, to eliminate certain categories of products or to attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower commissions. If insurance carriers decide to limit our ability to sell their plans or determine not to sell individual health insurance plans altogether, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nOur Consumer-Directed Accounts business is dependent upon the availability of tax-advantaged consumer-directed benefits to employers and employees and any diminution in, elimination of, or change in the availability of these benefits would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nOur Consumer-Directed Accounts business fundamentally depends on employer and employee demand for tax-advantaged Consumer-Directed Benefits, or CDBs. Any diminution in or elimination of the availability of CDBs for employees would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. In addition, incentives for employers to offer CDBs may also be reduced or eliminated by changes in laws that result in employers no longer realizing financial gain from the implementation of these benefits. If employers cease to offer CDB programs or reduce the number of programs they offer to their employees, the results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects of our Consumer-Directed Accounts business would also be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, if the payroll tax savings employers currently realize from their employees\u2019 utilization of CDBs become reduced or unavailable, employers may be less inclined to offer these programs to their employees. If the tax savings currently realized by employee participants by utilizing CDBs were reduced or unavailable, we expect employees would correspondingly reduce or eliminate their participation in such CDB plans. Any such reduction in employer or employee incentives would materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects of our Consumer-Directed Accounts business.\nWe may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe maintenance and growth of our business depends on our access to capital, which will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing. There can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur revolving credit facility and term loan contain a number of restrictive covenants that restrict our operations.\nThe Towers Watson $500 million revolving credit facility (\"Revolving Credit Facility\") and $250 million term loan (\"Term Loan\") contain a number of customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on Towers Watson, including restrictions that limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. These covenants include, among others, limitations (and in some cases, prohibitions) that, directly or indirectly, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nIncur liens or additional indebtedness (including guarantees or contingent obligations);\n\u2022\nEngage in mergers and other fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nSell or otherwise dispose of property or assets;\n\u2022\nPay dividends and other distributions; and\n\u2022\nChange the nature of our business.\nThe credit agreements also contain financial covenants that limit our interest expense and total debt relative to EBITDA.\nThe operating restrictions and financial covenants in our credit agreements do, and any future financing agreements may, limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will satisfy any such requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants, seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures. We may be unable to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative or additional financing at all, or on terms favorable to us.\nThe credit agreements specify several events of default, including non-payment, certain cross-defaults, certain bankruptcy events, covenant or representation breaches and certain changes in control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the credit agreements are expected to be able to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. We may not be able to repay all amounts due under the credit agreements in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and their failure to perform the services could harm our business.\nAs part of providing services to clients and managing our business, we rely on a number of third-party service providers. Our ability to perform effectively depends in part on the ability of these service providers to meet their obligations, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. The quality of our services could suffer or we could be required to incur unanticipated costs if our third-party service providers do not perform as expected or their services are disrupted. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.\nThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to stockholders and for corporate expenses. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and other payments to the Company, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock.\nFurther, the Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside the U.S. Since the majority of financing obligations as well as dividends to stockholders are made from the U.S., it is important to be able to access cash generated outside the U.S. Funds from the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are periodically repatriated to the U.S. via shareholder distributions and repayment of intercompany financing. A number of factors may arise that could limit our ability to repatriate funds or make repatriation cost prohibitive, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange rates and tax-related costs.\nIn the event we are unable to generate cash from our operating subsidiaries for any of the reasons discussed above, our overall liquidity could deteriorate.\nChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition, valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients, discretionary compensation, incurred but not reported liabilities, restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.\nOur accounting for our long-term outsourcing contracts requires using estimates and projections that may change over time. These changes may have a significant or adverse effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition.\nProjecting contract profitability on our long-term outsourcing contracts requires us to make assumptions and estimates of future contract results. All estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to change. In an effort to maintain appropriate estimates, we review each of our long-term outsourcing contracts, the related contract reserves and intangible assets on a regular basis. If we determine that we need to change our estimates for a contract, we will change the estimates in the period in which the determination is made. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may also evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles and other factors. Further, changes in assumptions, estimates or developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to long-term outsourcing contracts may change our initial estimates of future contract results. Application of, and changes in, assumptions, estimates and policies may adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe stock price of Class A common stock may be volatile.\nThe stock price of the Class A common stock may in the future be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of the Class A common stock may in the future fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of the Class A common stock include:\n\u2022\nGeneral market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the human capital and risk and financial management consulting industries and regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022\nActual or expected variations in our quarterly results of operations and in the quarterly results of operations of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nDifferences between actual results of operations and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nChanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nOperations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u2022\nAccounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions, dispositions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;\n\u2022\nSales of the Class A common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;\n\u2022\nIncurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nDilutive issuance of equity;\n\u2022\nRecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nLoss or gain of key clients;\n\u2022\nLitigation involving us, our general industry or both; and\n\u2022\nChanges in reserves for professional liability claims.\nThere can be no assurance that the stock price of the Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance.\nWe will only pay dividends if and when declared by our board of directors.\nAny determination to pay dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, rule or regulation, business and investment strategy, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If we do not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value.\nWe have various mechanisms in place that could prevent a change in control that a stockholder might favor.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder might favor. Our certificate of incorporation or bylaws:\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of preferred stock without fixed characteristics, which could be issued by our board of directors pursuant to a stockholder rights plan and deter a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nProvide that only the Chief Executive Officer, President or our board of directors may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nLimit business at special stockholder meetings to such business as is brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholder action by written consent, and require all stockholder actions to be taken at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nProvide our board of directors with exclusive power to change the number of directors;\n\u2022\nProvide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including new directorships, may only be filled by a resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in office;\n\u2022\nDo not opt out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations between a corporation and any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nRequire a supermajority vote for the stockholders to amend the bylaws; and\n\u2022\nProhibit any stockholder from presenting a proposal or director nomination at an annual stockholders\u2019 meeting unless such stockholder provides us with sufficient advance notice.", "PERMNO": 93223, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "TW.3"}
