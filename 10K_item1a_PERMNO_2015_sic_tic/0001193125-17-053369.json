RISK FACTORS\nFNB is subject to numerous risks, many of which are inherent to our business. As a financial services organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. For information about how our risk oversight and management process operates, see Item 7 of this Report, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management.\u201d The following discussion highlights specific risks that could affect us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Based on the information currently known, FNB believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Report. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nIf we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth, we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends.\nTo achieve our past levels of growth, we have focused on both organic growth and acquisitions. We may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the opening of new retail branches and the completion of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our internal growth. If we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth, we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends.\nOur results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and consumer loans, which generally bear a higher risk of non-payment and loss than certain other types of loans, such as one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.\nLending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, for various reasons, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u2022\ncredit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions which impact certain geographic markets or industries;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan; and\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral.\nGenerally, commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans present a greater risk of non-payment by a borrower than other types of loans. They typically involve larger loan balances and are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. The borrower\u2019s ability to repay usually depends on the successful operation of its business and income stream. In addition, some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us, which means that an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss. In the case of commercial and industrial loans,\ncollateral often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, which may not yield substantial recovery of principal losses incurred, and is susceptible to deterioration or other loss in advance of liquidation of such collateral. These types of loans, however, have historically driven the growth in our loan portfolio and we intend to continue our lending efforts for commercial and industrial products. At December 31, 2016, commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans comprised 45.7% of our loan portfolio. In addition to commercial loans, consumer loans (comprised of direct installment loans, indirect installment loans and consumer lines of credit) comprised 27.3% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. These loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. For additional information, see the Lending Activity section of \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, which is included in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract sufficient deposits to fund our anticipated loan growth and meet liquidity objectives.\nWe fund our loan growth primarily through deposits and customer repurchase agreements. Deposits and customer repurchase agreements are a low cost and stable source of funding for us. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions, as well as non-depositary competitors such as mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies, for deposits and customer repurchase agreements. To the extent that we are unable to attract and maintain sufficient levels of deposits and customer repurchase agreements to fund our loan growth and liquidity objectives, we may be subject to paying higher funding costs by raising interest rates that are paid on deposits and customer repurchase agreements. Higher funding costs would reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. We also could seek to raise additional funds through public or private financings, however, we can give no assurance that we would be able to obtain these funds on terms that are attractive to us.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we must further increase our provision for credit losses or if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to absorb actual losses.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses. We can give no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses. Excess loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding reporting date based on various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio. We periodically determine the amount of our allowance for credit losses based upon consideration of several quantitative and qualitative factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na regular review of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nhistorical loan loss experience;\n\u2022\nevaluation of non-performing loans;\n\u2022\ngeographic or industry concentrations;\n\u2022\nassessment of economic conditions and their effects on FNB\u2019s existing portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing loans; and\n\u2022\ngeographic or industry economic market conditions.\nThe level of the allowance for credit losses reflects the judgment and estimates of management regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, current fair value of the underlying collateral and other qualitative risk factors that may affect the loan. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and is based on factors that are susceptible to significant change. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers,\nnew information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional discussion relating to this matter, refer to the Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses section of \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, which is included in Item 7 of this Report.\nChanges in economic conditions and the composition of our loan portfolio could lead to higher loan charge-offs or an increase in our provision for credit losses and may reduce our net income.\nChanges in national and regional economic conditions, and in large metropolitan areas within our market, continue to impact our loan portfolios. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities we serve. Weakness in the market areas served by FNB could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because customers may not want or need our products or services; borrowers may not be able to repay their loans; the value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and the quality of our loan portfolio may decline. Any of the latter three scenarios could require us to charge-off a higher percentage of our loans and/or increase our provision for credit losses, which would reduce our net income.\nOur business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market rates and changes in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the UST and the FRB, have a direct impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which may not be able to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. Such scenarios may include the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that FNBPA can earn on assets and the interest that FNBPA may pay on liabilities, which impacts FNBPA\u2019s overall net interest income and profitability;\n\u2022\nsuch changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets;\n\u2022\nsuch changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products or services, including bank loans and deposit products and the subordinated notes offered at Regency offices;\n\u2022\nsuch changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risks and may decrease the profitability or increase the risk associated with such hedges; and\n\u2022\nmovements in interest rates also affect mortgage repayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\nThe monetary, tax and other policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies also have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the FRB influence the rates of interest that FNBPA may charge on loans and what FNBPA may pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of FNB\u2019s and FNBPA\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Principally due to the impact of rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the FRB, the FRB\u2019s policies also influence to a significant extent, FNBPA\u2019s cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing\nof future changes in monetary, fiscal, tax and other policies or the effects that may be implemented by the new Administration and that they may have on FNBPA\u2019s and other affiliates\u2019 activities and financial results.\nThe financial soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates are exposed to many different industries and counterparties and they routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these types of transactions expose FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty or client. In addition, FNBPA and other affiliates\u2019 credit risks may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that we are due.\nThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, testing, developing strategic planning initiatives, capital stress testing and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of such information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to our stockholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator\u2019s perception that the quality of the models used to generate our relevant information is insufficient.\nOur asset valuations may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and this, along with market factors such as volatility in one or more markets or industries, could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets are measured and reported at fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Because the assets are carried at fair value, a decline in their value may cause us to incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal risk. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party resources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relative inputs. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying these estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be more difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In such cases, valuations in certain asset classes may require more subjectivity and management discretion; valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market (e.g., credit, equity, fixed income) could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.\nWe may be required to record future impairment charges if the declines in asset values are considered other-than-temporary. If the impairment charges are significant enough, they could affect the ability of FNBPA to pay dividends to FNB (which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders), and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in FNBPA not being classified as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes.\nWe are subject to operational risk that could damage our reputation and our business. We engage in a variety of businesses in diverse markets and rely on systems, employees, service providers and counterparties to properly process a high volume of transactions.\nLike all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes in our systems, human error and external events. Operational risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of FNB\u2019s and our subsidiaries\u2019 noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. Many strategic initiatives, such as development of new products, product enhancements, use of technology, staffing reductions, changes in business processes and acquisitions of other financial services companies or their assets, could substantially increase operational risk. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect the changes in circumstances or capabilities of FNB\u2019s outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to FNB\u2019s business. We outsource certain of our data processing and online and mobile banking services to third party providers. Those third party providers could also be sources of operational and information security risk to FNB, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although we seek to mitigate operational risks through a system of internal controls which we regularly review and update, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible, and, to the extent the risks arise from the operations of third party vendors or customers, we have limited ability to control those risks. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risk could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, civil litigation, regulatory intervention or sanctions, foregone business opportunities, the loss of customer business, especially if customers are discouraged from using our mobile bill pay, mobile banking and online banking services, or the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary information.\nOur business could be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.\nWe operate primarily in Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, Maryland and northern West Virginia. Most of our customers are individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses that are dependent upon their regional economies. The economic conditions in these local markets may be different from, and in some instances worse than, economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Difficult economic and employment conditions in the market areas FNB serves could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our loans, deposits and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nweak economic conditions could limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers, limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may decline in value; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the\npreparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOf the newly issued guidance, the most significant to us is the FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as \u201cCECL,\u201d which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. This ASU introduces an expected losses approach for calculating credit reserves on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for debt securities available for sale and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. For further information, see Note 2, \u201cNew Accounting Standards\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the law, especially changes in the regulation of the banking industry.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our businesses are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental agencies, including the SEC, FRB, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FSOC and state regulatory and licensing agencies. Regulations are generally intended to provide protection for depositors, borrowers and other customers, as well as the stability of the financial services industry, rather than for investors in our securities. We are subject to changes in federal and state law, regulations, governmental policies, tax laws and accounting principles. Changes in regulations or the regulatory environment could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry as a whole and could limit our growth and the return to investors by restricting such activities as:\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nmergers with or acquisitions of other institutions or branches;\n\u2022\ninvestments;\n\u2022\nloans and interest rates;\n\u2022\nassessments of fees, such as overdraft and electronic transfer interchange fees;\n\u2022\nthe provision of securities, insurance, brokerage or trust services;\n\u2022\nthe types of non-deposit activities in which our subsidiaries may engage; and\n\u2022\noffering of new products and services.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, FNB and FNBPA must meet guidelines subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to those regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the Basel Committee on banking supervision and implemented by the FRB, when fully phased in, will likely require FNB to satisfy additional, more stringent and complex capital adequacy standards (see discussion under Business - Government Supervision and Regulation - \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d).\nThese changes to present capital and liquidity requirements could restrict our activities and require us to maintain additional capital. Compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations. If we fail to meet these minimum liquidity capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act effects fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry, some of which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes regulatory requirements and oversight over banks and other financial institutions in a number of ways, among which are: (i) created the CFPB to regulate consumer financial products and services\nsold by banks and non-banks, and to review their compliance with federal consumer protection unfair and deceptive practice standards and fair lending laws; (ii) created the FSOC to identify and impose stronger regulatory oversight on large financial firms and to identify systemic risks; (iii) granting orderly liquidation authority to the FDIC for the liquidation of financial corporations that pose a risk to the financial system of the U.S.; (iv) limiting debit card interchange fees; (v) adopting certain changes to stockholder rights, including a stockholder \u201csay on pay\u201d vote on executive compensation; (vi) strengthening the SEC\u2019s powers to regulate securities markets; (vii) regulating OTC derivative markets; (viii) making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; (ix) providing consumers a defense of set-off or recoupment in a foreclosure or collection action if the lender violates the newly created \u201creasonable ability to repay\u201d provision; (x) amending the Truth in Lending Act with respect to mortgage originations, including originator compensation, disallowing mandatory arbitration, and prepayment considerations; (xi) the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d which, among other things, imposes restrictions on proprietary trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies and restricts the sponsoring of hedge funds or private equity funds; (xii) reform related to the regulation of credit rating agencies; and (xiii) placing additional and sometimes more time consuming requirements on the process of foreclosing on residential mortgage loans in default.\nRegulators are tasked with adopting regulations that implement and define the breadth and scope of the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which have yet to be implemented. A number of the regulations that must be adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be proposed, and it is difficult to gauge the impact of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act because so many important details related to the concepts adopted in the Dodd-Frank Act were left within the sole discretion of the regulators. For example, the CFPB has the power to adopt new regulations, such as the QM Rule, to protect consumers, which power it may exercise at its discretion so long as it advances the general concept of the protection of consumers.\nConsequently, the full impact of these regulations and other regulations to be adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act remains unclear, but they may impair our ability to meet all of the product needs of our customers, lead customers to seek financial solutions and products through non-banking channels and adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, the increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act regulations will likely continue to increase our cost of compliance, divert our resources and may adversely affect profitability.\nAmong those regulations that have been proposed or adopted, the following may adversely affect our business:\n\u2022\nlimitations on debit card interchange fees may adversely affect our revenues and earnings;\n\u2022\nchanging the methodology for calculating deposit insurance premium rates will become more complex, less predictable and more pro-cyclical, diverting our resources and potentially having a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nchanging the procedures for liquidation may adversely impact our credit ratings and adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition, and our ability to adequately fund our activities;\n\u2022\nincreases in requirements for regulatory capital while eliminating certain sources of capital may adversely affect our financial condition and ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nthe ability to pay interest on commercial demand deposit accounts may increase our interest expenses; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty as to the types of activities which may be deemed unfair and deceptive practices which may impact fee income opportunities.\nThese provisions may limit the types of products we are able to offer, the methods of offering them and prices at which they are offered. They may also increase the cost of offering these products. These provisions likely will affect different financial institutions in different ways, and therefore, may also affect the competitive landscape.\nIncreases in or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings.\nIn order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC has increased assessment rates of insured institutions. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF\nwas increased from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, or the assessment base, and the FDIC was directed to take the steps needed to cause the reserve ratio of the DIF to reach 1.35% of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020. As part of its long-range management plan to ensure that the DIF is able to maintain a positive balance despite banking crises and steady, moderate assessment rates despite economic and credit cycles, the FDIC set the DIF\u2019s designated reserve ratio (DRR) at 2% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is required to offset the effect of the increased minimum reserve ratio for banks with assets of less than $10 billion, so smaller community banks will be spared the cost of funding the increase in the minimum reserve ratio.\nHistorically, the FDIC utilized a risk-based assessment system that imposed insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account several components, including but not limited to the bank\u2019s capital level and supervisory rating. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended its regulations to base insurance assessments on the average consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period; to set deposit insurance assessment rates in light of the new assessment base; and to revise the assessment system applicable to large banks (those having at least $10 billion in total assets) to better differentiate for the risks that a large bank could pose to the DIF.\nThe likely effect of the new assessment scheme will be to increase assessment fees for institutions that rely more heavily on non-deposit funding sources. However, the higher assessments for institutions that have relied on non-deposit sources of funding in the past could force these institutions to change their funding models and more actively search for deposits. If this happens, it could drive up the costs to attain deposits across the market, a situation that would negatively impact community banks like FNBPA, which derive the majority of their funding from deposits.\nWe generally will be unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future increases in or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In light of the recent increases in the assessment rates, the potential for additional increases, and our status as a large bank, FNBPA may be required to pay additional amounts to the DIF, which could have an adverse effect on our earnings. If FNBPA\u2019s deposit insurance premium assessment rate increases again, either because of our risk classification, because of emergency assessments, or because of another uniform increase, our earnings could be further adversely impacted.\nWe must comply with stress-testing requirements.\nThe stress testing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act stipulate that all U.S. banks and bank holding companies with consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion are required to conduct annual stress tests calculated under a multi-scenario analysis (see discussion under Business - Government Supervision and Regulation - \u201cStress Testing\u201d).\nThe economic and financial market scenarios used in the annual company-run stress test include baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios. Each scenario includes numerous variables, including economic activity, unemployment, exchange rates, prices, incomes and interest rates. The adverse and severely adverse scenarios are not forecasts, but rather hypothetical scenarios designed to assess the strength and resilience of financial institutions under severe economic conditions. If we fail to meet these stress-test requirements, we could be required to take certain actions, including raising additional capital. The results of the stress test could also impact the FRB\u2019s decision-making regarding future dividend payments, as well as acquisitions and new business activities by FNB.\nAn interruption in or breach in security of our information systems may result in a loss of customer business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information in both paper and electronic form and rely heavily on communications and information systems for these\nfunctions. Additionally, certain of these data processing functions are not handled by us directly, but are outsourced to third party providers. We devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems, including adoption of policies and plans that involve our third party providers to detect and deter cyber-related crimes intended to infiltrate our networks, capture sensitive client and customer information, deny service to customers, or harm electronic processing capabilities. Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses or compromises, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential business, employee or customer information, whether originating with us, our vendors or retail businesses, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of civil litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, cyber-security risks appear to be growing. In the last few years, there have been an increasing number of cyber incidents, including several well-publicized cyber-attacks that targeted other U.S. companies, including financial services companies much larger than us. As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has also become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points, some of which are not controlled or secured by FNB. It is possible that we could have exposure to liability and suffer losses as a result of a security breach or cyber-attack that occurred through no fault of FNB. Although we maintain specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, many of which may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. As cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to spend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective and preventative measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually encounters technological change, especially in the systems that are used to deliver products to, and execute transactions on behalf of, customers, and if we fail to continue to invest in technological improvements as they become appropriate or necessary, our ability to compete effectively could be severely impaired.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address customer needs by using secure technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or do so as quickly as our competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking and financial services industry could negatively affect our revenue and profitability.\nOur day-to-day operations rely heavily on the proper functioning of products, information systems and services provided by third-party, external vendors.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products, information systems and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to provide services. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources\nof operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to continue to recruit and retain qualified banking professionals could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully and affect our profitability.\nOur continued success and future growth depends heavily on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated banking professionals. We compete against many institutions with greater financial resources both within our industry and in other industries to attract these qualified individuals. Our failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe could experience significant difficulties and complications in connection with future growth through acquisitions.\nWe have grown significantly over the last few years, including through acquisitions, and may continue to seek growth by acquiring financial institutions and branches as well as non-depository entities engaged in permissible activities for our financial institution subsidiaries. However, the market for acquisitions is highly competitive. We may not be as successful as we anticipate in identifying financial institutions and branch acquisition candidates, integrating acquired institutions or preventing deposit erosion at acquired institutions or branches. Even if we are successful with this strategy, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage this growth adequately and profitably. For example, acquiring any bank or non-bank entity will involve risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities, including fraud, of banks and non-bank entities that we acquire;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues of acquired banks and non-bank entities due to different underwriting standards that may have been employed by the predecessor entities;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\npotential diversion of the time and attention of our management;\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and other businesses that we acquire; and\n\u2022\npotential dilution of our current stockholders\u2019 ownership to the extent that we issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, as well as difficulties and complications in integrating expanded operations and new employees without disruption to our overall operations. Following each acquisition, we must expend substantial resources to integrate the entities. The integration of non-banking entities often involves combining different industry cultures and business methodologies. The failure to integrate acquired entities successfully with our existing operations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As we grow, our regulatory costs also may become more significant.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by undertaking additional de novo branch openings. Based on our experience, we believe that it generally takes up to three years for new banking facilities to achieve operational profitability due to the impact of organizational and overhead expenses and the start-up phase of generating loans and deposits. To the extent that we undertake additional de novo branch openings or branch acquisitions, we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new banking facilities, which may have an adverse effect on our net income, earnings per share, return on average stockholders\u2019 equity and return on average assets.\nOur growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations (see the \u201cGovernment Supervision and Regulation\u201d section included in Item 1 of this Report). As a financial holding company, we seek to maintain capital sufficient to meet the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standard set by regulators. We anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support continued growth, whether such growth occurs organically or through acquisitions.\nThe availability of additional capital or financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, marketability of our stock, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of business activity decreases due to economic conditions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance of our ability to expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than desired or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, it could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nOur key assets include our brand and reputation and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the market place.\nOur brand and our reputation are key assets of FNB. Our ability to attract and retain banking, insurance, consumer finance, wealth management and corporate clients and employees is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our level of service, security, trustworthiness, business practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing customers and corporate clients and employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends to stockholders.\nWe are a holding company and conduct almost all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We do not have any significant assets other than cash and the stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders. Our right to participate in any distribution of earnings or assets of our subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries. Under federal law, the amount of dividends that a national bank, such as FNBPA, may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of our net income for the current year combined with our retained net income for the two preceding years. The OCC has the authority to prohibit FNBPA from paying dividends if it determines such payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Likewise, FNB\u2019s state-based entities are subject to state laws governing dividend practices and payments.\nRegulatory authorities may restrict our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock.\nDividends on our common stock will be payable only if, when and as authorized and declared by our board of directors. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases. For example, our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, is subject to the review and non-objection of\nour annual capital plan by the FRB. In certain circumstances, we will not be able to make a capital distribution unless the FRB has approved such distribution, including if the dividend could not be fully funded by our net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid), our prospective rate of earnings retention appears inconsistent with our capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, or we will not be able to continue meeting minimum required capital ratios. As a bank holding company, we also are required to consult with the FRB before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Additionally, the FRB could prohibit or limit our payment of dividends if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future.\nWe have outstanding securities senior to the common stock which could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have outstanding TPS and Series E preferred stock that are senior to the common stock and could adversely affect our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on our common stock. The terms of the TPS prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or making distributions on our junior capital stock, including the common stock, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on any junior capital stock, if: (1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the junior subordinated debentures underlying the TPS, (2) we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related TPS or (3) we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments, but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. We also would be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period have been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of the Series E preferred stock. If we experience a material deterioration in our financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, our regulators may not permit us to make future payments on our TPS or preferred stock, which would also prevent us from paying any dividends on our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and Pennsylvania law may discourage takeovers.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may discourage or may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our Board of Directors. In particular, our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws:\n\u2022\nrequire shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\npermit our Board of Directors to issue, without approval of our common shareholders unless otherwise required by law, preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine;\n\u2022\nrequire the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our By-laws;\n\u2022\nin the case of a proposed business combination with a shareholder owning 10% or more of the voting shares of FNB, the vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting shares not owned by such shareholder is required to approve the business combination, unless it is approved by a majority of FNB\u2019s disinterested directors.\nUnder Pennsylvania law, only shareholders holding at least 25% of a corporation\u2019s outstanding stock may call a special meeting for any purpose. In addition, Pennsylvania law provides that in discharging their duties, including in the context of a takeover attempt, the board of directors, committees of the board and individual directors may consider a broad range of factors as they deem pertinent, which may include but is not limited to shareholders\u2019 interests, in considering the best interests of the corporation.\nThese provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and of Pennsylvania law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though the holders of a\nmajority of our stock may consider such proposals desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers, including tender offers at prices above the then-current market price of our common stock, and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Pending YDKN Acquisition\nCombining FNB and YDKN may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger with YDKN may not be realized.\nFNB and YDKN have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently from each other. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of FNBPA and Yadkin Bank within our projected timeframe in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers.\nA number of factors could affect our ability to successfully combine our business with YDKN\u2019s. Conversion of core data systems is expected to be more challenging than in prior acquisitions because we will need to convert two separate core data systems: YDKN\u2019s own core data systems and those of NewBridge Bancorp, which was acquired by YDKN in March 2016 and whose core data systems have not yet been converted to YDKN\u2019s core systems. Key employees of YDKN, whose services will be needed to complete the integration process, may elect to terminate their employment as a result of, or in anticipation of, the merger. The integration process itself could be disruptive to ours or YDKN\u2019s ongoing businesses, causing loss of momentum in one or more of their businesses or inconsistencies or changes in standards, practices, business models, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees. If we encounter significant difficulties in the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger in the projected timeframes could result in increased costs and decreased revenues. This could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s earnings per share.\nIf the merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the proposed merger with YDKN, which are charged to earnings as incurred. If the merger is not completed, these expenses will still be charged to earnings even though we would not have realized the expected benefits of the merger.\nTermination of the merger agreement could negatively impact our prospects and stock price.\nIf the merger agreement with YDKN is terminated, there may be various adverse consequences to FNB. For example, we may have failed to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger with YDKN without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger, and there can be no assurance that we would be successful in competing with other financial institutions for other potential acquisition candidates. Additionally, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.\nRegulatory approvals for the merger may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nBefore the merger between FNB and YDKN and the merger between their bank subsidiaries may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from bank regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, including\nthe FRB and the OCC. These governmental entities may not grant approval of either the merger or the bank merger, may engage in an extended regulatory review process, or may impose conditions on the granting of their approvals. The regulatory delays, conditions or changes they impose, as well as the process of obtaining regulatory approvals, could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following the merger. We may elect not to consummate the merger if, in connection with any regulatory approval required to consummate the merger, any governmental or regulatory entity imposes a restriction, requirement or condition on us that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the desired regulatory approvals for the merger will be obtained or that the merger will be completed.\nWe may be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could result in loss of key employees or customers.\nUncertainties about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us, as well as YDKN. These uncertainties may impair our or YDKN\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us or YDKN to consider changing their existing business relationships with us or YDKN. Retention of employees while the merger is pending may be challenging, as they may experience uncertainty about their future roles. Departure of key employees and loss of customers could negatively affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in YDKN\u2019s market area or in specialty lending areas that are part of YDKN\u2019s business.\nWe have no prior operating experience in YDKN\u2019s market area (North Carolina and South Carolina). YDKN\u2019s market area also is geographically remote from our existing market areas, and is a more competitive market environment than our primary markets in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio. Our success in YDKN\u2019s market will depend, in part, on our ability to enter YDKN\u2019s markets with products and services that YDKN does not currently offer, such as asset-based lending, wealth management and private banking. This business strategy will require us to attract and retain qualified and experienced personnel in YDKN\u2019s markets to support those new products and services. Competition for qualified personnel may be intense, and we may be unable to recruit these individuals away from other banks and financial institutions, or may be unable to do so at a reasonable cost. YDKN also engages in certain specialty lending areas, such as Small Business Administration lending, in which we have not developed comparable expertise, and we must rely on YDKN\u2019s existing teams of bankers to maintain and expand those lending areas. Although we will seek to retain key YDKN employees following the completion of the merger, including certain members of YDKN\u2019s senior management, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to retain those employees. Moreover, the geographic distance between YDKN\u2019s markets and our primary markets, as well as the lack of awareness of our brand in YDKN\u2019s market area, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and our overall ability to operate successfully and compete in this new market area. We could lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers in this new market, may not adequately address our new market in terms of the products and services offered, and may fail to compete successfully with financial institutions already established within this market area.\nThe merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of FNB\u2019s common stock.\nWe currently expect the merger to be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing (excluding one-time charges). This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change, including the currently expected timing of the merger. We may encounter additional transaction- and integration-related costs or other factors such as a delay in the closing of the merger, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or may be subject to other factors that affect preliminary\nestimates or our ability to realize operational efficiencies. Any of these factors could cause a decrease in our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 10629, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNB"}
