Risk Factors\nIf any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards may be limited or they may expire before utilization.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had United States federal tax net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $119.4 million, which expire at various dates from fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2033. These net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our United States federal income taxes otherwise payable. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to use its net operating loss carry forwards to reduce its tax liability. If a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d and fails to continue its business enterprise during the two year period, beginning on the change date, the annual limitation is zero. An \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if stockholders, deemed under Section 382 of the Code to own 5% or more of our capital stock by value, increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our capital stock to more than 50 percentage points over a defined period of time. In the event of certain changes in our stockholder base, we may at some point in the future experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Accordingly, our use of the NOLs and credit carryforwards may be limited at some point in the future by the annual limitations (including a limitation of zero) described in Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.\nWe have no operations and minimal assets, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to return any additional value to our stockholders.\nWe no longer have operations and as a result of the Asset Sale, we have very limited assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to return any additional value to our stockholders. While we will continue to look for opportunities to exploit the expertise of our management staff as time and financial resources allow (primarily through a corporate transaction/merger opportunity), there is no guarantee that we will we be able to successful in our efforts. If we are not successful, our management and the board of directors may determine it to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to dissolve the Company and terminate its existence. We believe that we could begin to proceed with a dissolution of the Company as early as the third quarter of 2015, if we have not consummated or entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a corporate transaction/merger at or prior to such time, and we may begin such process earlier if we believe that we cannot enter into a corporate transaction/merger on terms acceptable to us, or at all, although there are no assurances that we will do so at any time. To facilitate this process, we are considering submitting to our stockholders for approval a proposal at our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders for the dissolution of the Company and a related plan of dissolution pursuant to which the Company will be dissolved if we cannot consummate a corporate transaction/merger.\nThe terms of our outstanding Preferred Stock provide that the holders of the Preferred Stock would be entitled to a liquidation preference before the holders of our Common Stock would be entitled to receive any of the consideration in a distribution of remaining assets in the event of dissolution. Currently, the liquidation preference to which the holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled totals approximately $68 million in the aggregate, which is more than the excess net proceeds received from the Asset Sale and our other assets. In addition, it would be unlikely that holders of the Preferred Stock would vote in favor of any corporate merger/transaction unless all or a significant portion of the value resulting from such a transaction (at least an amount equal to the Preferred Stock liquidation preference) is ascribed to the Preferred Stock. Therefore, absent a concession from the holders of our Preferred Stock, the holders of our Common Stock will not receive any consideration in a liquidation or dissolution or possibly in a corporate transaction/merger in lieu thereof (which may also result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders).\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement and our prior CBM operations may expose us to contingent liabilities.\nAlthough we sold substantially all of our assets, the purchasers of those assets, including the Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement, did not assume all of our pre-closing liabilities with respect to those assets or past operations as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, although general representations and related indemnifications had a 90 day term from the date of closing and therefore are \u201cnon-surviving representations,\u201d fundamental representations under the Asset Purchase Agreement have a 1 year survival period from date of closing and therefore will expire in May 2015. As a result, we may be required to incur costs and expenses related to such assets or operations that were not otherwise assumed by the buyers of the assets or under our remaining indemnity obligations to the Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nWe may be exposed to litigation from the holders of our Common Stock.\nBecause the holders of our Common Stock did not receive any consideration from the Asset Sale and may not receive any consideration in another subsequent transaction or as a result of our liquidation or dissolution (and/or be significantly diluted in a future transaction), it is possible that they may sue the Company or its board of directors.\nWe may be unable to retain our existing management team and/or key personnel and our failure to continue to retain qualified new personnel could adversely affect our business.\nIf we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of any of the remaining members of our management team, our business could be adversely affected. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in retaining the required personnel.\nGovernment laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment, health and safety matters and others that governed our business before the Asset Sale could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBefore the Asset Sale, we were subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the injection of material into subsurface formations, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining or drilling properties after mining or drilling is completed, control of surface subsidence from underground mining, and work practices related to employee health and safety. Complying with these requirements, including the terms of our permits, had a significant effect on our respective costs of operations\nand competitive position. In addition, we could still potentially incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third party damage claims for personal injury, property damage, wrongful death, or exposure to hazardous substances, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and health and safety laws before the Asset Sale. Additionally, if we failed to comply with statutes and regulations prior to the Asset Sale, we still potentially may be subject to substantial penalties regarding various aspects of our prior gas drilling and production activities.\nWe do not insure against all potential risks. We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our natural gas operations before the Asset Sale.\nWe maintained insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some risks, we may not have obtained insurance if we believed the cost of available insurance was excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may have become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Although we maintained insurance at levels we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice, we were not and are not fully insured against all risks, including drilling and completion risks before the Asset Sale that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events before the Asset Sale and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nAbsent concessions from the holders of our Preferred Stock, the holders of our Common Stock will not receive any of cash in the event of liquidation.\nBased on the advice of management regarding potential business opportunities available to the Company, or the lack thereof, or the advice of the Company\u2019s tax, accounting, legal or other experts, our board of directors may, at any time, determine it to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to dissolve the Company and terminate its existence, which could occur as early as this year. In addition, while we continue to incur expenses, we do not currently generate any revenue nor do we expect to do so until such time as we can make an acquisition or exploit an opportunity that would allow us to generate revenue. There is no guarantee we will be able to do so. Similarly, there is no guarantee that if we were to identify an opportunity we would have sufficient funds then available to us to enable us to make an acquisition or exploit such an opportunity. Given our current situation, economic conditions could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain credit or access the capital markets to fund an acquisition or exploit a new business opportunity, which would make it very difficult to pursue a new opportunity, in which case we may dissolve and terminate our existence. Our remaining cash is approximately $23 million. Since the holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to an approximately $68 million liquidation preference, absent a concession from the holders of our Preferred Stock, no cash will be received by the holders of our Common Stock in a liquidation.\nThere is no guarantee that the holders of our Preferred Stock will receive any cash in the form of dividends, and we could spend or invest our cash and other assets in ways in which our stockholders may not agree.\nThe terms of our outstanding Preferred Stock provide that the holders of the Preferred Stock would be entitled to a liquidation preference before the holders of our Common Stock would be entitled to receive any of the consideration in a distribution of remaining assets in the event of dissolution. Currently, the liquidation preference to which the holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled totals approximately $68 million in the aggregate, which is more than the excess net proceeds received from the Asset Sale and our other assets. Therefore, in a liquidation or dissolution or in a corporate transaction/merger in lieu thereof (which may also result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders) holders of our Preferred Stock may only receive (or be valued at or receive consideration equivalent to) a portion of the liquidation preference to which they are entitled. Further, there is no guaranty that the Company will dissolve or the amount of assets available for distribution. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the holders of our Preferred Stock will receive any cash in the form of dividends or otherwise, and we could spend or invest our cash or other assets in ways which our stockholders may not agree.\nIf the existence of the Company is terminated, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock will cease to exist or trade on any market.\nWith the completion of the Asset Sale, management and the board of directors may at any time cease pursuing other opportunities (primarily through a corporate transaction/merger opportunity) and determine that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to dissolve the Company and terminate its existence. In the event the Company\u2019s existence is terminated, our Common Stock and Preferred Stock will cease to exist and there will be no market for our Common Stock or Preferred Stock. Since the holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to an approximately $68 million liquidation preference, absent a concession from the holders of our Preferred Stock such action would result in a complete loss in the value of the Common Stock.\nOn an as-converted basis, our Preferred Stock currently represents approximately 56% of the outstanding shares and therefore would have the ability to control any vote requiring the approval of our stockholders, voting together as a single class, and may take actions that conflict with the interests of the other stockholders.\nThe interests of the holders of Preferred Stock could conflict with your interests as a holder of Common Stock. For example, the holders of Preferred Stock may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you, as minority holders of the Company, including a vote to approve a dissolution of the Company.\nThe terms of our Preferred Stock prohibit us from issuing Common Stock at a price of less than the conversion price at the time of issuance without approval of a at least 50% of the holders of the Preferred Stock, which has and may continue to limit our ability to access the capital markets. We have granted certain rights to a holder of our Preferred Stock which has and may continue to limit certain of the transactions we may enter into.\nThe terms of our Preferred Stock provide that we may not issue any additional shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) for consideration per share (with regard to securities convertible into Common Stock, on an as-converted basis) less than the then-current conversion price of the Preferred Stock without the prior vote or consent of holders of a at least 50% of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, for so long as at least 750,000 shares of Preferred Stock remain outstanding. The current price of our Common Stock is significantly lower than the conversion price of our Preferred Stock. This provision has and will continue to prevent us from issuing Common Stock or securities convertible into our Common Stock for the foreseeable future, without the consent of the holders of our Preferred Stock, which has and may continue to adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn 2010, we entered into an agreement with Sherwood Energy LLC (\u201cSherwood\u201d) in connection with a rights offering of Preferred Stock to our stockholders in which Sherwood agreed to acquire any shares of Preferred Stock not acquired by our stockholders pursuant to the rights offering. Pursuant to this agreement, Sherwood is entitled to appoint up to two persons to our board of directors. In addition, without the consent of the Sherwood directors, we are prohibited from entering into certain corporate transactions. We also granted Sherwood the right to acquire additional securities that we may issue in the future, subject to the terms of the agreement. In addition, if we default under this agreement, Sherwood will have the right to appoint a majority of our directors, until the default is waived. If the default is not cured or waived within a year, Sherwood will have the right to require us to redeem the Preferred Stock it owns. See \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Preferred Stock.\u201d\nThe terms of our Preferred Stock has and may continue to prohibit us from obtaining long term financing or additional equity.\nThe terms of our Preferred Stock currently provide that we pay in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) dividends at 12.5% or in cash at a rate of 8% until September 14, 2015, at which time the cash dividend rate will increase to 9.6%. At such date, we will no longer have the option to pay these dividends in-kind. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends during the period it has the option to pay PIK dividends. The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the election of the preferred holders beginning eight years after the effective date of the Preferred Stock issuance. The cumulative impact of paying PIK dividends negatively impacts our ability to obtain equity because of the significant dilutive effects on our Common Stock. In addition, the 9.6% cash dividend may impede our ability to raise debt financing.\nOur Common Stock and Preferred Stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and a low trading volume.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations, which may result in losses to investors. Our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including:\n\u00b7 global economic conditions;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 acquisitions and financings;\n\u00b7 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; and\n\u00b7 issuances, purchases or sales of blocks of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\nThis volatility may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock regardless of our performance.\nAn existing stockholder beneficially owns a significant percentage of our Common Stock, which has and may continue to limit your ability to influence the outcome of stockholder votes.\nSherwood beneficially owns approximately 33% of our Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014 (after giving effect to the conversion of the Preferred Stock held by Sherwood). Additional shares of our Preferred Stock may be issued to Sherwood and our other holders of our Preferred Stock as PIK dividends. In addition, one of the current members of our board of directors is appointed by Sherwood, and our current Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sherwood. As a result, Sherwood has, and can be expected to have, a significant voice in our affairs, in the outcome of stockholder voting concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter and bylaws, the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional equity securities.\nWe may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue 125,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with such designations, preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2014, 40,513,373 shares of Common Stock were outstanding, and 52,202,569 shares of Common Stock are issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock. An additional 615,498 shares of our Preferred Stock, convertible into 4,734,600 shares of Common Stock, are reserved for issuance and some or all of that amount may be issued to our holders of our Preferred Stock as PIK dividends. The potential issuance of such additional securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We may also issue additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock, in connection with the hiring of personnel, future acquisitions, future private placements of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. Any such issuance would further dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock by our existing stockholders may continue to depress our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2014, 40,513,373 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, our outstanding Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 52,202,569 shares of our Common Stock, which represents approximately 56% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2014, as converted. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock to continue to decline.\nWe have not previously paid dividends on our Common Stock and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not in the recent past paid, and do not anticipate paying in the foreseeable future, cash dividends on our Common Stock. Additionally, any future decision to pay a dividend and the amount of any dividend paid, if permitted, will be made at the discretion of our board of directors.\nStockholders Who Hold Unregistered Shares of Our Common Stock Are Subject to Resale Restrictions Pursuant To Rule 144, Due To Our Status As A \u201cShell Company.\u201d\nPursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cRule 144\u201d), a \u201cshell company\u201d is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. As such, we are a shell company pursuant to Rule 144, and as such, sales of our securities issued at any time after we became a shell company pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until: (1) we have ceased to be a shell company; (2) we have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to Rule 144; and (3) a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date \u201cForm 10 information\u201d (i.e., information similar to that which would be found in a Form 10 Registration Statement filing with the SEC) has been filed with the SEC reflecting the Company\u2019s status as a non-shell company. Because none of such non-registered securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144, until at least a year after we cease to be a shell company, any non-registered securities we sell in the future or issue to management or service providers in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the SEC and/or until a year after we cease to be a shell company and have complied with the other requirements of Rule 144, as described above. As a result, it may be harder for us to pay management or other service providers with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of\ndebt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our status as a shell company could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging service providers, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions (although none are currently planned), which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.", "PERMNO": 91401, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "GMET"}
