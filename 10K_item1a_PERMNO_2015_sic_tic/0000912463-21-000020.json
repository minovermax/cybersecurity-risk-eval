{"cik": "912463", "company": "GUESS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks which we do not presently consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us. The information discussed below is at the time of this filing. Please also see \u201cImportant Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page (ii).\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nOur business is global in scope and can be impacted by factors beyond our control.\nAs a result of our large and growing international operations, we face the possibility of greater losses from risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from factors beyond our control. Such factors that could harm our results of operations and financial condition include, among other things: (i) political instability or acts of terrorism, which disrupt trade with the countries where we operate or in which our contractors, suppliers or customers are located; (ii) recessions and volatility in foreign economies; (iii) reduced global demand resulting in the closing of manufacturing facilities; (iv) challenges in managing dispersed foreign operations; (v) local business practices that do not conform to legal or ethical guidelines; (vi) adoption of additional or revised quotas, restrictions or regulations relating to imports or exports; (vii) additional or increased customs duties, tariffs, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; (viii) anti-American sentiment in foreign countries where we operate resulting from actual or proposed changes to U.S. immigration and travel policies or other factors; (ix) delays in receipts due to our distribution centers as a result of labor unrest, increasing security requirements or other factors at U.S. or other ports; (x) fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; (xi) increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions; (xii) social, labor, legal or economic instability in the foreign markets in which we do business, which could influence our ability to sell products in, or distribute products from, these international markets; (xiii) restrictions on the transfer of funds between the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions; (xiv) our ability and the ability of our international retail store licensees, distributors and joint venture partners to locate and continue to open desirable new retail locations; and (xv) natural disasters or public health crises in areas in which our contractors, suppliers, or customers are located.\nFurther, our international presence means we are subject to certain U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, including data privacy laws. If any of our international operations, or our employees or agents, violates such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nCurrency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and earnings.\nSince the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, Russian rouble and Turkish lira), currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings (loss) into U.S. dollars. These amounts could be materially affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, negatively impacting our results of operations, earnings and our ability to generate revenue growth. Furthermore, our products are typically sourced in U.S. dollars and the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the applicable local currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business, and the speed at which these fluctuations occur. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the respective fiscal 2021 foreign exchange rates, foreign exchange could negatively impact our revenues and operating results, as well as our international cash and other balance sheet items during fiscal 2022, particularly in Canada, Europe (primarily the euro, British pound, Turkish lira and Russian rouble) and Mexico.\nAlthough we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we cannot assure that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, since some of our hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility of fluctuating exchange rates, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. In addition, while our foreign currency hedges are designed to reduce volatility over the forward contract period, these contracts can create volatility during the period. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\nAbnormally harsh or unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our sales, inventory levels and operating results.\nExtreme weather conditions in areas in which our retail stores and wholesale doors are located, particularly in markets where we have a concentration of locations, could adversely affect our business. For example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nOur corporate headquarters, as well as other key operational locations, including retail, distribution and warehousing facilities, are in areas subject to natural events such as severe weather and geological events or public health crises that could disrupt our operations. Many of our suppliers and customers also have operations in these locations. The occurrence of such natural events may result in sudden disruptions in business conditions of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. Such disruptions could result in store closures, decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our management functions, sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial performance. The pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, including as a result of regional surges, the spread of virus variants and the timing and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments. To date, the Company has experienced temporary closures in key regions globally, along with other major retailers. In addition, retail stores have experienced significant reductions in traffic and therefore, revenue. The extent and duration of the crisis remains uncertain and may continue to have significant negative impacts to all aspects of our business and results of operations in future periods.\nFuture changes to U.S. tax or trade policies impacting multi-national companies could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we sourced most of our finished products with partners and suppliers outside the U.S. and we continued to design and purchase fabrics globally, with most coming from China. In addition, we have increased our sales of product outside of the U.S. In fiscal 2021, approximately 74% of our consolidated net product sales was generated by sales from outside of the U.S. In the long-term, we anticipate these international revenues will continue to grow as a percentage of our total business. The current political landscape has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations for U.S. companies with significant business and sourcing operations outside the U.S.\nThe ongoing economic conflict between the U.S. and China has resulted in increased tariffs being imposed on goods we import from China. We have been reducing our dependency on China sourcing, particularly for our U.S. business, and mitigating potential tariffs\u2019 risks without compromising the quality of our products, while improving costs. However, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements, such as those with China, or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions will be changed or imposed by the U.S. or by other countries. If we or our vendors or product licensees are unable to obtain raw materials or finished goods from the countries where we or they wish to purchase them, either because of such regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so should increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex tax matters, including those resulting from regulatory reviews, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to routine tax audits on various tax matters around the world in the ordinary course of business (including income tax, business tax, customs duties and Value Added Tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) matters). We regularly assess the adequacy of our uncertain tax positions and other reserves, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions and other reserves, the results of regulatory audits and negotiations with taxing and customs authorities may be in excess of our accruals, resulting in the\npayment of additional taxes, duties, penalties and interest. See \u201cPart IV. Financial Statements - Note 12 - Income Taxes\u201d in this Form 10-K for disclosures about our tax matters, including reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nFrom time-to-time, we make VAT and other tax-related refund claims with various foreign tax authorities that are audited by those authorities for compliance. Failure by these foreign governments to approve or ultimately pay these claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.\nChanges in tax laws, significant shifts in the relative source of our earnings, or other unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability and may result in volatility in our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. We record tax expense based on our estimate of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions and requires significant judgment in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be affected by a number of other factors, including: the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions, changes in our stock price, the resolution of uncertain tax positions and changes in our operating structure. We and our subsidiaries are engaged in intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe these transactions reflect arm\u2019s length terms and the proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, these transfer pricing terms and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates. In addition, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, as well as losses in jurisdictions where we are unable to realize the related tax benefits, can create volatility in our effective income tax rate. Any one of these factors could adversely impact our income tax rate and our profitability and could create ongoing variability in our quarterly or annual tax rates.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nIf we fail to successfully execute growth initiatives, including acquisitions and alliances, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall growth initiatives.\nThese efforts place increased demands on our managerial, operational and administrative resources that could prevent or delay the successful opening of new stores and the identification of suitable licensee partners, adversely impact the performance of our existing stores and adversely impact our overall results of operations. In addition, acquired businesses and additional store openings may not provide us with increased business opportunities, or result in the growth we anticipate, particularly during economic downturns. Furthermore, integrating acquired operations (including existing licensees or joint venture partners) is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Failing to acquire and successfully integrate complementary businesses, or to achieve the business synergies or other anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing our plans to open and operate new stores, which could harm our business and negatively affect our results of operations.\nNew store openings have historically been an important part of the growth of our business. To open and operate new stores successfully, we must: (i) identify desirable locations, the availability of which is out of our control; (ii) negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances; (iii) efficiently build and equip the new stores; (iv) source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of the new stores; (v) hire, train and retain competent store personnel; (vi) successfully integrate the new stores into our existing systems and operations; and (vii) satisfy the fashion preferences of customers in the new geographic areas.\nAny of these challenges could delay our store openings, prevent us from completing our store opening plans or hinder the operations of stores we open. These challenges could be even more pronounced in foreign markets\ndue to unfamiliar local regulations, business conditions and other factors. Once open, we cannot be sure that our new stores will be profitable. Unfavorable economic and business conditions and changing consumer preferences could also interfere with our store opening plans.\nFailure to successfully develop and manage new store design concepts could adversely affect our business.\nThe introduction and growth or maintenance of new store design concepts as part of our growth and productivity strategies could strain our financial and management resources and is subject to a number of other risks, including customer acceptance, product differentiation, competition and maintaining desirable locations. These risks may be compounded during difficult economic climates or future economic downturn. There can be no assurance that new store designs will achieve or maintain sales and profitability levels that justify the required investments. If we are unable to successfully develop new store designs, or if consumers are not receptive to the products, design layout, or visual merchandising, our results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of new store designs to achieve acceptable results could lead to unplanned store closures and/or impairment and other charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth.\nWe may not fully realize expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies related to cost-saving initiatives.\nWe have identified several areas that present opportunities for future cost savings and efficiencies, including improved working capital management, distribution, systems integration and development, supply chain, retail store rent relief efforts, store closure opportunities, and other initiatives, based on a number of assumptions and expectations which, if achieved, would improve profitability and cash flows from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance the expected results will be achieved. These and any future spend reductions, if any, may also negatively impact other initiatives or efforts to grow our business, which may negatively impact future results of operations and increase the burden on existing management, systems and resources. In addition, these cost savings may be negated or offset by unexpected or increased costs and poorer performance in other areas of the business.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by an outbreak of contagious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including new variants of the virus), the timing, distribution and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19, or other adverse public health developments resulting in business closures and limits domestic and international travel. These effects could include disruptions or restrictions on travel, temporary closures of our stores, office buildings or the facilities of our wholesale customers or suppliers. We may also see disruptions in shipments and negative impacts to pricing of certain product components. Further, any disruption of our customers or suppliers would likely impact sales and operating results. In addition, an outbreak of contagious disease could result in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn affecting demand for our end customers\u2019 products and impacting our operating results. The resulting economic downturn can also negatively impact our stock price.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been broad reaching, including impacts to our retail, wholesale and licensing businesses. The pandemic has impacted our business globally, with significant temporary store closures and materially lower traffic at open stores. The COVID-19 pandemic is also impacting the Asia region, which is the source of most of our goods. Temporary factory closures and the pace of workers returning to work could further impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to source raw materials and to timely produce and fulfill finished goods orders. We have also experienced modest impacts on deliveries, driven primarily by factory labor shortages and port congestion. The ability of our distribution and logistics providers to operate may be further impacted depending on the continued severity and duration of the pandemic and may have a significant impact on the cost and timing of receipts for future seasons. The occurrence of any of these events could further negatively impact our future consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There could be a prolonged impact on our business due to slow economic recovery or changes in consumer behavior. We currently anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements during the next 12 months primarily with cash flow from operations and existing cash balances as supplemented by borrowings under our existing Credit Facility in the U.S. and Canada as well as bank facilities in Europe and China as needed. However, if we have sustained decrease in consumer demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may require access to additional credit. There is no\nguarantee we will be able to obtain additional credit or extend or refinance our existing borrowing agreements. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as well as full fiscal 2022 could also be impacted in ways we cannot predict today, including, but not limited to, non-cash write-downs and asset impairment charges (including impairments on property and equipment, operating lease right-of use assets and goodwill); unrealized gains or losses related to investments; foreign currency fluctuations; and collections of accounts receivables.\nSlowing customer traffic in malls or outlet centers could significantly reduce our sales, increase pressure on our margins and leave us with excess inventory.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, changing shopping patterns, including significant increases in e-commerce sales, changing demographic patterns and other factors have adversely affected customer traffic in mall and outlet centers. This, in turn, has resulted in significant pricing pressures and a highly promotional retail environment in the apparel sector. Should these trends continue or worsen, it could negatively impact our sales, increase pressure on our margins, leave us with excess inventory, cause a decline in profits and negatively impact our liquidity.\nPoor or uncertain economic conditions, and the resulting negative impact on consumer confidence and spending, have had and could in the future have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy. Purchases of apparel and related merchandise are generally discretionary and therefore tend to decline during periods of economic uncertainty and recession, but may also decline at other times. Over the last several years, volatile economic conditions and uncertain market conditions in many markets around the world have resulted in cautious consumer spending. For example, a number of European countries experienced difficult economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues that negatively impacted the capital markets. These conditions resulted in reduced consumer confidence and spending in many countries in Europe, particularly Southern Europe. While these conditions have improved, if conditions in Europe, or other economic regions in which we do business, worsen or fail to further improve, there will likely be a negative impact on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere are a number of other factors that could contribute to reduced levels of consumer spending, such as increases in interest rates, currency fluctuations, inflation, unemployment, consumer debt levels, inclement weather, tax, net worth reductions based on market declines or uncertainty, energy prices and austerity measures. Similarly, natural disasters, labor unrest, actual or potential terrorist acts, public health crises, global trade, immigration policies, geopolitical unrest and other conflicts can also create significant instability and uncertainty in the world, causing consumers to defer purchases and travel, or prevent suppliers and service providers from providing required services or materials to us. These or other factors could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of quality raw materials and commodities could increase costs and negatively impact profitability.\nThe raw materials used to manufacture our merchandise are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, currency fluctuations, crop yields, weather patterns, climate change, supply conditions, government regulations (including tariffs), labor conditions, energy costs, transportation or freight costs, economic climate, public health crises, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. Negative trends in any of these conditions or our inability to appropriately project fabric requirements could increase costs and negatively impact profitability.\nRisks Related to Brand Reputation, Relevance and Protection\nDemand for our merchandise may decrease and the appeal of our brand image may diminish if we fail to identify and rapidly respond to consumers\u2019 fashion tastes.\nThe apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. Accordingly, our brand image and profitability are heavily dependent upon the priority our customers place on fashion and our ability to anticipate, identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react appropriately, or in a timely manner, to fashion trends (including as a result of our recent shift to a single global line of apparel), we could experience reduced consumer appeal and a diminished brand image. These factors could result in higher wholesale markdowns, lower average unit retail prices, lower product margins\nand decreased sales volumes and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we or our third-party providers fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure by us or our third-party providers to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. They could also impact investment decisions by investors, including some large institutional investors and funds, which could negatively impact our stock price. With the increased proliferation of social media, public perception about products, business practices, stores or brand, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and our methods of protecting it may not be adequate.\nOur success and competitive position depend significantly upon our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We take steps to establish and protect our trademarks worldwide. Any precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time consuming. We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or to determine the extent of any unauthorized use, particularly in those foreign countries where the laws do not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. We also place significant value on our trade dress and the overall appearance and image of our products. However, we cannot assure that we can prevent imitation of our products by others or prevent others from seeking to block sales of GUESS? products for purported violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights. We also cannot assure that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of GUESS?, our proprietary rights would be upheld if challenged or we would, in that event, not be prevented from using our trademarks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we could incur substantial costs in legal actions relating to our use of intellectual property or the use of our intellectual property by others.\nRisks Related to Third Party Relationships\nSince we do not control our licensees\u2019 actions and we depend on our licensees for a substantial portion of our earnings from operations, their conduct could harm our business.\nWe license to others the rights to produce and market certain products sold with our trademarks. While we retain significant control over our licensees\u2019 products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. If the quality, focus, image or distribution of our licensed products diminish, consumer acceptance of and demand for our brands and products could decline. This could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 72% of our net royalties were derived from our top five licensed product lines. A decrease in customer demand for any of these product lines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, purchases from our top two licensees in fiscal 2021 accounted for almost 27% of our total inventory purchases. Although we believe we could replace existing licensees if necessary, we may have a negative impact during the transition period. Our inability to replace existing licensees could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur success depends on the strength of our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers.\nThe majority of our finished goods are sourced from partners and suppliers located in over 30 countries outside the U.S. In fiscal 2021, over half of these products were sourced from partners and suppliers based in China. Our two largest suppliers, which were licensee partners, accounted for approximately 27% of our purchases of finished goods in fiscal 2021.\nWe do not own or operate production facilities, and depend on independent factories to supply fabric and manufacture products to our specifications. We do not have long-term contracts with any suppliers or manufacturers, and our business is dependent on our partnerships with our vendors. If manufacturing costs rise significantly, our product margins and results of operations could be negatively affected. In addition, very few of our vendors manufacture our products exclusively. As a result, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent contractors. If our vendors fail to ship our fabrics or products on time or to meet our quality standards or are unable to fill our orders, we might not be able to deliver products to our retail stores and wholesale customers on time or at all.\nMoreover, our suppliers have at times been unable to deliver finished products in a timely fashion. This has led, from time-to-time, to an increase in our inventory, creating potential markdowns and a resulting decrease in our profitability. As there are a finite number of skilled manufacturers that meet our requirements, it could take significant time to identify and qualify suitable alternatives, which could result in our missing retailing seasons or our wholesale customers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or requiring we lower selling prices. Since we prefer not to return merchandise to our manufacturers, we could also have a considerable amount of unsold merchandise. Any of these problems could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Cybersecurity\nA data privacy breach or failure to comply with data privacy laws could damage our reputation and customer relationships, expose us to litigation risk and potential fines and adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our normal operations, we collect, process, transmit and where appropriate, retain certain sensitive and confidential employee and customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information, consumer identity theft and user privacy. Despite the security measures in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. As a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers and other large institutions, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or employee information, whether by us or our vendors, could result in significant legal and remediation expenses, severely damage our reputation and our customer relationships, harm sales, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective May 2018, created new individual privacy rights and imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Consequently, we may incur significant costs related to prevention and to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information. A failure to comply with the stringent rules of the GDPR could result in material fines.\nOur business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.\nThe efficient operation of our business is very dependent on our computer and information systems. We rely heavily on our merchandise management and ERP systems used to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain. In addition, we have e-commerce and other Internet websites worldwide. Given the complexity of our business it is imperative that we maintain constant operation of our computer hardware and software systems. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage or interruption from, among other things, ineffective upgrades or support from third-party vendors, difficulties in replacing or integrating new systems, security breaches, computer viruses, natural disasters and power outages. Any such problems or interruptions could result in incorrect information being supplied to management, inefficient ordering and replenishment of products, loss of orders, significant expenditures, disruption of our operations, inability to produce accurate financial statements, and other adverse impacts to our business.\nRisks Related to Competition\nThe apparel industry is highly competitive, and we may face difficulties competing successfully in the future.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry with low barriers to entry. We compete with many apparel manufacturers and distributors, both domestically and internationally, as well as many well-known\ndesigners. We, along with our licensees, compete with many other designers and retailers (both brick and mortar and e-commerce sites), including department stores, some of whom are our major wholesale customers. Global and regional branded competitor companies pose significant challenges to our market share in our existing major domestic and foreign markets and to our ability to successfully develop new markets. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including greater financial and marketing resources, higher wage rates, lower prices, more desirable store locations, greater online and e-commerce presence and faster speed-to-market. In addition, our larger competitors may be better equipped to adapt to changing conditions affecting the competitive market and newer competitors may be viewed as more desirable by consumers. Also, in most countries, the industry\u2019s low barriers to entry allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. In other countries, high import duties may favor locally produced products. Any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or prices and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Americas Wholesale business is highly concentrated. If any large customers decrease their purchases or experience financial difficulties, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn fiscal 2021, our two largest wholesale customers accounted for a total of approximately 3.4% of our consolidated net revenue. No other single customer or group of related customers in any of our segments accounted for more than 1.0% of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2021. Continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our products and our licensees\u2019 products. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of designer brands seeking placement in department stores, which makes any one brand potentially less attractive to department stores. If any one of our major wholesale customers decides to decrease purchases from us, to stop carrying our products or to carry our products on less favorable terms, our sales and profitability could significantly decrease. Similarly, some retailers have recently experienced significant financial difficulties, which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcy, liquidation and store closures. Financial difficulties of one of our major customers could result in reduced business and higher credit risk with respect to that customer. Any of these circumstances could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal, Governmental and Regulatory Matters\nViolation of laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations at the state, federal including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and international levels, including, but not limited to, the areas of health care, data privacy, taxes, transportation and logistics, the environment, trade, conflict minerals, product safety, employment and labor, advertising and pricing practices, consumer protection, e-commerce, anti-competition, anti-corruption and intellectual property. Compliance with these numerous laws and regulations is complicated, time consuming and expensive. In addition, the laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to change from time to time, sometimes unexpectedly. Failure to comply or to effectively anticipate changes in such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nViolation of labor, environmental and other laws by our licensees or suppliers could harm our business.\nWe require our licensing partners and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines, code of conduct and monitoring programs promote ethical business practices and compliance with laws, we do not control our licensees or suppliers or their labor, environmental, safety or other business practices. A violation of law by any of our licensees or suppliers, or divergence of a licensee\u2019s or supplier\u2019s business practices or social responsibility standards from ours or those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., could disrupt the shipment of our products, harm the value of our trademarks, damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected obligations, as well as the diversion of time and resources.\nWe are involved from time-to-time in various U.S. and foreign lawsuits relating to our business, including purported class action lawsuits, employment claims and intellectual property claims. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such new or existing proceedings. Should management\u2019s evaluation of any such claims or proceedings or the likelihood of any future claims or proceedings prove incorrect, our exposure could materially exceed expectations,\nadversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation or regulatory matters, regardless of the merits, could divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. See \u201cPart IV. Financial Statements - Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in this Form 10-K for disclosures about our legal and other proceedings.\nRisks Related to Inventory, Human Capital and Supply Chain Management\nOur failure to retain our existing senior management team or to retain or attract other key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to ensure the timely delivery of desirable merchandise in appropriate quantities to our stores and other customers. This execution requires experienced and talented management in various areas of our business. Our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management, particularly Carlos Alberini, Chief Executive Officer, Paul Marciano, Chief Creative Officer, and other key personnel. Although we believe we have a strong management team with relevant industry expertise, the extended loss of the services of these or other key personnel and failure to effectively identify and attract suitable successors could materially harm our business.\nWe could find we are carrying excess inventories if we fail to shorten lead-times or anticipate consumer demand, if our international vendors do not supply quality products on a timely basis, if our merchandising strategies fail or if we do not open new and remodel existing stores on schedule.\nAlthough we have shortened lead-times for the design, production and development of a portion of our product lines, we expect to continue to place orders with our vendors for most of our products a season or more in advance. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to shorten lead-times or if we fail to anticipate fashion trends or consumer demand, we could have excess inventories. Additionally, our vendors could fail to timely supply the quality products and materials we require. Moreover, we could fail to effectively market or merchandise products once we receive them. We could fail to open new or remodeled stores on schedule, and inventory purchases made in anticipation of store openings could remain unsold. If we experience excess inventories including from temporary store closures, wholesale order cancellations and reduced consumer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, we could incur inventory write-downs and markdowns, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to deliver merchandise timely to our distribution facilities, stores or wholesale customers could disrupt our business.\nThe efficient operation of our global retail and wholesale businesses depends on the timely importation, customs clearance, and receipt of merchandise to and from distribution centers and our ability to efficiently process such merchandise. We receive merchandise at our distribution facilities and deliver merchandise to our stores and wholesale customers using independent third parties who import as well as transport goods. The independent third parties and entities on which they rely have employees which may be represented by labor unions. Disruptions in the delivery of merchandise caused by importation delays or work stoppages by employees or contractors of any of these third parties could delay the timely receipt of merchandise. Any failure by a third-party to respond adequately to our distribution needs could disrupt our business.\nA disruption at our distribution facilities could have a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.\nOur U.S. business relies primarily on a single distribution center located in Louisville, Kentucky to receive, store and distribute merchandise to our U.S. retail stores, wholesale customers and e-commerce customers. Distribution of our products in Canada is handled primarily from two distribution centers in Montreal, Quebec. In Asia, we utilize several third-party operated distribution warehouses that service the Asia region. In Europe, distribution of our products is handled primarily by third-party distributors through a distribution facility in Venlo, Netherlands. The Company continues to optimize its logistic network in Europe.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of any of our distribution centers due to natural events (including public health crises), weather conditions, accidents, system failures, capacity issues, labor issues, relationships with our third-party warehouse operators or landlords, failure to successfully complete or delays in optimizing our logistics network, new providers, and/or new distribution systems or other unforeseen causes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to efficiently manage the volume and/or costs associated with the\ndistribution of our products without encountering shipment delays or wholesale order cancellations. Such impacts could negatively impact our sales, inventory positions, operating results and customer relations.\nRisks Related to Credit, Indebtedness and Investment in our Stock\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase our $300 million 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nNoteholders may require us to repurchase their Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, including our current Credit Facility and other agreements we may enter into in the future, may restrict our ability to make payments on the Notes other than scheduled principal and interest, and as a result, upon a fundamental change we may not be able to repurchase the Notes and upon any conversions of the Notes may be unable to pay the cash amounts, if any, then due. Our inability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes could harm our reputation and affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur failure to repurchase Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion or at maturity when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the Notes.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance operations, fund acquisitions, or other purposes. In addition, we have reserved a substantial number of shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units pursuant to our employee benefit plans, upon conversion of the Notes and upon the exercise and settlement or termination of the warrant transactions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect they may have on the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.\nIf we issue additional shares of our common stock or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock and the Notes may significantly decrease. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nDifficulties in the credit markets could have a negative impact on our customers, suppliers and business partners, which, in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nThe impact of difficult credit conditions on our customers, business partners, suppliers, insurance providers and financial institutions with which we do business cannot be predicted and may be quite severe. The inability of our manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet delivery date requirements. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers, distributors or licensees to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses. A disruption in the ability of a large group of our smaller customers to access liquidity could have similar adverse effects, particularly in our important multi-brand wholesale channel in Southern Europe, where many customers tend to be relatively small and not well capitalized. These conditions could lead to significant reductions in future orders of our products and the inability or failure on our customers\u2019 part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.\nSimilarly, a failure on the part of our insurance providers to meet their obligations for claims made by us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Continued market difficulties or additional deterioration could jeopardize our ability to rely on those financial institutions that are parties to our various bank facilities and foreign exchange contracts. We could be exposed to a loss if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations upon our exercise of foreign exchange contracts. In addition, instability or other distress in the financial markets could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring its commitments. This could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\nAs of January 30, 2021, we had approximately $18.5 million of secured indebtedness, $366.7 million of senior unsecured indebtedness at maturity and approximately $300.4 million of trade payables on a consolidated basis.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness or draw on our existing credit facilities to meet future financing needs, some of which may be secured indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: (i) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; (ii) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; (iii) requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; (iv) limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; (v) diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and (vi) placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, our existing Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe conduct a significant amount of our operations through our subsidiaries and may rely on our subsidiaries to make payments under our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur ability to pay amounts due on our outstanding indebtedness may depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and any payments to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of our subsidiaries and various business considerations. Statutory, contractual or other restrictions may also limit our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to us, and the notes and the Indenture (as defined below) pursuant to which the notes were issued do not limit or restrict our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to enter into contractual restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to us. For these reasons, we may not have access to any assets or cash flows of our subsidiaries to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nRecent and future regulatory actions and other events may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Notes and the liquidity of the market for our common stock.\nNoteholders may seek to employ a convertible note arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Under this strategy, investors typically short sell a certain number of shares of our common stock and adjust their short position over time while they continue to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of, or in addition to, short selling shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC and other regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions, and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our common stock). These rules and actions include Rule 201 of SEC\nRegulation SHO, the adoption by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., and the national securities exchanges of a \u201climit up-limit down\u201d program, the imposition of market-wide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines, and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Any governmental or regulatory action that restricts investors\u2019 ability to effect short sales of our common stock or enter into equity swaps on our common stock could depress the trading price of, and the liquidity of the market for, the Notes.\nIn addition, the liquidity of the market for our common stock may decline, including as a result of our anticipated share repurchases, which could reduce the number of shares available for lending in connection with short sale transactions and the number of counterparties willing to enter into an equity swap on our common stock with a note investor. If investors and noteholders seeking to employ a convertible note arbitrage strategy are unable to borrow or enter into equity swaps on our common stock on commercially reasonable terms, then the trading price of, and the liquidity of the market for, the Notes may significantly decline.\nProvisions in the indenture for the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Indenture could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. If a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. As well, the Indenture prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. In such cases, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third-party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, noteholders will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more noteholders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle all or a portion of the conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if noteholders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nThe accounting method for reflecting the Notes on our balance sheet, accruing interest expense for the Notes and reflecting the underlying shares of our common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.\nUnder applicable accounting principles, the initial liability carrying amount of the Notes is the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have a conversion feature, valued using our cost of capital for straight, unconvertible debt. We reflect the difference between the net proceeds from the Notes offering and the initial carrying amount as a debt discount for accounting purposes, which will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the Notes. As a result of this amortization, the interest expense that we expect to recognize for the Notes for accounting purposes will be greater than the cash interest payments we will pay on the Notes, which will result in lower reported income or higher reported loss. The lower reported income or higher reported loss resulting from this accounting treatment could depress the trading price of our common stock and the Notes.\nIn addition, because we intend to settle conversions by paying the conversion value in cash up to the principal amount being converted and any excess in shares, we expect to be eligible to use the treasury stock method to reflect the shares underlying the Notes in our diluted earnings per share. Under this method, if the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share assuming that all the Notes were converted and that we issued shares of our common stock to settle the excess. However, if reflecting the Notes in diluted earnings per share in this manner is antidilutive, or if the conversion value of the Notes does not exceed their principal amount for a reporting period,\nthen the shares underlying the Notes will not be reflected in our diluted earnings per share. However, if for any reason we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share may be adversely affected. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently taken preliminary steps to potentially amend these accounting standards to eliminate the treasury stock method for convertible instruments and instead require application of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method. Under that method, if it is adopted, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be antidilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share.\nFurthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe Notes\u2019 hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions covered, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the Notes, including those sold to the initial purchaser, and are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary antidilution adjustments. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties or affiliates thereof entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes, and may unwind these derivative transactions and purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions shortly following the pricing of the Notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time.\nIn addition, the hedge counterparties or affiliates thereof may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Notes\u2019 hedge transactions.\nThe hedge counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that they might default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If any hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with such hedge counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties.\nConversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAt our election, we may settle Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Furthermore, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions are expected to be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the Notes or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes or such exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing\nmarket prices of our common stock and, in turn, the price of the Notes. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur repurchases of shares of our common stock may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nAfter effectuating the convertible note hedge transactions, we used substantially all of the net proceeds of the Notes offering to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our $500 million share repurchase program. Some of these transactions were affected by repurchases from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions through the initial purchaser or its affiliate, as our agent, concurrently with the closing of the Notes offering, and we may continue to effect repurchases in open market or other transactions from time to time in the future. These activities and our other repurchases of shares of our common stock may cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes and add volatility. There can be no assurance that repurchases will be made at the best possible price. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, but are not necessarily limited to, the amount and timing of future share repurchases and the origin of funds used for such repurchases. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time. Any such suspension could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFluctuations in quarterly performance including comparable store sales, sales per square foot, operating margins, timing of wholesale orders, royalty net revenue or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our stock price.\nOur quarterly results of operations for each of our business segments have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future. Further, if global growth plans or productivity initiatives fail to meet our expected results, our overhead and other costs could increase without an offsetting increase in sales and net revenue. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including but not limited to future impairments of store assets or goodwill.\nOur net revenue and operating results have historically been lower in the first half of our fiscal year due to general seasonal trends in the apparel and retail industries. Our comparable store sales, quarterly results of operations and stock price can also be affected by a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to: (i) shifts in consumer tastes and fashion trends; (ii) the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores; (iii) the timing and effectiveness of planned store closures; (iv) calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods; (v) the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments; (vi) the effectiveness of our inventory management; (vii) the effectiveness and efficiency of our product distribution network; (viii) changes in our merchandise mix; (ix) changes in our mix of revenues by segment; (x) the timing of promotional events; (xi) actions by competitors; (xii) weather conditions; (xiii) public health crises; (xiv) changes in the business environment; (xv) inflationary changes in prices and costs; (xvi) changes in the payment of future cash dividends; (xvii) changes in currency exchange rates; (xviii) population trends; (xix) changes in patterns of commerce such as the expansion of e-commerce; (xx) the level of pre-operating expenses associated with new stores; and (xxi) volatility in securities\u2019 markets which could impact the value of our investments in non-operating assets.\nAn unfavorable change in any of the above factors, among others could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.\nWe cannot ensure that we will continue paying dividends at the current rates, or at all.\nWe cannot ensure we will continue periodic dividends on our common stock at the current rates, or at all. Our Board of Directors determined to reduce the quarterly cash dividend paid to holders of our common stock, when, as and if any such dividend with respect to any future period is decided by the Board of Directors, from $0.225 per share to $0.1125 per share. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Board of Directors deferred the decision with respect to the payment of the quarterly cash dividend, and decided to continue to postpone its decision with respect to such dividend during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in order to preserve the Company\u2019s cash position and provide continued financial flexibility in light of uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company announced that it would resume paying its quarterly cash dividend of $0.1125 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, but decided not to declare any cash dividends for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021.\nChanges in our dividend and market perceptions and expectations with respect to our dividend, may materially affect the price of our common stock and the Notes (as defined below). See \u201cPart IV. Financial Statements - Note 10 - Convertible Senior Notes and Related Transactions\u201d in this Form 10-K for disclosures about the Notes.\nAny quarterly dividends on our common stock will be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Holders of our equity securities have no contractual or other legal right to receive dividends. Decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to continue making any future dividend distributions are entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or terminate our dividend practices at any time and for any reason without prior notice, including without limitation for any of the following reasons: (i) our cash requirements or plans might change for a wide variety of reasons, including changes in our financial position, capital allocation plans (including a desire to retain or accumulate cash), capital spending plans, stock purchase plans, acquisition strategies, strategic initiatives, debt payment plans (including a desire to maintain or improve credit ratings on our debt securities), pension funding or other benefits payments; (ii) our ability to service and refinance our current and future indebtedness and our ability to borrow or raise additional capital to satisfy our capital needs; (iii) the amount of dividends that we may distribute to our shareholders is subject to restrictions under applicable law and restrictions imposed by our existing or future credit facilities, debt securities, then-outstanding preferred stock securities, if any, leases and other agreements, including restricted payment and leverage covenants; and (iv) the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may make available to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments, may be subject to the legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions in our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur Two Founding Board Members own a significant percentage of our common stock. Their interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nMaurice Marciano, Board member, and Paul Marciano, Chief Creative Officer and Board member, collectively beneficially own approximately 38% of our outstanding shares of common stock. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. Moreover, these individuals may have different interests than our other stockholders and, accordingly, they may direct the operations of our business in a manner contrary to the interests of our other stockholders. As long as these individuals own a significant percentage of our common stock, they may effectively be able to: (i) elect our directors; (ii) amend or prevent amendment of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (iii) effect or prevent a merger, sale and/or purchase of assets or other corporate transactions; and (iv) control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote.\nTheir stock ownership, together with the anti-takeover effects of certain provisions of applicable Delaware law and our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, may discourage acquisition bids or allow the Marciano\u2019s to delay or prevent a change in control that may be favored by our other stockholders, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our common stock price.", "PERMNO": 83822, "SIC": 2330, "TIC": "GES"}
