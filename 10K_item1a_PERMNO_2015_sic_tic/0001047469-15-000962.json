{"cik": "350907", "company": "THORATEC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur businesses face many risks. The risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks facing our company; however, they may not be the only risks we face. Our business operations could also be impaired by other risks of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Investors should consider the following risks, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, such as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any public announcements we make from time to time.\nIf we fail to obtain clearance or approval from the FDA and from foreign regulatory authorities for our products, we will not be able to market and sell such products in the U.S. and such other countries where clearance or approval has not been obtained, and if we fail to comply with government regulations, including the FDA Quality System Regulation, or if our products experience certain adverse events, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may withdraw our marketing clearance or approval or take other enforcement action.\nBefore we can market new products in the U.S., we must obtain premarket approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA unless an exemption applies. These processes are lengthy, expensive and uncertain. If the FDA concludes that any of our products does not meet the requirements to obtain clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, then we will be required to obtain a PMA for that product. A PMA application typically requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data.\nWe may not obtain clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a PMA application with respect to any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our products, we will not be able to market and sell them, thereby harming our ability to generate sales. The FDA also may limit the claims that we can make about our products. We also may be required to obtain clearance of a 510(k) notification, a new PMA, or a PMA Supplement from the FDA before we can market products that have already been cleared, but that have since been modified or that we subsequently wish to market for new indications. In the U.S., our currently commercialized products have either received premarket clearance or approval of a PMA.\nIn addition, our medical device products and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA pursuant to the FDCA and by various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Government regulations and foreign requirements specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things, design, development, manufacture, testing, labeling, storage, marketing, distribution, promotion, record keeping, and approval or clearance. The FDA requires us and certain of our third-party suppliers to adhere to Quality System Regulations (\"QSR\"), which include production design controls, testing, quality control, and labeling, packaging, sterilization, and storage and documentation procedures. The FDA may at any time inspect our facilities to determine whether we have adequate compliance with the FDA's QSR and other regulatory requirements. Compliance with the QSR for medical devices is difficult and costly. If our facilities or those of our suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection, the FDA could take enforcement action. For example, the FDA has issued and could in the future issue warning letters or other communications to us. If we fail to satisfy or remediate the matters discussed in any such warning letters or communications, the FDA could take further enforcement action, including prohibiting the sale or marketing of the affected product. The FDA also strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other activities relating to the marketing of our products. Medical devices may be promoted only for their cleared or approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the cleared or approved label. It is possible that federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under a variety of statutory authorities, including under the FDCA as well as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. For example, as part of FDASIA, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \"Medical Device Regulatory Improvements\" and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. Moreover, the FDA and Congress continue to propose initiatives that are designed to, among other things, improve the efficiency and transparency of the regulatory review and clearance process and bolster patient safety. It is unclear what, if any, of these proposals will be finalized or enacted. We may be found noncompliant as a result of future changes in, or interpretations of, regulations by the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nSales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from FDA requirements. In any event, if we fail to obtain the necessary clearance or approvals to sell any of our products in a foreign country, or if any obtained clearance or approval is revoked or suspended, we will not be able to sell those products there.\nThe federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to future changes, as are administrative interpretations and policies of regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions. Enforcement actions could include product seizures, recalls, withdrawal of clearances or approvals, and civil and criminal penalties, which in each case would harm our business.\nIf hospitals do not continue to conduct Destination Therapy procedures using our VADs, the market opportunities for our products will be diminished.\nThe use of certain of our VADs as long-term therapy in patients who are not candidates for heart transplantation (i.e., Destination Therapy patients) was approved by the FDA in 2002, and was approved for coverage and reimbursement by the CMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, in late 2003. We received FDA approval for the HeartMate II in Destination Therapy on January 20, 2010.\nThe number of Destination Therapy procedures actually performed depends on many factors, many of which are out of our direct control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the number of CMS sites approved for Destination Therapy;\n\u2022 the clinical outcomes of Destination Therapy procedures relative to pharmacological, gene- and cell-based therapies, and other device based alternatives;\n\u2022 cardiologists' and referring physicians' education regarding, and their commitment to, Destination Therapy;\n\u2022 the economics of the Destination Therapy procedure for individual hospitals, which include the costs of the VAD and related pre- and post- operative procedures and their reimbursement;\n\u2022 the impact of changes in reimbursement rates on the timing of purchases of VADs for Destination Therapy; and\n\u2022 the economics for individual hospitals of not conducting a Destination Therapy procedure, including the costs and related reimbursements of long- term hospitalization.\nThe different outcomes of these and other factors, and their timing, will have a significant impact on our future product sales.\nPhysicians may not accept or continue to accept our current products and products under development.\nThe success of our current and future products will require acceptance or continued acceptance by cardiovascular and vascular surgeons, cardiologists and other medical professionals. Such acceptance will depend on clinical results, as well as the results of any post-approval clinical trials that we may conduct, and the conclusion by these professionals that our products are and continue to be safe, cost-effective and acceptable methods of treatment. Even if the safety and efficacy of our future products are established, physicians may elect not to use them for a number of reasons. These reasons could include the high cost of our VAD systems, restrictions on insurance coverage, unfavorable reimbursement from healthcare payors, or use of alternative therapies including pharmacological, gene- and cell-based therapies, and other device based alternatives. Also, economic, psychological, ethical and other concerns may limit general acceptance of our ventricular assist products.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, our product sales or operating results may be harmed.\nCompetition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of healthcare companies, pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and is expected to increase. The vast majority of VAD- eligible patients still receive pharmacological treatment instead of a VAD. We continue to expect new competitors both from the pharmacological and the medical device space. Among the medical device competitors are Aachen Innovative Solutions GmbH, AbioMed, Inc., Berlin Heart GmbH, HeartWare International Inc., Jarvik Heart, Inc., Maquet Cardiovascular, LLC (a division of Getinge AB), ReliantHeart, Inc., Sun Medical Technology Research Corporation, SynCardia Systems, Inc., and Terumo Heart, Inc.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, distribution, marketing and manufacturing resources than we do, while other competitors have different technologies that may achieve broader customer acceptance or better cost structures than our products. Accordingly, our competitors may be able to develop, manufacture and market products more efficiently, at a lower cost and with more market acceptance than we can. In addition, new drugs or other devices may provide additional alternatives to VADs. We expect that the key competitive factors will include the relative speed with which we can:\n\u2022 develop products;\n\u2022 complete clinical testing;\n\u2022 receive regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022 achieve favorable clinical results; and\n\u2022 manufacture and sell commercial quantities of products.\nAny of the devices of our competitors currently available, in clinical trials or in development could prove to be, or be perceived by our customers as being, clinically superior, easier to implant, and/or less expensive than current commercialized devices, thereby impacting our market share.\nWe rely on specialized and single source suppliers for certain components and materials in our products and alternative suppliers may not be available.\nWe depend on a number of custom designed components and materials supplied by other companies including, in some cases, single source suppliers for components, instruments and materials used in our VAD products. For example, a single source supplier currently manufactures and supplies components used to manufacture the ruby bearings used in the HeartMate II pump. We do not have long-term written agreements with most of our suppliers and receive components from these suppliers on a purchase order basis only. If we need alternative sources for key raw materials or component parts for any reason, such alternative sources may not be available and our inventory may not be sufficient to fill orders before we find alternative suppliers or begin manufacturing these components or materials ourselves. Cessation or interruption of sales of circulatory support products may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlternative suppliers, if available, may not agree to supply us. In addition, FDA approval may be required before using new suppliers or manufacturing our own components or materials, which can take additional time to procure. Existing suppliers could also become subject to an FDA enforcement action, which could also disrupt our supplies. If alternative suppliers are not available, we may not have the expertise or resources necessary to produce these materials or component parts internally.\nBecause of the long product development cycle in our business, or because we do not always purchase goods in significant quantities, suppliers may discontinue components upon which we rely before the end of life of our products. In addition, the timing of the discontinuation may not allow us time to develop and obtain FDA approval for a replacement component before we exhaust our inventory of the legacy component.\nIf suppliers discontinue components on which we rely, we may have to:\n\u2022 pay premium prices to keep our existing suppliers' production lines open or to obtain alternative suppliers;\n\u2022 buy substantial inventory to last through the scheduled end of life of our products, or through such time that we expect to have a replacement product developed and approved by the FDA; or\n\u2022 stop shipping the product in which the legacy component is used once our inventory of the discontinued component is exhausted.\nAny of these interruptions in the supply of our materials could result in substantial reductions in product sales and increases in our production costs.\nWe may encounter problems manufacturing our products.\nWe may encounter difficulties manufacturing products in quantities sufficient to meet demand. If, for instance, the FDA approves or clears a new product or a new indication for an existing product, we may not be able to manufacture such product in the quantities needed to meet the increased commercial demand for such product on a timely basis. In addition, any alterations or modifications to an existing product may result in increased manufacturing lead times for such products. Moreover, we and some of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with the FDA's QSR and the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process for products marketed abroad. Our facilities are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies to audit compliance with the QSR and comparable foreign regulations. If our facilities or those of our manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or if we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection, the regulatory authority could take enforcement action. If we have difficulty manufacturing any of our products, or we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, our ability to produce products in a cost-effective and timely manner will be impaired, our sales may prove lower than would otherwise be the case, and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIdentified quality problems can result in substantial costs and write-downs.\nFDA regulations require us to track materials used in the manufacture of our products, so that any problems identified in a finished product can easily be traced back to other finished products containing the defective materials. In some instances, identified quality issues require scrapping or expensive rework of the affected lot(s), not just the tested defective product, and could also require us to stop shipments.\nIn addition, because some of our products are used in situations where a malfunction can be life threatening, identified material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or labeling can result in the recall and replacement, generally free of charge, of substantial amounts of products already implanted or otherwise in the marketplace. Manufacturers may, on their own initiative, initiate actions, including a non-reportable market withdrawal or a reportable product recall, for the purpose of correcting a material deficiency or improving device performance, or for other reasons. Additionally, the FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may initiate certain voluntary recalls, which can include field safety notices or physical product removal, involving our products in the future. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. If we determine that certain of those recalls do not require notification of the FDA, the FDA may disagree with our determinations and require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, negatively affect our sales, and subject us to additional FDA enforcement actions.\nMoreover, depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product's deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. If we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines.\nAny identified quality issue can therefore both harm our business reputation and result in substantial costs and write-offs, which in either case could materially harm our business and financial results.\nIf we fail to successfully introduce new products, our future growth may suffer.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop and introduce a number of new products and product improvements. We also intend to develop new indications for our existing products. If we fail to obtain clearance or approval from the FDA or other foreign governmental authorities and fail to successfully commercialize any of these new products or product improvements or to develop new indications on a timely basis, or if such products, product improvements or indications are not well accepted by the market, our future growth may suffer.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the pre-clinical studies or clinical trials necessary to support our PMA applications or PMA supplements, our ability to obtain new approvals will be limited.\nBefore submitting a PMA application, we must successfully complete pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective. Product development, including pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays, and failure may occur at any stage. Furthermore, the data obtained from the trial may be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022 patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect;\n\u2022 patients do not comply with trial protocols;\n\u2022 patient follow-up is not at the rate we expect;\n\u2022 patients experience adverse side effects;\n\u2022 patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to our products;\n\u2022 institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators delay or reject our trial protocol;\n\u2022 third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely and accurate manner;\n\u2022 regulators inspect our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;\n\u2022 there are changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;\n\u2022 the interim or final results of a clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and\n\u2022 the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results, and predecessor clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to prove safety or efficacy, and may require us to pursue additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could further delay the approval of our products. If we are unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products in our clinical trials, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market our products. The data we collect from our current clinical trials, our pre-clinical studies and other clinical trials may not be sufficient to support FDA approval. Moreover, if the results of any post-market clinical studies are not favorable, our existing clearances or approvals may be impacted.\nOur inability to protect our proprietary technologies or an infringement of others' patents could harm our competitive position.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. In addition, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will issue. Governmental intellectual property authorities, in the U.S. and abroad, may deny or significantly narrow claims made under patent applications and the issued patents, if any, may not provide us with commercial protection. We could incur substantial costs in any future litigation to enforce our patents in court. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the validity and/or enforceability of our patents. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries.\nMany aspects of VAD products are not protected by any patents and, in such instances, we generally rely on trade secret protection and contractual provisions to protect our rights to our products and technology.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology, in part, with confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants. Although it is our policy to require that all employees and consultants sign such agreements, we cannot assure you that every person who gains or has gained access to such information has done or will do so. Moreover, these agreements may be breached and we may not have an adequate remedy when we learn of such breach, if at all.\nIntellectual property litigation is inherently complex and the results uncertain. Our products may be found to infringe prior or future patents owned by others. We may need to pay significant monetary damages and/or acquire patent licenses with royalty payments. Additionally, adverse outcomes in intellectual property trial proceedings could limit our ability to sell current or future products. We could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us on such patents or in bringing suits to protect our patents or patents licensed by us against infringement.\nBecause we depend upon distributors in certain foreign markets, if we lose a distributor or a distributor fails to perform, our operations may be harmed.\nWith the exception of Canada, Australia, and certain countries in Europe, we sell our Thoratec, HeartMate, and CentriMag product lines in foreign markets through distributors.\nTo the extent we rely on distributors, our success will depend upon the efforts of others, over whom we may have little or no control. Further, contractual, regulatory and legal considerations may make it difficult to terminate an underperforming distributor and to appoint suitable replacements when distributors are terminated or lost, which could harm our product sales, results of operations and reputation in the affected territories.\nOur non-U.S. sales present additional risks, which could harm our operations or financial results.\nA substantial portion of our total sales occurs outside the U.S. We anticipate that sales outside the U.S. and U.S. export sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our product sales and we intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets. Non-U.S. sales are subject to a number of additional risks. For example:\n\u2022 we sell some of our products at lower prices outside the U.S.;\n\u2022 sales agreements with foreign customers and distributors may be difficult to enforce;\n\u2022 receivables may be difficult to collect through a foreign country's legal system;\n\u2022 fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability, in U.S. dollars, of products sold in foreign markets where payments are made in other currencies;\n\u2022 foreign customers and distributors may have longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade;\n\u2022 U.S. export licenses may be difficult to obtain;\n\u2022 intellectual property rights may be (and often are) more difficult to enforce in foreign countries;\n\u2022 terrorist activity or war may interrupt distribution channels or adversely impact our customers or employees; and\n\u2022 fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions, specifically among emerging markets, could materially impact demand for our products in individual countries.\nAny of these events could harm our operations or financial results.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings.\nBecause some of our international sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. At present, we use forward foreign currency contracts to protect the gains and losses created by the re-measurement of non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. However, we do not hedge foreign currency exposures that will arise from future sales. As a result, sales occurring in the future that are denominated in foreign currencies may be translated into U.S. dollars at a less favorable rate than our current exchange rate resulting in reduced revenues and earnings.\nThe long and variable sales and deployment cycles for our VAD systems may cause our product sales and operating results to vary significantly, which increases the risk of an operating loss for any given fiscal period.\nOur VAD systems have lengthy sales cycles and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant effort without making a sale. Even after making the decision to purchase our VAD systems, our customers often deploy our products slowly. For example, the length of time between initial contact with potential customers and the purchase of our VAD systems is generally between nine and eighteen months. In addition, cardiac centers that buy the majority of our products are usually led by cardiac surgeons who are heavily recruited by competing centers or by centers looking to increase their profiles. When one of these surgeons moves to a new center we sometimes experience a temporary but significant reduction in purchases by the departed center while it replaces its lead surgeon. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which customers may purchase our VAD systems and our product sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which increases the risk of an operating loss for us for any given quarter.\nBecause our physician and hospital customers depend on third-party reimbursement, if third party payors, including government agencies such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products, our results of operations will be harmed. Similarly, if third party payors decide to restrict coverage or the ability of hospital customers to treat patients using VAD therapy, our results of operations could also be harmed.\nGovernmental and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs. Payors are attempting to contain costs by, for example, limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement of new therapeutic products. Payors are also attempting to contain costs, in some cases by refusing to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications other than those for which the FDA has granted marketing approval.\nTo date, a majority of private insurers with whom we have been involved, as well as CMS, which is responsible for implementing the Medicare program, have determined to reimburse some or all of the cost associated with the implantation of our VADs, but we cannot predict whether our products or the services performed with the use of our products will continue to be approved for reimbursement in whole or in part. In addition, changes in the healthcare system may affect the reimbursability of future products. If coverage were partially or completely reduced, our revenues and results of operations would be harmed. This uncertainty could delay or prevent adoption by hospitals of our products.\nHealthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We continuously monitor these developments and modify our operations from time to time as the legislative and regulatory environment changes. We are unable to predict whether any current congressional proposals will become law or in what form, whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations (including interpretations) will occur in the future, or what effect any such legislation or regulation, if implemented, would have on our business. The federal government is expected to have increasing involvement in the healthcare industry, and such increasing involvement may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the various state and federal legislative changes see \"Business-Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement.\"\nComplying with federal, state and international laws and regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are directly or indirectly through our customers subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including the regulation under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state anti-kickback laws, the federal False Claims Act, HIPAA, HITECH and similar state laws addressing information privacy and security, federal and state healthcare professional payment transparency laws, state corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting prohibitions, state certificate of need laws, the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), among other federal and state regulations. Both federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies, as well as their executives and managers. These investigations relate to a wide variety of matters, including referral and billing practices. The OIG and the Department of Justice have, from time-to-time, established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. Some of our activities could become the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of \"Conflict Minerals\" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, and their derivatives. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and shareholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are also subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that increase the cost of doing business in each of the foreign countries where our products are sold. These laws and regulations include the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar worldwide and local anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, transparency laws and laws addressing information privacy and security. Although, we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations as well as training on such policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, distributors and agents will not violate our policies.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines or curtailment of our operations, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management's attention from the operation of our business. For a more detailed discussion of the various state, federal, and international regulations to which we are subject see \"Business-Government Regulations\" and \"Business-Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement.\" See also the risks described under the heading \"If we fail to comply with federal and state anti-kickback laws, our operations and income may be adversely affected\" in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nWe depend on HeartMate II for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our HeartMate II product. While we cannot predict what level of revenues our HeartMate II product will generate, we anticipate that HeartMate II pump sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Implementation of our strategy depends on continued sales of our HeartMate II product. Sales of our HeartMate II product are subject to the factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 failure to obtain clearance or approval from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities or to comply with government regulations, or the withdrawal of market clearance or approval or the taking of other enforcement actions;\n\u2022 lack of Destination Therapy procedures conducted by hospitals using our VADs;\n\u2022 lack of acceptance or continued acceptance by physicians;\n\u2022 reliance on specialized suppliers for certain components and materials;\n\u2022 manufacturing problems;\n\u2022 any identified quality problems;\n\u2022 inability to protect our proprietary technologies or an infringement of others' patents;\n\u2022 loss of a distributor or distributor failure to perform;\n\u2022 failure to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors;\n\u2022 special risks associated with non-U.S. sales;\n\u2022 long and variable sales and deployment cycles;\n\u2022 failure by third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement;\n\u2022 failure to comply with federal and state regulations; and\n\u2022 product liability claims.\nThe outcomes of these and other factors will have a significant impact on our future HeartMate II product sales and our revenues.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. President signed the PPACA, which makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of this legislation on our business as its various provisions are implemented. It may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and therefore our financial position and results of operations, possibly materially.\nSpecifically, one of the components of the new law is an excise tax on sales of most medical devices, which include our MCS products that began in 2013. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax applies to most of our product revenue generated within the U.S. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the total cost to the medical device industry could exceed $30 billion over ten years. This tax may put increased pressure on medical device manufacturers and purchasers, decrease profits to us, and/or reduce medical procedure volumes, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other elements of the PPACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms (including shared savings pilots) and the reporting of certain payments by us to healthcare professionals and hospitals (the \"Physician Payment Sunshine Act\"), could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state and federal levels, and we are unable to predict which, if any of these proposals will be enacted. We believe that the uncertainty created by healthcare reform in the U.S. has complicated our customers' decision-making process and may impact our MCS business, and we expect that this uncertainty will persist until there is greater clarity on how the PPACA and state and federal proposals will affect healthcare providers. We are unable to predict what effect the ongoing uncertainty surrounding these matters will have on our customers' purchasing decisions. However, an expansion in government's role in the U.S. healthcare industry may adversely affect our business, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state anti-kickback laws, our operations and income may be adversely affected.\nVarious federal and state laws govern financial arrangements among healthcare providers. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare program patients, or in return for, or to induce, the purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Many state laws also prohibit the solicitation, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of patients in private as well as government programs. Violation of these laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs. While we believe that we have structured our operations and our arrangements with providers to comply with the federal and state anti-kickback laws, it is possible that these laws could be interpreted in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, under the DRA, states are encouraged to adopt false claims acts, similar to the federal False Claims Act, which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the State Medicaid program and contain qui tam or whistleblower provisions. States enacting such false claims statutes will receive an increased percentage of any recovery from a State Medicaid judgment or settlement.\nAdoption of new false claims statutes in states where we operate may impose additional requirements or burdens on us, which could adversely affect our operations and income.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the various state and federal anti- kickback regulations to which we are subject see \"Business-Government Regulations\".\nOur liabilities expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we experience a decline in product sales due to any of the factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying current and total liabilities. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our current and total liabilities, we would be in default.\nIt may be difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions or general corporate purposes, and therefore limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business by reducing funds available for use in our operations. This could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or an increase in interest rates and place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.\nAny failure to meet our obligations under our current and long-term liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nValuation adjustments to goodwill and intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of our total assets, may adversely affect our net income and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nA substantial portion of our assets is comprised of goodwill and intangible assets, recorded as a result of our merger with Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc. in 2001, the acquisition of Levitronix Medical in 2011, the acquisition of DuraHeart II in 2013, and the acquisition of Apica Cardiovascular Limited in 2014. We may not receive the recorded value for our intangible assets if we sell or liquidate our business or assets. The material concentration of intangible assets or goodwill increases the risk of a large charge to earnings if recoverability of these intangible assets or goodwill is impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our net income. For example, in fiscal 2012 we recorded an impairment charge of $50.2 million related to the intangibles assets from our merger with Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc.\nProduct liability claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results.\nOur business exposes us to an inherent risk of potential product liability claims related to the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of medical devices. We maintain a limited amount of product liability insurance. Our insurance policies generally must be renewed on an annual basis. We may not be able to maintain or increase such insurance on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs, and such insurance may not provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. A successful claim brought against us in excess, or outside, of our insurance coverage could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also reduce our ability to obtain physician acceptance of our products or expand our business.\nThe competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry. If we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial and financial personnel, and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas. We face intense competition for such personnel, and we may not be able to attract and retain these individuals. We compete for talent with numerous companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations, throughout all our locations. The loss of key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business. Our success will depend in large part on the continued services of our research, managerial and manufacturing personnel. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, which means that it could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, our closing stock price ranged from $22.74 to $38.66 during the twelve months ended January 3, 2015. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 future announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory developments, including ongoing healthcare reform initiatives, enforcement actions bearing on advertising, marketing or sales, and disclosure regarding completed ongoing or future clinical trials;\n\u2022 enforcement actions or civil or criminal investigations or suits by the FDA, SEC, DOJ, OCR, OIG or state or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 reports of adverse events or poor clinical results, including in the form of scientific papers;\n\u2022 initiation or resolution of product liability claims involving one or more of our devices;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in operating results, which we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future;\n\u2022 introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 acquisition or loss of significant customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022 reaction to our estimates of business operations, product development or financial performance;\n\u2022 business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022 changes in our capital structure, liquidity profile or ability to access capital markets for additional financing;\n\u2022 changes in earnings estimates by analysts;\n\u2022 changes in third party reimbursement practices;\n\u2022 announced common stock repurchases;\n\u2022 charges, amortization and other financial effects relating to our business;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the economy, world political events or general market conditions; and\n\u2022 the realization or occurrence of a situation or event described in this Risk Factors section.\nIn addition, stock markets in general and the market for shares of healthcare stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently as a result of the global financial crisis. These fluctuations can be unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our stock may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance.\nShareholders often have instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities. Securities class action suits have been filed against us in the past, including most recently in January 2014, resulting in substantial legal fees and our management's attention and resources being diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation.\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions could adversely affect our business and liquidity.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global economic, political and market conditions. Uncertainty about global economic, political and market conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses decrease or postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. Renewed concerns about the systemic impact of the recent recession, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, or the global housing and mortgage markets could contribute to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for mature and emerging economies. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, potentially leading to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike.\nGlobal economic, political and material conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and the demand for our products and services. In addition, turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our distributors, customers and suppliers, including ours and their ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.\nIf we make acquisitions or divestitures, we could encounter difficulties that harm our business.\nWe may acquire other companies or their products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our business, such as the purchase of Levitronix Medical in August 2011, DuraHeart II in June 2013, and Apica Cardiovascular Limited in 2014. We may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel and operations, or developing the products or technologies, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any such acquisition. As with any product or technology still under development, the products or technologies we acquire may never be commercialized. In addition, acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses, any of which could harm our business. We may also sell businesses or assets, such as the 2010 sale of our wholly owned subsidiary, International Technidyne Corporation, and we may sell an asset or business for less than its carrying value.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and changes in our business, and our failure to manage this and any future growth could harm our business.\nThe number of our employees has substantially increased during the past several years. We expect to continue to increase the number of our employees, and our business may suffer if we do not manage and train our new employees effectively. Our product sales may not continue to grow at a rate sufficient to support the costs associated with an increasing number of employees. Any future periods of rapid growth may place significant strains on our managerial, financial and other resources. The rate of any future expansion, in combination with our complex technologies and products, may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating, planning, coordinating and meeting our operational needs, as well as the needs of our customers. If we are unable to meet these demands our reputation, revenue and results of operations could be harmed.\nRevisions to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements could result in changes to our standard practices and could require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources, especially by senior management.\nWe must follow accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws set by the governing bodies and lawmakers in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions where we do business, as well as NASDAQ. From time to time, these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws. These new and revised accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements may require changes to our financial statements, the composition of our Board of Directors, the responsibility and manner of operation of various board level committees and the information filed by us with the governing bodies. Our accounting practices that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting principles are as follows:\n\u2022 accounting for revenue recognition;\n\u2022 accounting for intangibles-goodwill and other;\n\u2022 fair value measurement;\n\u2022 accounting for convertible debt instruments;\n\u2022 accounting for income taxes;\n\u2022 accounting for leases; and\n\u2022 accounting for business combinations.\nImplementing changes required by new standards, requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources. It is impossible to completely predict the impact, if any, on us of future changes to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nWe use estimates, make judgments and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies. As these estimates, judgments and methods change, our assessment of the progress of our business and our results of operations could vary.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may cause variation in our reporting and may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nThe occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, or those of our suppliers, which would require us to cease or curtail operations.\nWe are vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters, including earthquakes, fires, terrorist acts, floods, power losses, communications failures and similar events. If any such disaster were to occur, we might not be able to operate our business at our facilities, and because our premises require FDA approval, we could experience significant delays before we could manufacture products from a replacement facility. Our Pleasanton facility is located in an area of frequent seismic activity. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in locations vulnerable to various types of disasters. Any insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions and our emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future. Therefore, any such catastrophe could seriously harm our business and consolidated results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions and changes to the corporate tax rate and laws of any of these jurisdictions could increase the amount of corporate taxes we have to pay.\nWe pay taxes principally in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland, Germany and France and these tax jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws, which could increase our future tax obligations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, by unanticipated decreases in the percentage of revenue or earnings in states with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, state tax authorities, and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax expense and our reserves for potential adjustments, including tax credits and other tax benefits that can be challenged under audit by various taxing authorities resulting in potential reduction in the amount of credits or other benefits eventually realized. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nFuture levels of research and development spending, capital investment, and export sales may impact our entitlement to related tax credits and benefits, which have the effect of lowering our tax rate.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the additional taxes to which we are subject see \"Business-Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement.\"\nAny claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals and biomaterials could be time consuming and costly to address.\nManufacturing and research and development of our products require the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biomaterials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials.\nWe could be subject to both criminal liability and civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts or harm our operating results.\nAnti-takeover defenses in our governing documents could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur governing documents could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company. For example, our Articles of Incorporation allow our Board of Directors to issue, at any time and without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as it may determine. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. However, the rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. This could limit the price that certain potential acquirers would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay, prevent or allow our Board of Directors to resist an acquisition of our company, even if the proposed transaction was favored by a majority of our independent shareholders.\nDisruptions of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations and financial condition.\nWe rely in part on information technology to store information, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and accurately produce our financial statements. If our information technology systems do not effectively and securely collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store customer, employee and business partner and, in certain instances patient, personally identifiable information. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, including our own proprietary information and the confidential and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, business partners and patients, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach or cyber-attack affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged and our operations could be impaired. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 76100, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "THOR.1"}
