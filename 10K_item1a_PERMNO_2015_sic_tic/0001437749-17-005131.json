{"cik": "1389545", "company": "NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, the most important of which are discussed below. You should consider carefully the following risks in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC before deciding to buy, sell or hold our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nWe have a history of losses and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred net losses and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability. In addition, at this time:\n\u2022\nwe expect to incur substantial marketing and sales expenses as we continue to attempt to increase sales of our Avenova product\n\u2022\nour results of operations may fluctuate significantly\u037e\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates\u037e and\n\u2022\nit may be difficult to forecast accurately our key operating and performance metrics because of our limited operating history.\nWe will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. If we cannot successfully market and sell Avenova, either independently or with partners, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve and subsequently maintain profitability could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nIf we conduct offerings in the future, the price at which we offer our securities may trigger a price protection provision included in warrants originally issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, reducing the probability and magnitude of any future share price appreciation.\nAs part of our October 2015 offering, we agreed to provide certain price protections affecting currently outstanding warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 565,695 shares of our common stock, of which 281,093 shares must be issued, if at all, by March 6, 2020, and 284,602 shares must be issued, if at all, by October 27, 2020 (the \u201cWarrants\u201d). Specifically, in the event that we undertake a third-party equity financing of either: (1) common stock at a sale price of less than $5.00 per share\u037e or (2) convertible securities with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, we have agreed to reduce the exercise price of all Warrants to such lower price. The exercise price of the Warrants is currently set at $1.81 as a result of our February 2016 private placement offering. The further reduction of the exercise price for the Warrants would limit the probability and magnitude of future share price appreciation, if any, by placing downward pressure on our stock price if it exceeds such offering sale price. All of the Warrants are currently exercisable and will remain so after any exercise price adjustment. In the past, we have extended the expiration dates or adjusted other terms of the Warrants as consideration for certain offering conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. Any such modifications would reduce the probability and magnitude of any share price appreciation during the period of the extension. We cannot guarantee that you will receive a return on your investment when you do sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment. If you do receive a return on your investment, it may be lower than the return you would have realized in the absence of the price protection provisions discussed hereof.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, which may result in losses to our stockholders.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry have generally experienced wide fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of new products by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of partnering arrangements by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations\u037e\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us related to litigation\u037e\n\u25cf\nchanges in our earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 earnings estimates\u037e\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our industry\u037e and\n\u25cf\ngeneral, economic and market conditions, including volatility in the financial markets, a decrease in consumer confidence and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThe volume of trading of our common stock may be low, leaving our common stock open to the risk of high volatility.\nThe number of shares of our common stock being actively traded may be very low and any stockholder wishing to sell his, her, or its stock may cause a significant fluctuation in the price of our stock. We have a number of large stockholders, including our principal stockholders China Pioneer Pharma Holdings Limited (\u201cChina Pioneer\u201d), Pioneer Pharma (Hong Kong) Company Limited as a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Pioneer and the recipient of all of the holdings of Pioneer Pharma (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. pursuant to an internal corporate reorganization of China Pioneer (\u201cPioneer Hong Kong\u201d) and Mr. Jian Ping Fu. Each of China Pioneer and Mr. Fu own 34% and 26% of our common stock, respectively. The sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by such large stockholders within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease substantially. In addition, low trading volume of a stock increases the possibility that, despite rules against such activity, the price of the stock may be manipulated by persons acting in their own self-interest. We may not have adequate market makers and market making activity to prevent manipulation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer that is beneficial to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, engage in proxy contests and effect changes in control. The provisions of our charter documents include:\n\u25cf\na classified board so that only one of the three classes of directors on our Board of Directors is elected each year;\n\u25cf\nelimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors\u037e\n\u25cf\nprocedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval\u037e and\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which includes provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our Company. Provisions of the DGCL could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock by discouraging a hostile bid, or delaying, preventing or deterring a merger, acquisition or tender offer in which our stockholders could receive a premium for their shares, or effect a proxy contest for control of NovaBay or other changes in our management.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, you will experience a return on your investment in our shares only if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure you that you will receive a return on your investment when you do sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nChina Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong, Mr. Jian Ping Fu and/or China Kington might influence our corporate matters in a manner that is not in the best interest of our general stockholders.\nAs of March 1, 2017, China Pioneer beneficially owns approximately 34% of our common stock. Our director Mr. Xinzhou \u201cPaul\u201d Li is the chairman of China Pioneer. Pursuant to the arrangement of our Bridge Loan, two (2) of our directors were nominated by China Kington, including Mr. Mijia \u201cBob\u201d Wu, who is the Managing Director of China Kington and Non-Executive Director of Pioneer Hong Kong, and Mr. Xiaoyan \u201cHenry\u201d Liu, who has worked closely with China Kington on other financial transactions in the past. Mr. Jian Ping Fu beneficially owns approximately 26% of our common stock. China Kington and its affiliates have served as placement agent for three purchases of Company securities by Mr. Fu during the last year.\nAs a result, China Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong as a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Pioneer and China Kington have input on all matters before our Board of Directors and may be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring board and stockholder approval. Please see the risk factor entitled \u201cWe may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future, which may in turn limit our ability to develop and commercialize products and technologies.\u201d China Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong and China Kington may choose to exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of our general stockholders.\nIn addition, were China Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong and Mr. Fu to cooperate, they could unilaterally elect all of their preferred director nominees at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Even with our classified board, China Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong and Mr. Fu could ensure that five (5) of our eight (8) directors are either nominees of China Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong or China Kington. In the interim, China Pioneer, Pioneer Hong Kong, China Kington and/or Mr. Fu could exert significant indirect influence on us and our management.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which, combined with the purchasing shareholders\u2019 subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in one or more changes of control, as defined by Section 382 of the Code. We have not currently completed a study to assess whether any change of control has occurred, or whether there have been multiple changes of control since our formation, due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such study. If we have experienced a change of control at any time since its formation, its NOL carryforwards and tax credits may not be available, or their utilization could be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. In addition, since we may need to raise additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Avenova.\nThe future success of our business is largely dependent upon the successful commercialization of Avenova. We are dedicating a substantial amount of our resources to advance Avenova as aggressively as possible. If we encounter difficulties in its commercialization, we may not have the resources necessary to continue our business in its current form. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products. We believe we are creating an efficient commercial organization. However, we may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution necessary to be successful. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of Avenova.\nOur commercialized products are not approved by the FDA as a drug, so we rely solely on the 510(k) clearance of Neutrox as a medical device.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, use and sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of our products, except as allowed by the FDA. As a medical device, our claims regarding efficacy are limited. Without claims of efficacy, market acceptance of our products may be slow.\nThere is a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities may constitute the promotion of our products for a non-FDA-approved use in violation of applicable law. We also face the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations concerning the promotion of off-label uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities. In addition, were any enforcement actions against us or our senior officers to arise, we could be excluded from participation in U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capacity, and we rely on partnering arrangements or third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our products and potential products.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for production of our product and product candidates. We have no experience in product formulation or manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we have partnered and expect to partner with third parties to manufacture our products or rely on contract manufacturers to supply, store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our commercial partners or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and reducing or delaying product revenues.\nOur products and product candidates do and will require precise, high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers and partners often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. These manufacturers and partners are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with Quality Systems Regulations, current Good Manufacturing Practice and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. If any of our manufacturers or partners fails to maintain compliance, the production of our products could be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs and potentially lost revenues.\nIn addition, if the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities. Significant scale-up of manufacturing will require validation studies, which the FDA must review and approve. If we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of any products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe depend on skilled and experienced personnel and management leadership to operate our business effectively and maintain our investor relationships. If we are unable to retain, recruit and hire such key employees, our ability to manage our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees. The efforts of our officers and other key employees are critical to us as we continue to focus on the commercialization of our Avenova product with the goal of achieving positive cash flow from operations by the end of 2016. The loss of any of our senior management team members could disrupt our business, affect key partnerships and impair our future revenue and profitability. In particular, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark M. Sieczkarek, is critical to our successful commercialization of Avenova, and we have entered into an executive employment agreement with him, expiring on May 31, 2017.\nWe intend to rely on a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers to distribute Avenova.\nWe intend to rely primarily upon a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers in connection with the distribution of Avenova. If we are unable to establish or maintain our business relationships with these pharmaceutical wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and may prevent us from achieving profitability.\nIf we grow and fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nOur future growth, if any, may cause a significant strain on our management and our operational, financial and other resources. Our ability to grow and manage our growth effectively will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to expand, train, manage and motivate our employees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by management. Any increase in resources devoted to research and product development without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial and management information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to our products or proposed products or change legislation or regulations to which we are subject.\nGovernment usage guidelines typically address matters such as usage and dose, among other factors. Application of these guidelines could limit the use of our products and products that we may develop. In addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our products or proposed products or the interpretation thereof will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of our products for a period of time or permanently. The FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could modify, prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other countries.\nWe and our collaborators are and will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we and our collaborators may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations or new regulations, all of which may result in significant expense and which may limit our ability to commercialize our medical devices and drug products and candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies. The FDA may require us to commit to perform lengthy post marketing studies, which would require us to expend additional resources and thus could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, if the FDA approves any of our drug product candidates, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping for the drug will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drugs, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drugs or the withdrawal of the drugs from the market. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Any of these events could prevent us from marketing any products we may develop and our business could suffer.\nOur past clinical trials may expose us to expensive liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all.\nEven though we have concluded all our clinical trials, an inherent risk remains. If a claim were to arise in the future based on our past clinical trial activity, we would most likely incur substantial expenses. Our inability to obtain sufficient clinical trial insurance at an acceptable cost to protect us against potential clinical trial claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates. Our current clinical trial insurance covers individual and aggregate claims up to $5.0 million. This insurance may not cover all claims and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all, in the future. In addition, if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses and clinical trial liability, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nThe pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by patent litigation, and any litigation or claim against us may impose substantial costs on us, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. Generic companies are encouraged to challenge the patents of pharmaceutical products in the United States because a successful challenger can obtain six months of exclusivity as a generic product under the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect that we will rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we may initiate claims to defend our intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know-how or require us to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce our products. In addition, future patents may be issued to third parties which our technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, would divert management\u2019s attention from our business and could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, we might be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we were found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent, to the party claiming infringement, to develop non-infringing technology, to stop selling any products we develop, to cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or to enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. Modification of any products we develop or development of new products thereafter could require us to conduct additional clinical trials and to revise our filings with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which would be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling any products we develop, which could harm our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, they could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nDespite all reasonable efforts to ensure safety, it is possible that we or our collaborators will sell products, including Avenova, NeutroPhase, CelleRx, and intelli-Case, which are defective, to which patients react in an unexpected manner, or which are alleged to have side effects. The manufacture and sale of such products may expose us to potential liability, and the industries in which our products are likely to be sold have been subject to significant product liability litigation. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nIf a product liability claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim and, if the claim is successful, damage awards may not be covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance. We may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets. We may also be obligated to indemnify our collaborators and make payments to other parties with respect to product liability damages and claims. Defending any product liability claims, or indemnifying others against those claims, could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products similar to ours that may reduce demand for our products.\nOur success, competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in significant part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We apply for patents covering our technologies as we deem appropriate.\nThere is no assurance that any patents issued to us or licensed or assigned to us by third parties will not be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. If we or our collaborators or licensors fail to file, prosecute or maintain certain patents, our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of any products we develop, and demand for our products could decline as a result. Further, although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, third parties may be able to design around our patents or, if they do infringe upon our technology, we may not be successful or have sufficient resources in pursuing a claim of infringement against those third parties. Any pursuit of an infringement claim by us may involve substantial expense and diversion of management attention.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. If these agreements are not enforceable, or are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nWe operate in the State of California. The laws of the State prevent us from imposing a delay before an employee who may have access to trade secrets and proprietary know-how can commence employment with a competing company. Although we may be able to pursue legal action against competitive companies improperly using our proprietary information, we may not be aware of any use of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how until after significant damage has been done to our company.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If our intellectual property does not provide significant protection against foreign or domestic competition, our competitors, including generic manufacturers, could compete more directly with us, which could result in a decrease in our market share. All of these factors may harm our competitive position.\nOur current patent portfolio could leave us vulnerable to larger companies who have the resources to develop and market competing products.\nWe aggressively protect and enforce our patent rights worldwide. However, certain risks remain. There is no assurance that patents will issue from any of our applications or, for those patents we have or that do issue, that the claims will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights, or that it will be economically possible to pursue sufficient numbers of patents to afford significant protection. For example, we do not have any composition of matter patent directed to the Neutrox composition. This relatively weak patent portfolio leaves us vulnerable to competitors who wish to compete in the same marketplace with similar products. If a potential competitor introduces a formulation similar to Avenova or NeutroPhase with a similar composition that does not fall within the scope of the method of treatment/manufacture claims, then we or a potential marketing partner would be unable to rely on the allowed claims to protect its market position for the method of using the Avenova or NeutroPhase composition, and any revenues arising from such protection would be adversely impacted.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nEven if the FDA has cleared or approves product candidates that we develop, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our products may depend on a number of factors including:\n\u25cf\nperceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products\u037e\n\u25cf\npublished studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products\u037e\n\u25cf\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or healthcare payers\u037e and\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nThe failure of any of our products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.", "PERMNO": 92345, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NBY"}
