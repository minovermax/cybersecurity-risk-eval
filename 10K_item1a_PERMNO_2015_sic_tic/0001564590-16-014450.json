{"cik": "1449278", "company": "TUBEMOGUL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If any of the following risks is realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2007 and had an accumulated deficit of $37.0 million as of December 31, 2015. We may not be profitable in the future as we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our platform and in sales and marketing to acquire new customers. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. Even if we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may not become profitable in the future or may be unable to maintain any profitability achieved if we fail to increase our revenue and manage our operating expenses or if we incur unanticipated liabilities. Although our revenue has increased substantially in recent periods, the rate of growth has declined in recent quarters. We may not be able to slow or reverse this decline in the revenue growth rate and we may not be able to sustain current revenue levels. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our offering, increasing competition, lengthening sales cycles, decelerating growth of, or declines in, our overall market, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities or to introduce new offerings. We could also incur increased losses as we continue to focus on growing our Platform Direct offering because the sales cycle with those customers tends to be protracted, resulting in the majority of costs associated with sales of our Platform Direct offering being generally incurred up front, while customers are billed over time through our usage-based pricing model. Any failure by us to achieve and maintain profitability could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nAlthough we began our operations in March 2007, we did not launch our platform or begin generating substantial revenue until the second half of 2011. While we have experienced significant growth in recent periods, our short operating history and developing business model make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market acceptance of our platform and future features and functionality, competition from new and established companies, including those with greater financial and technical resources, acquiring and retaining customers and increasing revenue from existing customers, enhancing our platform and developing new technologies, features and functionality. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties that we will encounter as we continue to develop our business model. We may not be able to address these risks and difficulties successfully, which would materially harm our business and operating results and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may not maintain our recent revenue growth.\nOur revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire new customers, gain a larger amount of our existing customers\u2019 advertising spend, continue to innovate and develop new technologies, features and functionality, extend our global footprint and increase our share of and compete successfully in new, growing digital video advertising markets, and we may fail to do so. A variety of factors outside of our control could affect our revenue growth, including changes in spend budgets of advertisers and the timing and size of their spend. Decisions by advertisers to delay or reduce their advertising spending or divert spending away from video advertising could slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenue. Our success in implementing our strategy of migrating customers from our Platform Services offering to our Platform Direct offering could also slow our revenue growth as we recognize a higher amount of revenue from the same amount of spend associated with our Platform Services offering than with our Platform Direct offering. You should not consider our recent growth rate in revenue as indicative of our future growth.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not consider our past results, including our recent growth rates in terms of advertising spend and revenue, as indicative of our future performance.\nIn addition to other risk factors listed in this section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in demand for our platform, including seasonal variations in our customers\u2019 advertising spend;\n\u00b7\nthe level of advertising spend managed through our platform for a particular quarter and the mix between spend managed through our Platform Direct offering and Platform Services offering;\n\u00b7\nbudgeting cycles and changes in video advertising budgets of and spending by our customers;\n\u00b7\nthe length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycle;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of investment in the development of new technologies, and features and functionality of our platform;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the availability or price of advertising inventory;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and success of changes in our offerings or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing or pricing of our competitors\u2019 solutions and changes in the pricing of digital video advertising generally;\n\u00b7\nnetwork outages or security breaches or the perception that our platform or customer or consumer data is not secure and any associated expenses;\n\u00b7\ndelay between our payments for advertising inventory purchased through our platform and our subsequent collection of fees from our customers related to that inventory;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government regulation applicable to our industry;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nBased upon all of the factors described above, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and expenses, and as a result, our operating results may from time to time fall below our estimates.\nIf our customers do not maintain and increase their advertising spend through our platform, our revenue growth and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur contracts and relationships with advertisers generally do not include long-term or exclusive obligations requiring them to use our platform or maintain or increase their advertising spend on our platform. Furthermore, advertisers generally use multiple providers in managing advertising spend. Accordingly, we must convince our customers to use our platform, increase their usage and spend a larger share of their advertising budgets with us, and do so on an on-going basis. We may not be successful at educating and training customers, particularly our newer customers, on the benefits of our platform to increase usage and generate higher levels of advertising spend. If these efforts are unsuccessful or advertisers decide not to continue to maintain or increase their advertising spend through our platform for any other reason, then we may not attract new advertisers or our existing customers may reduce their video advertising spend through or cease using our platform. Therefore, we cannot assure you that advertisers that have generated advertising spend through our platform in the past will continue to generate similar levels of advertising spend in the future or that they will continue to use our platform at all. We may not be able to replace customers who decrease or cease their usage of our platform with new customers that spend similarly on our platform. If our existing customers do not continue to use and increase their use of our platform, or if we are unable to attract sufficient advertising spend on our platform from new customers, our revenue could decline, which would materially and adversely harm our business and results of operations.\nThe market for software-based digital video advertising for brands is relatively new and evolving. If this market develops slower or differently than we expect, our business, growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe substantial majority of our revenue has been derived from customers that purchase digital video advertising through our platform either on a self-serve basis or with us executing campaigns for them. We expect that spend on digital video advertising will continue to be our primary source of revenue for the foreseeable future, and that our revenue growth will largely depend on increasing digital video advertising spend through our platform. The market for digital video advertising is an emerging market and today advertisers generally devote a smaller portion of their advertising budgets to digital video advertising than to traditional advertising methods, such as TV, newspapers, radio and billboards. Our current and potential customers may find digital video advertising to be less effective than other brand advertising methods, and they may reduce their spending on digital video advertising as a result. To\ndate, digital advertising has been primarily for performance-based advertising, or relatively simple display advertising such as banner ads on websites and, until recently, was principally focused on online channels such as desktops. Emerging channels such as mobile and social media are unproven and may not develop into viable channels. The future growth of our business could be constrained by both the level of acceptance and expansion of digital video advertising as a format and emerging digital video advertising channels, including mobile video, connected TV, social video and TV formats such as video on demand, as well as the continued use and growth of existing channels. To date, our revenue has been derived primarily from advertising served to desktops. Even if these new channels become widely adopted, advertisers may not increase their advertising spend through platforms such as ours. If the market for digital video advertising deteriorates, develops more slowly than we expect or the shift from traditional advertising methods to digital video advertising does not continue, or there is a reduction in demand for digital video advertising caused by weakening economic conditions, decreases in corporate spending, perception that digital video advertising is less effective than other media or otherwise, it could reduce demand for our offerings, which could decrease revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe have recently added the capability to buy linear television advertising using our platform. The market for software-based solutions for linear television advertising is new and unproven. Our current and potential customers may find software-based solutions for linear television advertising purchasing to be less effective than traditional methods, and they may determine not to utilize such solutions. The future growth of our business could be constrained by both the level of acceptance and expansion of the market for software-based solutions for linear television advertising. If the market for software-based solutions for linear television advertising develops more slowly than we expect, it could reduce demand for our offerings, which could decrease revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market, subject to changing technology, branding objectives and customer demands and with many companies providing competing solutions. We compete primarily with companies developing solutions to automate the purchase of digital video advertising impressions across multiple sources of inventory. We also compete with other companies that address certain aspects of the online digital video advertising market, including demand-side platforms and video-focused ad networks, and in-house tools and custom solutions currently used by brand advertisers and their agencies and by publishers to manage advertising activities. In addition, we compete for advertising spend with large entities that offer digital video advertising services as part of a larger solution for digital media buying. In the future, we may compete with companies developing comprehensive marketing platforms. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, exchange or other third-party specific technologies may also compete with us. As our platform evolves and we introduce new technologies, features and functionality of our platform, we may become subject to additional competition. Some of our current and prospective competitors in the broader digital advertising market have substantially greater resources and longer histories than us in the digital advertising space, may actively seek to serve our market and have the power to significantly change the nature of the marketplace to their advantage. These companies could develop and offer new solutions that directly compete with ours or leverage their position to make changes to their existing platforms that could be disadvantageous to our competitive position. We expect competition to increase with the changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including increasing consolidation among our competitors, customers and partners.\nIncreased competition may result in reduced pricing for our platform, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business. A number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell at lower prices or at reduced margins, including, among others:\n\u00b7\ncompetitors may establish or strengthen relationships with brands, agencies, sources of inventory or other parties, thereby limiting our ability to promote our platform and generate revenue;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors could introduce solutions that are similar to, or broader, than ours or comprehensive platforms that provide integrated solutions for multiple advertising channels including display, mobile and video;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors could reduce the prices they charge to brand advertisers and agencies;\n\u00b7\ncompanies may enter our market by expanding their platforms or acquiring a competitor; and\n\u00b7\ncompanies marketing search, social, display, mobile or web analytics services could bundle digital video advertising solutions or offer such products at a lower price as part of a larger product sale.\nIn addition, many of our competitors, such as Google, AOL (recently acquired by Verizon), Yahoo! and Adobe, have greater customer relationships and financial, marketing and technical resources than we do, allowing them to leverage a larger customer base, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products, services and solutions, including products that may be based on new technologies or standards, than we can. Some of these large competitors also have substantial proprietary video advertising inventory that may provide them with competitive advantages, including far greater access to Internet data, the ability to significantly influence pricing for video advertising inventory and the ability to control access to proprietary inventory. If our competitors\u2019 solutions become more accepted than our solution, our competitive position will be impaired and we may not be able to increase our revenue or may experience decreased gross margins.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we cannot compete successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are successful at increasing adoption of our self-serve platform, we may become dependent on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenue, which could impact the predictability of our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.\nTo the extent our self-serve platform is adopted by major brands and other large advertisers, we may become more dependent upon a limited number of customers for a larger portion of our revenue. Since large advertisers tend to spend a much greater amount on advertising campaigns than our typical customers have in the past, it would be difficult to maintain our revenue growth rate without increases in spending from these customers. It also would be difficult to replace any revenue generated by these customers to the extent they lower their spend through our platform. Accordingly, if our revenue concentration increases and our largest customers do not generate revenue at the levels or within the timeframes that we expect, our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and meet our quarterly guidance will be adversely affected. Additionally, larger customers often seek to gain greater pricing concessions which can adversely impact our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our business is sourced through advertising agencies that do not pay us until they receive payment from the brand, therefore increasing the length of time between our payment for media inventory and our receipt of payment for use of our platform, and our ability to collect for non-payment may be limited to the brand, increasing our risk of non-payment.\nSubstantially all of our Platform Services revenue and a substantial majority of our Platform Direct revenue is sourced through advertising agencies. We contract with advertising agencies as an agent for the brand. We remit payment for media inventory purchased through our platform by our Platform Direct and Platform Services customers in advance of receiving payment from them as the advertising agency does not pay us for use of our platform until it has received payment from the brand. This payment process will increasingly consume working capital if we continue to be successful in growing our business. In addition, we typically experience slow payment by advertising agencies as is common in our industry. In this regard, we had average days sales outstanding, or DSO, of 103 days, and average days payable outstanding, or DPO, of 86 days for 2015. We compute our DSO and DPO as of a given date based on our average trade receivables or trade payables, respectively, for the trailing twelve month period divided by, for DSO, daily Total Spend and for DPO, daily cost of revenue and operating expenses, excluding noncash and payroll related expenses, in each case, over such period. The average trade receivables or trade payables are the average of the trade receivables or trade payables balances at the beginning and end of the twelve month period. Daily Total Spend is the spend for the trailing twelve month period divided by 365 days. Daily cost of revenue and operating expenses are the cost of revenue and operating expenses, excluding noncash and payroll related expenses, for the trailing twelve month period divided by 365 days. If our DSOs increase significantly, and we are unable to borrow against these receivables on commercially acceptable terms, our working capital availability could be reduced, and as a consequence our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted. Many of our contracts with advertising agencies provide that if the brand does not pay the agency, the agency is not liable to us, and we must seek payment solely from the brand. Contracting with these agencies, which in certain cases have or may develop high-risk credit profiles, subjects us to greater credit risk than where we contract with brands directly. This credit risk may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency\u2019s aggregated brand advertiser base. Any write-offs for bad debt could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. Even if we are not paid, we are still obligated to pay for the advertising we have purchased for the advertising campaign, and as a consequence, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted.\nOur business depends in part on advertising agencies and their holding companies as intermediaries, and this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, over 5,000 brands executed campaigns through our platform, directly or through an agency. Many brands rely upon advertising agencies in planning and purchasing advertising. Although we maintain relationships with brands, we often do not contract with them directly. In cases where we do not have a direct contractual relationship with the brand, we sell to advertising agencies that utilize our advertising solutions on behalf of their customers. Each advertising agency allocates advertising spend from brands across numerous channels and has no obligation to work with us as it embarks on advertising campaigns. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with an advertising agency, we risk losing business from the brands represented by that agency. If the advertising agency is owned by a holding company, this risk is magnified because we also risk losing business from the other agencies owned by such holding company and the brand advertisers those agencies represent. In addition, customer relationships with holding company media trading desks may adversely affect our business with advertising agencies affiliated with the holding company because some holding companies may seek to consolidate media buying to one trading desk and restrict their affiliated advertising agencies from relationships with providers that have a direct relationship with the trading desk. Because advertising agencies act as intermediaries for multiple brands, our customer base is more concentrated than might be reflected by the number of brands that use our platform. In addition, these intermediary relationships may impede our brand-building efforts, making it more difficult for us to achieve widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense before executing a customer agreement, which may make it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate revenue from those customers.\nThe sales cycle for our Platform Direct business, from initial contact with a potential lead to contract execution and implementation, typically takes significant time and is difficult to predict. Our sales cycle in some cases has been up to nine months or more. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our platform. Some of our customers undertake a significant evaluation process that frequently involves not only our platform but also the offerings of our competitors. This process can be costly and time-consuming. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and begin generating revenue from these new customers. As part of our sales cycle, we may incur significant expenses before executing a definitive agreement with a prospective customer and before we are able to generate any revenue from such agreement. We have no assurance that the substantial time and money spent on our sales efforts will generate significant revenue. If conditions in the marketplace generally or with a specific prospective customer change negatively, it is possible that no definitive agreement will be executed, and we will be unable to recover any of these expenses. Even if our sales efforts result in obtaining a new customer, under our usage-based pricing model, the customer controls when and to what extent it uses our platform and it may not use our platform sufficiently to justify the expenses incurred to acquire the customer and integrate the customer\u2019s data in our platform and related training and support. If we are not successful in targeting, supporting and streamlining our sales processes and if revenue expected to be generated from a prospective customer is not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, our ability to grow our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. If our sales cycles lengthen, our future revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and infrastructure. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nWe increased our number of full-time employees from 57 as of December 31, 2011 to 577 as of December 31, 2015. Our growth has placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources as these personnel are integrated into and become productive within our organization. We intend to further expand our overall headcount and operations both domestically and internationally, with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow to offset our investment in research and development and sales and marketing. Maintaining and growing a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort, the allocation of valuable management resources and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. In this regard we will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. Further, to accommodate our expected growth we must continually improve and maintain our technology, systems and network infrastructure. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which would negatively impact our gross margin or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that does not preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our platform may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract key talent and customers.\nSeasonal fluctuations in advertising spend impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations and cash flows vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertising spending. For example, many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. In contrast, the first quarter of the calendar year is typically the slowest in terms of advertising spend. To the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, or are not offset by other factors, our results of operations and operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period.\nWe use a limited number of third-party service providers and data centers. Any disruption of service could harm our business.\nThe technical infrastructure for our platform is managed through a combination of third-party web hosting services providers, or third-party service providers, and our own servers which are located at a third-party data center facility. We do not control the operation of the third-party service providers or the operation of the third-party data center facility nor do we have long term agreements with the third-party service provider and data center facility that we utilize. The third-party service providers and owner of the data center facility have no obligation to continue to provide these services to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to use a new service provider or transfer to a new facility or facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nThe facilities of third-party service providers and data centers are vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. Moreover, we have not implemented a disaster recovery capability whereby we maintain a back-up copy of our platform permitting us to immediately switch over to the back-up platform in the event of damage or service interruption at our data center. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, any outages or vandalism or other misconduct, or a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our platform\u2019s performance, any of which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our operating results and future prospects.\nAny changes in service levels at the facilities or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to the facilities that affect our platform could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our platform\u2019s performance might reduce our revenue, subject us to potential liability, or result in reduced usage of our platform. In addition, some of our customer contracts require us to issue credits for downtime in excess of certain levels and the issuance of any credits or make-goods could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe also depend on third-party Internet-hosting providers and continuous and uninterrupted access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our Internet-hosting or bandwidth providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, for example due to viruses or \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d or other attacks on their systems, or due to human error, intentional bad acts, power loss, hardware failures, telecommunications failures, fires, wars, terrorist attacks, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or similar events, we could experience disruption in our ability to offer our platform or we could be required to retain the services of replacement providers, any of which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and reputation.\nAs a result of our customers\u2019 increased usage of our platform, we will need to continually improve our hosting infrastructure.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of customers, transactions and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers. We also seek to maintain excess capacity to facilitate the increase in new customers and the expansion of existing customer advertising spend on our platform. For example, if we secure a large customer or a group of customers which require significant amounts of bandwidth or storage, we may need to increase bandwidth, storage, power or other elements of our application architecture and our infrastructure, and our existing systems may not be able to scale in a manner satisfactory to our existing or prospective customers.\nThe amount of infrastructure needed to support our customers is based on our estimates of anticipated usage. We will need to expand our infrastructure to meet anticipated increase in usage, for which we expect to incur additional costs. In addition, if we were to experience unforeseen increases in usage, we could be required to increase our infrastructure investments further and during a time other than we expect. As use of our platform grows, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture and our infrastructure in order to maintain the performance of our platform. We may need to incur additional costs to upgrade or expand our computer systems and architecture in order to accommodate increased or expected increases in demand. If we incur these costs, our gross margin would be adversely impacted.\nWe must develop and introduce enhancements and new features and functionality that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments to remain competitive in our evolving industry.\nWe operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. The introduction of new advertising solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new advertising industry standards could render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing platform and to continually introduce or acquire new technologies and features and functionality demanded by the market we serve. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on many factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, appropriate introduction and market acceptance. Any new solution, product or feature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new offerings or features or enhance our existing platform to meet evolving customer requirements, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nMaterial defects or errors in our platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our platform.\nThe software applications underlying our platform are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, which may cause disruptions in availability, misallocation of advertising spend or other performance problems. Any such errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our platform could negatively impact our business and our customers\u2019 businesses or the success of their advertising campaigns and causing customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation. If we have any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our platform, customers may reduce their usage or delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or lengthen our collection cycles for accounts receivable. Such performance problems could also result in customers making warranty or other claims against us, our giving credits to our customers toward future advertising spend or costly litigation. As a result, material defects or errors in our platform could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nThe costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our platform may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results. After the release of new versions of our software, defects or errors may be identified from time to time by our internal team and by our customers. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance. If we do not complete this maintenance according to schedule or if customers are otherwise dissatisfied with the frequency and/or duration of our maintenance, customers could reduce their usage of our platform or delay or withhold payment to us, or cause us to issue credits, make refunds or pay penalties.\nOur business depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to continue to successfully manage and enter into successful strategic relationships with third parties. We currently have and are seeking to establish new relationships with third parties to develop integrations with complementary technologies, sources of inventory, such as Google, and data vendors such as Nielsen. For example, in order for customers to target ads in ways they desire and otherwise optimize and verify campaigns, our platform must have access to data regarding Internet user behavior and reports with demographic information regarding Internet users. We depend on various third parties to provide this audience data and demographic reporting. Maintaining and expanding our strategic relationships with third parties is critical to our continued success. Further, our relationships with these third parties are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit the other party from working with our competitors, and in some cases our business partners also offer products or services that compete with ours, which makes these relationships more complicated and may over time lead to changes in our relationship including our loss of access to certain inventory or data supplied by these partners. These relationships may not result in additional customers or enable us to generate significant revenue and a change in these relationships could result in a loss of revenue. Identifying suitable business partners and negotiating, documenting, and maintaining relationships with them require significant time and resources. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to successfully execute campaigns, compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer.\nOur business model depends upon our ability to continue to access advertising inventory that we do not own.\nOur platform depends on access to advertising inventory controlled by publishers and various other providers, such as public ad exchanges, supply-side platforms, private marketplaces, ad networks and direct premium publishers. In particular, we rely on continued access to premium ad inventory in high-quality and brand-safe environments, viewable to consumers across multiple screens. We do not own the inventory of advertising opportunities upon which our business depends and, therefore, we might not always have access to inventory of sufficient quality or volume to meet the needs of our customers\u2019 campaigns. As a result, we may have limited visibility to our future access to inventory, especially premium ad inventory and inventory in international markets. Companies such as ad networks make media buying commitments to publishers, and may compete with us and restrict our access to media inventory of those publishers. Companies such as ad exchanges charge both publishers and advertisers fees and may be able to charge advertisers lower fees than us. In addition, many publishers sell a portion of their advertising inventory directly to advertisers, and publishers may seek to do so increasingly in the future. If that were to occur, we may have fewer opportunities to provide our customers access to inventory, which would harm our ability to grow our business and our financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from RTB exchanges and that utilize advertising solutions providers continues to increase, intermediaries or their bidding processes may favor other bidders and we may not be able to compete successfully for advertising inventory available on RTB exchanges. Even if our bids are successful, the inventory may be of low quality or misrepresented to us, despite our attempts to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks on inventory and we could be subject to liability and our business could be harmed.\nIn connection with Platform Services arrangements, we commit to delivery of a campaign at a fixed price in advance of acquiring the advertising inventory required for the campaign, exposing us to the risk that we may be unable to fulfill these commitments cost-effectively or at all.\nIn order to execute and deliver campaigns under our Platform Services arrangements, we generally enter into binding IOs with fixed price commitments which are determined prior to the launch of an advertising campaign. We do not own or otherwise control the inventory necessary to fulfill these IOs. Further, in fulfilling IO commitments, we generally purchase advertising inventory on a real-time basis during the course of the advertising campaign period, and we generally do not have fixed priced sources of supply of such inventory. Accordingly, we are not assured of having access to inventory of sufficient quality or quantity to meet the needs of our customers\u2019 campaigns on a cost-effective basis or at all. If we are unable to obtain inventory cost-effectively, or at all, our gross margins could be negatively affected or we could be unable to fulfill our obligations under the IO, which would have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain customers, potentially damage our reputation, expose us to liability and harm our revenue and growth.\nOur Platform Services customers are not obligated to pay for advertising inventory that is not consistent with their campaigns. Since we have no recourse to suppliers, we assume full risk of loss for inventory that is not accepted by our customers.\nOur Platform Services customers are not obligated to pay for advertising impressions that are not consistent with the terms of their IO with us. Further, the sources of our advertising impressions generally make no representations regarding specific characteristics of an impression relevant to any campaign. In addition, we have made and expect to continue to make purchasing decisions during the fulfillment of campaigns resulting in the purchase of impressions that are not acceptable to the advertiser. These decisions may result from mistakes due to human error by our personnel or a systems error. In other cases, third-party verification technology used by the customer may reach a different conclusion about the suitability of the inventory. In any of these cases, the advertiser may reject impressions that do not meet the terms of the IO, we may be required to provide a credit or be considered to be in breach of our obligations and we would have no recourse to the supplier. As a result, our gross margins and our ability to attract and retain customers could be negatively affected, we could be exposed to liability and our revenue and growth could be harmed.\nIf we fail to detect fraudulent or unacceptable ad placements, or if we serve advertisements on websites with inappropriate content, our reputation will be damaged, advertisers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, and we may incur liabilities.\nOur business depends in part on providing our advertisers with services that are trusted and safe for their brands and that provide the anticipated value. We frequently have contractual commitments to take reasonable measures to prevent advertisements from appearing on websites with inappropriate content or on certain websites that our advertisers may identify. Our advertisers also expect that ad placements will not be misrepresented, such as auto-play in banner placements marketed as pre-roll inventory, and that ad impressions represent the legitimate activity of human internet users. We use proprietary technologies and third party services in our efforts to detect and block inventory on websites with inappropriate content, misrepresented ad placements and fraudulent bot generated impressions. However, technologies utilized by bad actors are constantly evolving and preventing and combating fraud and inappropriate content, which is an industry-wide issue requires constant vigilance and investment of time and resources. There has recently been a significant amount of negative publicity about bot generated impressions within our industry, so our ability to combat bot generated impressions has become increasingly important. We may not always be successful in our efforts to prevent and combat fraud and inappropriate content. We may serve advertisements on inventory that is objectionable to our advertisers, and our software may also inadvertently purchase inventory on behalf of our advertisers that proves to be unacceptable for advertising campaigns, such as fraudulent bot generated impressions. In addition, negative publicity around fraudulent digital advertising placements may adversely impact the perceptions of advertisers regarding programmatic purchasing of digital advertising. As a result, we may lose the trust of our advertisers, which would harm our brand and reputation, our advertisers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may be exposed to liabilities or the need to provide credits or refunds, and our business and financial performance may be harmed.\nIf our information systems are disrupted or unauthorized access to customer data or our data is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, our reputation could be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\nWe collect, store and transmit information of, or on behalf of, our advertisers. Security breaches could result in the loss of information or financial assets, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place, our information systems and networks and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk and ongoing threats. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks such as viruses, hacking, phishing attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. This could result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data, our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our financial assets. Such attacks may also cause interruptions to the services we provide and cause customers to lose confidence in our platform. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. To date, unauthorized users have not had a material impact on our systems; however, there can be no assurance that such attacks may not be successful in the future.\nThird parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information or our financial assets. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent other security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose potential sales and existing customers or we could be subject to liability.\nIn addition we utilize third-party cloud computing services in connection with our operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party hosting/cloud computing providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact our business and results of operations, our ability to accurately report our financial results, as well as the experience of our customers. As we expand our operations, we expect to utilize additional systems and service providers that may also be essential to managing our business. Although the systems and services that we require are typically available from a number of providers, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement these relationships. Therefore, our ability to manage our business would suffer if one or more of our providers suffer an interruption in their business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, or we have to change or add systems and services. We may not be able to control the quality of the systems and services we receive from third-party service providers, which could impair our ability to maintain proper controls over financial reporting and complete timely and accurate financial reporting, and may impact our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We primarily rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws in the U.S. and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our platform.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products, services or solutions similar to ours and our ability to compete effectively would be impaired. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. In addition, we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, and could ultimately result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties.\nFurthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective protection of our intellectual property may not be available to us in every country in which our platform are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the Internet and technology industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and our competitors may hold patents or have pending patent applications, which could be related to our business. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, or non-practicing entities, whose sole primary business is to assert such claims. We have received in the past, and expect to receive in the future, notices that claim we or our customers using our platform have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources. We do not currently have an extensive patent portfolio of our own, which may limit the defenses available to us in any such litigation.\nIn addition, in many instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers against certain claims that our platform infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\ncease offering or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u00b7\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u00b7\nredesign technology to avoid infringement.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results. Furthermore, our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our customers as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our platform.\nWe use open source software in our platform. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could cause us to breach customer contracts, harm our reputation, result in customer losses or claims, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\nExpanding our international operations subjects us to new challenges and risks.\nAs of December 31, 2015 we had offices in nine countries outside the U.S., and as we continue to expand our customer base outside the U.S., our business is increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations. However, we have a limited operating history outside the U.S., and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of diverse cultures, languages, customs, tax laws, legal systems, alternate dispute systems and regulatory systems. The risks and challenges associated with international expansion include:\n\u00b7\ncontinued localization of our platform, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe need to support and integrate with local advertisers, agencies, publishers and partners;\n\u00b7\ncompetition with service providers that have greater experience in the local markets than we do or who have pre-existing relationships with potential customers in those markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations such as the EU Data Privacy Directive;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with anti-bribery laws, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in invoicing and collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u00b7\ndifferent or lesser protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, longer payment cycles, higher levels of credit risk and other collection difficulties;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with applicable laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and applicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to our international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings; and\n\u00b7\nregional economic and political conditions.\nAs a result of these risks, any potential future international expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transactions losses.\nWe currently have foreign sales and accounts receivable denominated in multiple currencies including Australian dollars, Brazilian real, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen and Singapore dollars. In addition, we purchase advertising in local currencies and incur a portion of our operating expenses in the currencies of the countries where we have offices. To the extent that our revenue from international operations increases and the scope of our international operations grows, our operating results will become more susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates. We face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. A decline in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenue when translated into U.S. dollars. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies, our revenue from international operations could be adversely affected. Our operating results could be negatively impacted depending on the amount of cost of revenue or operating expense denominated in foreign currencies. As exchange rates vary and our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions or expenses changes, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure. However, these derivative contracts may be limited in the protection they provide us from exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the contracts and potential accounting implications. Additionally, our hedging activities rely on our ability to forecast accurately and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and could contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in the foreign currency market.\nUnfavorable conditions in the global economy could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nRevenue growth and potential profitability of our business depends on the level of advertising spend in the markets we serve. To the extent that weak economic conditions cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their advertising budgets, particularly those for digital video advertising, demand for our platform may be negatively affected. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spend. If economic conditions deteriorate or do not materially improve, our customers and potential customers may elect to decrease their advertising budgets or defer or reconsider software and service purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.\nAny forecasts of market growth that we have provided or may provide in the future may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in advertising and other markets, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nOur business depends on our chief executive officer and founder and retaining and attracting qualified management and technical personnel and maintaining or expanding our sales and marketing capabilities.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of Brett Wilson, our co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, other members of our senior management team and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and operating personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. While we have offer letters with certain of our key employees, we do not have fixed term employment agreements with Mr. Wilson or any of our other key employees. Each of Mr. Wilson, other executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. Our business also requires skilled engineering, product and sales personnel, who are in high demand and are difficult to recruit and retain. As we continue to innovate and develop our platform and expand into additional geographic markets, we will require personnel with expertise in these areas. Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry and particularly so in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, where most of our technical employees are based. The loss of Mr. Wilson or any other member of our senior management team or, even a few qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business, could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and our customer relationships.\nOur ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel. These new employees require significant training and experience before they achieve full productivity. For internal planning purposes, we assume that it will take approximately nine months before a newly hired sales representative is fully trained and productive in selling our platform. This amount of time may be longer for sales personnel focused on new geographies or specific market segments. As a result, the cost of hiring and carrying new representatives cannot be offset by the revenue they produce for a significant period of time, if at all. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we would like or to the extent we expect, and we may not be able to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business. Our business will be seriously harmed if these efforts do not work as planned or generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue.\nIf the use of \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d or other tracking technologies (including pixels) is rejected by Internet users, restricted or otherwise subject to unfavorable terms, such as by non-governmental entities, or if ad blocking technologies continue to become more widely utilized by Internet users, our performance may decline and we may lose customers and revenue.\nSome features of our platform use cookies or other technologies, such as pixels, which we refer to generally as cookies. Our cookies are known as \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d because they are placed on individual browsers when Internet users visit a website on which we serve an ad. These cookies are placed through an Internet browser on an Internet user\u2019s computer and correspond with a data set that we keep on our servers. Our cookies record non-personal information about Internet users\u2019 interactions with our advertiser customers through a browser while the cookie is active. We use these cookies to help us achieve our brand advertisers\u2019 campaign goals, to help us ensure that the same Internet user does not see the same advertisement multiple times, to report aggregate information to our advertisers regarding the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. We also use data from cookies to help us decide whether to bid on, and how to price, an opportunity to place an advertisement in a certain location, at a given time, in front of a particular Internet user. If our access to cookie data is reduced, our ability to conduct our business in the current manner may be affected and thus undermine the effectiveness of our platform.\nInternet users may easily block and/or delete cookies (e.g., through their browsers by resetting mobile device advertising identifiers). The most commonly used Internet browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari) allow Internet users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. If more browser manufacturers and Internet users adopt these ad blocking settings, utilize privacy modes when browsing websites, or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently do, our business could be harmed. Some government regulators (discussed below) and privacy advocates have suggested creating a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their browser, not to have website browsing recorded. If Internet users adopt a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser setting, and the standard either imposed by state or federal legislation, or agreed upon by standard setting groups, prohibits us from using non-personal data as we currently do, then that could hinder growth of video advertising on the web generally, cause us to change our business practices and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, browser manufacturers could replace cookies with their own product and require us to negotiate and pay them for use of such product to record information about Internet users\u2019 interactions with our brand advertiser customers, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may be required to, or otherwise may determine that it is advisable to, develop or obtain additional tools and technologies to compensate for the lack of cookie data, which we may not be able to do. Moreover, even if we are able to do so, such additional tools may be subject to further regulation, time consuming to develop or costly to obtain, and less effective than our current use of cookies.\nAd blocking technologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of online digital advertising in the browsers and on the mobile devices of internet users that have implemented these technologies. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our customers\u2019 advertising spend on digital video advertising through our platform. As a result, if adoption of these ad blocking technologies by Internet users continues to increase, this could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nLegislation and regulation of online businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. Such regulation could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, or restrict portions of our business or cause us to change our technology platform or business model.\nGovernment regulation may increase the costs of doing business online. Federal, state, municipal and foreign governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, and regulations covering user privacy, data security, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, advertising online, the use of data to inform advertising, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual Internet users. Although we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, address, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial data or health data, we typically do collect and store IP addresses and other device\nidentifiers, which are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. In addition, certain U.S. laws impose requirements on the collection and use of information from or about users or their devices. For instance, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under the age of 13 years of age. COPPA requires notice and parental consent to include persistent identifiers for behavioral advertising and other tracking across websites. Other existing laws may in the future be revised, or new laws may be passed, to impose more stringent requirements on the use of identifiers to collect user information, including information of the type that we collect. Changes in regulations could affect the type of data that we may collect, restrict our ability to use identifiers to collect information, and, thus, affect our ability to collect data, the costs of doing business online, and affect the demand for our platform, the ability to expand or operate our business, and harm our business.\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators also may implement \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d legislation, particularly if the industry does not implement a standard (discussed above). The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 requires operators of commercial websites and online service providers, under certain circumstances, to disclose in their privacy policies how such operators and providers respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.\nSome of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions, whether or not we are established or based in such jurisdictions. Within the EU, where we currently have an active presence in the United Kingdom, Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the \u201cCookie Directive,\u201d directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user\u2019s computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has given his or her consent. In response, some member states have implemented legislation requiring entities to obtain the user\u2019s consent before placing cookies for targeted advertising purposes. Additional EU member state laws may follow. We may be required to, or otherwise may determine that it is advisable to, develop or obtain additional tools and technologies to compensate for the lack of cookie data. Even if we are able to do so, such additional tools may be subject to further regulation, time consuming to develop or costly to obtain, and less effective than our current use of cookies. In addition, certain information, such as IP addresses as collected and used by us may constitute \u201cpersonal data\u201d in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, including in the United Kingdom, and therefore certain of our activities could be subject to EU laws applicable to the processing and use of personal data. Furthermore, EU regulators have agreed on the text of a new General Data Protection Regulation, anticipated to take effect in 2018, which will largely replace many member state laws, potentially imposing additional obligations on us and allowing for substantial monetary penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition, we may inadvertently receive personal information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of executing video advertising campaigns or usage of our platform. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of our officers and public censure, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial performance and business. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solution by current and future advertisers and advertising agencies.\nIn addition, data security is of increasing concern to U.S., state and foreign regulators and, as a result, the legal standards for data security and the consequences for violating those standards continue to evolve and the threat posed by cyber-attacks and data breaches continues to grow. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use, and disclose in the operation of our business, and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to such information, such measures may not always be effective.\nOur revenue may be adversely affected if we are required to charge sales taxes or other taxes for our platform.\nStates, countries or other jurisdictions may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us in the future, or states or jurisdictions in which we already pay tax may increase the amount of taxes we are required to pay. A successful assertion by any state, country or other jurisdiction in which we do business that we should be collecting sales or other taxes on the revenue of our platform could, among other things, create significant administrative burdens for us, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from using our platform or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, such as keeping pace with technological developments in order to remain competitive in our evolving industry, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. In addition, we remit payment for media inventory purchased through our platform by our Platform Direct and Platform Services customers in advance of receiving payment from them as the advertising agency does not pay us for use of our platform until it has received payment from the brand. This payment process will continue to consume working capital and the effect on our cash flows may become more pronounced if we continue to grow our business. As a result, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise\nadditional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, particularly if we experience unexpected increases in advertising spend through our platform, and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.\nOur credit facility subjects us to operating restrictions and financial covenants that impose risk of default and may restrict our business and financing activities.\nPursuant to our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, as amended to date, we are subject to certain financial ratio and liquidity covenants, as well as restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\ndispose of or sell our assets;\n\u00b7\nmake material changes in our business or management;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge with other entities;\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u00b7\npay dividends;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\npay off or redeem subordinated indebtedness.\nThese covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and to pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. In the past, we were not compliant with certain administrative covenants. Although the bank waived such noncompliance in the past, there is no guarantee it will do so in the future. If a default were to occur and not be waived, such default could cause, among other remedies, all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan and security agreement to become immediately due and payable. In such an event, our liquid assets might not be sufficient to meet our repayment obligations, and we might be forced to liquidate collateral assets at unfavorable prices or our assets may be foreclosed upon and sold at unfavorable valuations.\nOur ability to renew our existing revolving line of credit, which matures in April 2017, or to enter into a new credit facility to replace or supplement the existing facility may be limited due to various factors, including the status of our business, global credit market conditions, and perceptions of our business or industry by sources of financing. In addition, if credit is available, lenders may seek more restrictive covenants and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity, increase our costs, or reduce our operating flexibility.\nIf we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain financing may negatively impact our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.\nWe may selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies that we believe could complement or expand our applications, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, we have limited experience with acquiring other businesses or technologies. If we acquire businesses or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ninability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our applications and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u00b7\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. We may also unknowingly inherit liabilities from acquired businesses or assets that arise after the acquisition and that are not adequately covered by indemnities. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial position may suffer.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with this Report, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm to the extent we decide not to avail ourselves of the exemption provided to an emerging growth company, as defined by The Jumpstart Our Businesses Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act.\nThe process of designing and implementing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, is time consuming, costly, and complicated. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, resources, including accounting and consulting expenses and management oversight as we continue to develop and refine our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if and when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, or NASDAQ, including the establishment and\nmaintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and has and will increasingly make some activities more time consuming and costly. Our management team has limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and may need to establish an internal audit function.\nAs a public company it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance on the terms that we would like and we may find it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) July 17, 2019.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2017 for state purposes and 2027 for federal purposes. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nFuture issuances of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change.\u201d It is possible that any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have and may continue to provide guidance about our business and future operating results as part of our press releases, conference calls or otherwise. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgments about our\nfuture performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results. Furthermore, if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock would decline.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our financial performance.\nTechnology stock has historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\npress releases or other public announcements by us or others, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market perception of digital video advertising solutions generally or in the effectiveness of our platform in particular;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations, new applications, features, functionality or enhancements to products, services or solutions by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u00b7\nannouncements regarding litigation involving us;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7\nour entry into new markets;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers;\n\u00b7\nthe size of our market float; and\n\u00b7\nany other factors discussed in this Report.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nSubstantial future sales of shares by our stockholders could negatively affect our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur or if there is a large number of shares of our\ncommon stock available for sale, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOur shares of common stock are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except for any shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAs of December 31, 2015, holders of an aggregate of approximately 10.9 million shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have also registered shares of common stock that we have issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and RSUs, and that we may in the future issue, under our equity compensation plans. These can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nFurthermore, certain of our executive officers have adopted, and other employees, executive officers or directors may in the future adopt written plans, known as \u201cRule 10b5-1 Plans,\u201d under which they have contracted, or may in the future contract, with a broker to sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis to diversify their assets and investments. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market , including, but not limited to sales made by our employees, executive officers and directors pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Plans, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe concentration of our common stock ownership with our executive officers, directors and affiliates will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors and owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 42% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2015. These stockholders will therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control will limit the ability of our public stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. This ownership could affect the value of shares of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to defend against a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u00b7\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprevent stockholders from calling special meetings; and\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.", "PERMNO": 14834, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "TUBE"}
