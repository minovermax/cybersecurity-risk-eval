{"cik": "1089819", "company": "Cleco Corporate Holdings LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Registrants.\nSTRUCTURAL RISKS\nHolding Company\nCleco Holdings is a holding company and its ability to meet its debt obligations is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries.\nCleco Holdings is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Cleco Holdings\u2019 ability to meet its debt obligations is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries. Cleco Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligations to pay any amounts due on Cleco Holdings\u2019 debt or to make any funds available for such payment. In addition, Cleco Holdings\u2019 subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to Cleco Holdings may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors. Substantially all of Cleco\u2019s consolidated assets are held by either Cleco Power or Cleco Cajun. Cleco Holdings\u2019 right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if Cleco Holdings were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary ranking senior to that held by Cleco Holdings. Cleco Power is subject to regulation by the LPSC. The 2016 Merger Commitments also provide for limitations on the amount of distributions that may be paid from Cleco Power to Cleco Holdings, depending on Cleco Power\u2019s common equity ratio and its corporate credit/issuer ratings. As a result, Cleco Power may be prohibited from making distributions to Cleco Holdings.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nFuture Electricity Sales\nCleco Power\u2019s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows and Cleco Cajun\u2019s future wholesale revenue and cash flows could be negatively affected by adverse macroeconomic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions resulting in low economic growth can negatively impact the businesses of Cleco Power\u2019s residential, commercial, wholesale, and industrial customers, and Cleco Cajun\u2019s wholesale customers resulting in decreased power consumption, which causes a corresponding decrease in base revenue for Cleco Power and revenue for Cleco Cajun. Reduced production or the shutdown of customer facilities could substantially reduce Cleco Power\u2019s base revenue and Cleco Cajun\u2019s revenue.\nEnergy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other factors that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRegulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and incentives to reduce energy consumption. Conservation and energy efficiency programs are designed to reduce energy demand. Future electricity sales could be impacted by customers switching to alternative sources of energy, such as solar and wind, on-site power generation, and retail customers purchasing less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or expanded energy efficiency measures. Declining usage could result in an under-recovery of fixed costs at Cleco Power\u2019s rate regulated business. An increase in energy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other efforts that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nWeather Sensitivity\nCleco\u2019s operations and power generation could be harmed due to the impact of severe weather events, other natural disasters, or climate change, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nSevere weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, tropical storms, and other natural disasters, such as floods, can affect transportation of fuel to plant sites and can be destructive, causing outages, blackouts or disruptions of interconnected transmission systems, and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenue, and additional capital restoration costs. Extreme drought conditions can impact the availability of cooling water to support the operations of generating plants, which can also result in additional expenses and lower revenue. Extreme weather conditions could also increase commodity prices, including fuel, which could have a material adverse effect on Cleco\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nClimate change that results in more frequent and more severe weather events in Cleco\u2019s service territory, could result in one or more physical risks, such as an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding, and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and potential increased impacts of extreme winter weather conditions, including ice storms, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. The Registrants\u2019 assets are in and serve communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. In addition, a significant portion of the nation\u2019s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and is susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes.\nFor example, during 2020 and 2021, Cleco\u2019s service territory sustained substantial damage from four separate hurricanes and two winter storms that resulted in damage to Cleco Power\u2019s distribution and transmission assets, electricity\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\ngeneration supply shortages, natural gas supply shortages, increases in prices of natural gas in the U.S., and significant outages for Cleco Power\u2019s customers. For more information on the hurricanes and severe winter storms, see Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 19 - Storm Restoration, Securitization, and Cost Recovery.\u201d\nAny future severe weather, other natural disaster, or physical changes resulting from climate change could cause damage to, or the loss of, Cleco\u2019s equipment and facilities, which could result in Cleco incurring additional costs, such as the cost to restore service, repair damaged facilities, or obtain replacement power. Any future severe weather, other natural disaster, or physical changes resulting from climate change could also result in changes in demand for and usage of electricity in Cleco\u2019s service territory and the service territory of Cleco\u2019s wholesale customers. The delivery of equipment and supplies necessary to Cleco\u2019s business could also be disrupted. Cleco Power\u2019s recovery of costs associated with these events is subject to LPSC review and approval, and the LPSC could disallow timely and full recovery of the costs incurred. These risks and other possible effects of severe weather, other natural disasters, and climate change could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe operating results of Cleco are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity, particularly with respect to residential customers. In Cleco\u2019s service territory, demand for power typically peaks during the hot summer months. As a result, Cleco\u2019s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, Cleco has sold less power and, consequently, earned less income when weather conditions were milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For information regarding the hurricanes and winter storms that caused damages to Cleco\u2019s service territory in 2020 and 2021, see Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 19 - Storm Restoration, Securitization, and Cost Recovery.\u201d\nWorkforce\nFailure to attract, retain, and develop an appropriately qualified workforce could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, lack of equivalent and enhanced skill sets to fulfill future needs, or unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, difficulty in finding qualified candidates due to geographic locations, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or the availability of potential new hires, a remote work option, and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the Registrants\u2019 business. If the\nRegistrants are unable to successfully attract, retain, and develop an appropriately qualified workforce, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected.\nTechnology and Terrorism Threats\nThe operational and information technology systems on which Cleco relies to conduct its business and serve customers could fail to function properly due to technological problems, cyberattacks, physical attacks on Cleco\u2019s assets, acts of terrorism, severe weather, solar events, electromagnetic events, natural disasters, the age and condition of information technology assets, human error, or other reasons that could disrupt Cleco\u2019s operations and cause Cleco to incur unanticipated losses and expense.\nThe operation of Cleco\u2019s extensive electrical systems relies on evolving operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are becoming extremely complex as new technologies and systems are implemented to more safely and reliably deliver electric services. Cleco\u2019s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a real-time daily basis, a large number of tasks and transactions, many of which are highly complex. Cleco\u2019s remote working environment (whether due to COVID-19 or a voluntary hybrid work schedule) makes protecting distributed assets more challenging, and there is a greater opportunity for successful cyberattacks. The failure of Cleco\u2019s operational and information technology systems and networks due to a physical attack or cyberattack, or other event would significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; result in damage to Cleco\u2019s assets or operations, or those of third parties; and subject Cleco to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco\u2019s systems, including its financial information, operational, advanced metering, and billing systems, require constant maintenance, monitoring, security patches, modification or configuration of systems, and update and upgrade of systems, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the modification, transition to, or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources, and could adversely affect the effectiveness of Cleco\u2019s control environment, and/or its ability to accurately or timely file required regulatory reports.\nDespite implementation of security and mitigation measures, all of Cleco\u2019s technology systems and those of Cleco\u2019s vendors are vulnerable to inoperability, impaired operations, or failures due to physical attacks or cyberattacks on the facilities and equipment needed to operate the technology systems, viruses, human errors, acts of war or terrorism, and other events. If Cleco\u2019s or its vendor\u2019s information technology systems or network infrastructure were to fail, Cleco might be unable to fulfill critical business functions and serve its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions, results of operations, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Cleco collects and retains sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage, and other confidential information.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nThe theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data could subject Cleco to both penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws and claims from third parties, or harm Cleco\u2019s reputation. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability.\nPandemics, Epidemics, or Other Outbreaks\nCleco faces risks related to COVID-19 and other pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks, including economic, regulatory, legal, workforce, and cybersecurity risks, which could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or liquidity of the Registrants.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (and other pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks) has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect global economic activities and conditions. An extended slowdown of economic growth, decreased demand for commodities, and/or material changes in governmental or regulatory policy in the U.S. could result in lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity in Cleco\u2019s service territory, and those of its wholesale customers, as businesses and facilities continue to close, remain closed, or implement reduced working hours. The ability of Cleco\u2019s customers to meet their obligations to Cleco, including payment obligations, could also be negatively affected under these economic conditions. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread, especially in light of recent variants such as the Delta and Omicron variants, and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business and government shutdowns that could reduce the availability and productivity of Cleco employees, key contractors, and vendors. Cleco\u2019s ability to timely satisfy regulatory requirements, such as recordkeeping and/or timely reporting requirements, could be affected. If Cleco\u2019s employees or third-party service providers were to work remotely, Cleco could face heightened cybersecurity risks related to unauthorized system access, aggressive social engineering tactics, and adversaries attacking the information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct its business. These impacts could ultimately result in a downgrade of Cleco\u2019s credit ratings.\nOn December 4, 2020, Cleco Power made a filing with the LPSC requesting recovery of the expenses incurred as a result of an LPSC executive order prohibiting the disconnection of utilities for nonpayment, as well as the lost revenue associated with the disconnection fees and incremental costs. At December 31, 2021, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset of $3.0 million for expenses incurred. For more information regarding the regulatory asset associated with the LPSC\u2019s executive order, see Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 6 - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - COVID-19 Executive Order.\nCleco cannot predict the duration or extent of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks, governmental responsive measures, or the extent of the effects or ultimate impacts on the global, national, or local\neconomy, the capital markets, its suppliers, or customers. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or liquidity of the Registrants.\nTransmission Constraints\nTransmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nEnergy prices in the MISO market are based on LMP, which includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion may have a higher LMP. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun\u2019s pricing zones or result in transmission curtailments. Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun are awarded and/or purchase FTRs in auctions facilitated by MISO. However, insufficient FTR allocations or increased FTR costs, due to negative congestion flows, may result in an unexpected increase in energy costs to Cleco\u2019s customers. For Cleco Power, if a disallowance of additional fuel costs associated with congestion is ordered by the LPSC resulting in a refund to Cleco Power\u2019s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco\u2019s Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Facilities\nCleco\u2019s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages, significant maintenance requirements, and interruption of fuel deliveries.\nThe operation of power generation facilities involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel supply interruption, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Aging equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency, or to comply with environmental permits. Newer equipment can also be subject to unexpected failures. Accordingly, Cleco may incur more frequent unplanned outages, higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures, higher replacement costs of purchased power, increased fuel costs, MISO related costs, and the loss of potential revenue related to competitive opportunities. The costs of such repairs, maintenance, and purchased power may not be fully recoverable in rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco\u2019s generating facilities are currently fueled primarily by coal, natural gas, and petroleum coke. The deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand, decreased regional supply, production shortages, weather-related disturbances, railroad constraints, waterway levels, labor strikes, or lack of transportation capacity. If suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel and associated inventories are depleted, Cleco Power may be unable to operate generating units which may cause Cleco Power to operate at higher overall energy costs, which would increase the cost to customers. Cleco Power\u2019s fuel and MISO-procured/settled energy expenses, which are recovered from its customers through the FAC, are subject to\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nrefund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the LPSC.\nCleco Power could be indirectly liable for the impacts of other companies\u2019 activities on lands that have been mined and reclaimed by Cleco Power. The liability for impacts on reclaimed lands may not be recoverable in rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe construction of and capital improvements to power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be significantly more expensive than planned, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the Registrants could be materially affected.\nCleco\u2019s ability to complete construction of or capital improvements to power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include engineering and project execution risk and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as set forth under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, inaccurate cost estimates, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel or material costs, changes in the economy, changes in laws or regulations, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of Cleco may materially affect the schedule and cost of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Cleco could incur additional costs including termination payments, face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project, or Cleco Power may not be able to recover such costs in rates. Furthermore, failure to maintain various levels of generating unit availability or transmission and distribution reliability may result in various disallowances of Cleco Power\u2019s investments.\nAlternative Generation Technology\nChanges in technology may have a material adverse effect on the value of Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun\u2019s generating facilities.\nA basic premise of Cleco\u2019s business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. There are alternative technologies to produce electricity, most notably wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, and other solar generated power. Many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies. As new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity purchased by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generating assets. To the extent Cleco is slow to adopt viable alternative generation technologies, employs technology that is problematic to operate, and/or under or over relies on these alternative technologies, the value of Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun\u2019s generating facilities could be reduced.\nLitigation\nCleco is subject to litigation related to the 2016 Merger.\nIn connection with the 2016 Merger, four actions were filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, Louisiana and three actions were filed in the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana. See Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to the Financial Statements - Note 15 - Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees - Litigation - 2016 Merger\u201d for a discussion of these actions.\nIt is possible that additional claims beyond those that have already been filed will be brought by the current plaintiffs or by others in an effort to seek monetary relief from Cleco\u2019s former directors and officers. Cleco is not able to predict the outcome of these actions, or others, nor can Cleco predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the actions. In addition, the cost to Cleco of defending the actions, even if resolved in the defendants\u2019 favor, could be substantial. Such actions could also divert the attention of Cleco\u2019s management and resources from day-to-day operations.\nCleco Cajun\nThe success of Cleco Cajun depends, in part, on Cleco\u2019s ability to manage the acquired business and realize anticipated benefits.\nOn February 4, 2019, Cleco acquired all of the membership interests of South Central Generating upon the closing of the Cleco Cajun Transaction. The success of Cleco Cajun will depend, in part, on Cleco\u2019s ability to manage and operate the unregulated business through service to electric cooperative customers and other wholesale customers. The majority of Cleco Cajun\u2019s capacity is contracted through the first quarter of 2025.\nIn 2020 and 2021, electric cooperatives currently under contract with Cleco Cajun conducted three separate requests for proposal for capacity and energy starting in 2025. Cleco Cajun participated in the three processes and was not selected as the provider of capacity and energy through two of the requests for proposal. On January 25, 2022, the LPSC certified the results of the first request for proposal. Cleco Cajun is an intervener in the LPSC\u2019s certification process for the second request for proposal. The third request for proposal is ongoing. Cleco Cajun was notified that it was not selected to provide capacity and energy to one of the electric cooperatives participating in the third request for proposal. A notice has not been filed with the LPSC requesting certification of the third request for proposal results as of March 7, 2022. Cleco Cajun will continue to monitor the LPSC\u2019s certification processes. Failure to recontract these agreements or enter into new contracts to replace existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on Cleco Cajun\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Cleco Cajun\u201d for more information regarding Cleco Cajun\u2019s progress in recontracting or entering into new contracts.\nFailure to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Cleco Cajun Transaction could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of Cleco.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nREGULATORY RISKS\nStorm Restoration Cost Recovery\nCleco Power\u2019s ability to recover costs resulting from storm damage is subject to a prudency review and approval by the LPSC.\nIn August and October 2020, Cleco Power\u2019s distribution and transmission systems sustained catastrophic damage from three separate hurricanes resulting in total storm restoration costs of approximately $239.8 million. In August 2021, Cleco Power sustained additional significant damage to its distribution and transmission systems from Hurricane Ida, which resulted in total storm restoration costs of approximately $92.0 million. The damage to equipment from the hurricanes required replacement, as well as repair of existing assets. At December 31, 2021, Cleco Power had regulatory assets, as allowed by the LPSC, for non-capital expenses resulting from Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Zeta, and Ida totaling $112.3 million.\nIn February 2021, Winter Storms Uri and Viola caused Cleco\u2019s service territory to experience extreme and unprecedented winter weather that resulted in damage to Cleco Power\u2019s distribution assets and caused electricity generation supply shortages, natural gas supply shortages, and increases in prices of natural gas in the U.S., primarily due to prolonged freezing temperatures. Cleco Power\u2019s total storm restoration costs related to Winter Storms Uri and Viola are approximately $10.1 million. At December 31, 2021, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset for non-capital expenses of $1.9 million, as allowed by the LPSC. Cleco Power\u2019s incremental fuel and purchased power costs incurred as a result of Winter Storms Uri and Viola are approximately $55.0 million. On March 29, 2021, Cleco Power received approval from the LPSC to recover $50.0 million of these costs over a period of 12 months beginning with the May 2021 bills. On May 11, 2021, Cleco Power received notice of an audit from the LPSC for the fuel costs incurred during the time period required to restore services to Cleco Power\u2019s customers during Winter Storms Uri and Viola. Cleco Power is responding to related data requests. Management is unable to determine the outcome or timing of the audit.\nOn May 19, 2021, the LPSC issued an order authorizing Cleco Power to recover $16.0 million annually for interim storm recovery. On June 1, 2021, Cleco Power began collecting this amount through rates. This order is effective until such time that the securitization of those costs is complete, which is expected in mid-2022.\nCleco Power has made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval for recovery of a portion of the restoration costs through the issuance of dedicated securitization bonds, which would be repaid over time through a system restoration charge imposed on Cleco Power\u2019s customers. On August 5, 2021, Cleco Power filed testimony with the LPSC relating to securitization of the final storm costs for Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta, and Winter Storms Uri and Viola, totaling $342.0 million, including the establishment of a newly funded $100.0 million storm reserve to cover future storm costs. On September 28, 2021, Cleco Power filed supplemental testimony with the LPSC relating to storm securitization requesting an additional $100.0 million for a separate storm reserve to cover costs associated with Hurricane Ida. Cleco Power continues to respond to several sets of data requests received from the LPSC related to the securitization application. Cleco expects the LPSC to issue its order\nauthorizing the recovery of the verified final storm costs in late March 2022 and securitization of those costs to be complete in mid-2022.\nRestoration costs that were incurred by Cleco Power as a result of storm damages are subject to a prudency review by the LPSC. The LPSC has authority to disallow costs found to not have been prudently incurred. Accordingly, Cleco Power may not be able to recover some of the restoration costs incurred, which could be material.\nThe inability of Cleco Power\u2019s customers to continue paying their utility bills or a decision by the LPSC to deny Cleco Power\u2019s request to recover incurred restoration costs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the Registrants.\nRegulatory Compliance\nCleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 business or result in significant additional costs.\nCleco\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local energy, environmental, and other laws and regulations. Should Cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on Cleco, Cleco\u2019s business could be adversely affected. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to Cleco or Cleco\u2019s facilities in a manner that may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 business or result in significant additional costs.\nAs a result of the 2016 Merger, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power made the 2016 Merger Commitments to the LPSC including, but not limited to, the extension of Cleco Power\u2019s current FRP for an additional two years, maintaining employee headcount, salaries, and benefits for ten years, and a limitation from incurring additional long-term debt, excluding non-recourse debt, unless certain financial ratios are achieved. Additionally, upon approval of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, Cleco made commitments to the LPSC including, but not limited to, holding Cleco Power retail customers harmless for any adverse impacts, increased costs of debt or equity, and credit rating downgrades attributable to the Cleco Cajun Transaction and the repayment of $400.0 million of Cleco Holdings\u2019 debt by 2024.\nCleco Power\u2019s Rates\nThe LPSC and FERC regulate the retail rates and wholesale transmission tariffs, respectively, that Cleco Power can charge its customers.\nCleco Power\u2019s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its LPSC-jurisdictional customers through LPSC-approved rates and its ability to recover its FERC-authorized revenue requirements from its FERC-jurisdictional wholesale transmission customers. Cleco Power\u2019s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. If Cleco Power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\ncould be materially adversely affected. Recovery of these costs could result in rising utility bills threatening the affordability of such costs by Cleco Power\u2019s customers in certain demographic areas, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases or, in some cases, a request for extension of an FRP. During those cases, the LPSC determines Cleco Power\u2019s rate base, depreciation rates, operation and maintenance costs, and administrative and general costs that Cleco Power may recover from its retail customers through its rates. In some instances, the outcome of a rate case or request for extension of an FRP may impact wholesale decisions of Cleco Power. These proceedings may examine, among other things, the prudency of Cleco Power\u2019s operation and maintenance practices, level of subject expenditures, allowed rates of return, and previously incurred capital expenditures. The LPSC has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred. Rate cases generally have timelines of approximately one year, and decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty. The transmission tariffs of Cleco Power are regulated by FERC with its own regulatory proceedings. Both the LPSC and FERC regulatory proceedings can involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, all of whom have differing concerns but who have the common objective of just and reasonable rates.\nTransmission rates that MISO transmission owners may collect are regulated by FERC. In November 2019, FERC voted to adopt new methodology for evaluating base ROE for public utilities under the Federal Power Act. Cleco Power is unable to determine when a binding FERC order will be issued. Any reduction to the ROE component of the transmission rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nRetail Electric Service\nCleco Power\u2019s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the LPSC and reviews may result in refunds to customers.\nCleco Power\u2019s retail rates for residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the LPSC. Cleco Power\u2019s new retail rate plan became effective on July 1, 2021. The LPSC will continue to conduct an annual review of Cleco Power\u2019s earnings and regulatory ROE beginning with the 12 months ending June 30, 2022. Cleco Power\u2019s required refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the LPSC review could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco Power\u2019s next base rate case is required to be filed with the LPSC on or before March 31, 2023. The outcome of any future base rate case could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the Registrants.\nLPSC Audits\nThe LPSC conducts fuel audits that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nGenerally, Cleco Power\u2019s cost of fuel used for electric generation and cost of purchased power are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. The LPSC FAC General Order issued in November 1997 in Docket No. U-21497 provides that an audit will be performed at least every other year.\nIn March 2020, Cleco Power received a notice of audit from the LPSC for the period of January 2018 to December 2019. The total amount of fuel expense included in the audit is $565.8 million. Cleco Power has responded to several sets of data requests from the LPSC. Cleco Power has FAC filings for January 2020 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. On March 29, 2021, Cleco Power received approval from the LPSC to recover $50.0 million of incremental fuel and purchased power costs incurred as a result of Winter Storms Uri and Viola over a period of 12 months beginning in May 2021. On May 11, 2021, Cleco Power received notice of an audit from the LPSC for the fuel costs incurred during the time period required to restore services to Cleco Power\u2019s customers during Winter Storms Uri and Viola. Cleco Power is responding to related data requests. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. If a disallowance of fuel costs is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power\u2019s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe LPSC conducts audits of environmental costs that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nIn 2009, the LPSC issued Docket No. U-29380 Subdocket A, which provides Cleco Power an EAC to recover from customers certain costs of environmental compliance. The costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other things. These expenses are eligible for recovery through Cleco Power\u2019s EAC and subject to periodic review by the LPSC.\nOn October 20, 2021, the LPSC approved the EAC audit for the period of January 2018 to December 2019 with no findings. The total amount of environmental expense that was included in the audit was $26.2 million. Cleco Power has EAC filings for January 2020 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. If a disallowance of environmental costs is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power\u2019s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nFERC Audit\nFERC conducts audits that could result in Cleco Power making refunds of previously recorded revenue.\nGenerally, Cleco Power records wholesale transmission revenue through approved formula rates, Attachment O of the MISO tariff, and certain grandfathered agreements. The calculation of the rate formulas, as well as FERC accounting and reporting requirements, are subject to periodic audits by FERC. In March 2018, the Division of Audits and Accounting within the Office of Enforcement of FERC initiated an audit of Cleco Power for the period of January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2019. As a result of a refund analysis based on audit findings, a total of $4.4 million was returned to Cleco Power\u2019s wholesale transmission customers as a combination of refund payments and a reduction in Attachment O of the MISO tariff and grandfathered agreement rates. On February 1, 2022, FERC notified Cleco of the completion of the audit and no exceptions were found to the implementation of the audit recommendations. Management is unable to predict the timing of future audits and whether or not the outcome of such future audits will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nMISO\nMISO market operations could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, generation revenues, energy supply costs, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCleco is a member of the MISO market region referred to as \u201cMISO South,\u201d which encompasses parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Dispatch of generation resources and generation volumes to the market is determined by MISO. Costs in the MISO South region are heavily influenced by commodity fuel prices, transmission congestion, dispatch of the generating assets owned not only by Cleco, but by all market participants in the MISO South region, and the overall demand and generation availability in the region.\nMISO evaluates forced outage rates to assess generating unit capacity for Cleco\u2019s planning reserve margin. If Cleco is subject to a significant amount of forced outages, Cleco may not possess sufficient planning reserves to serve its needs and could be forced to purchase capacity from the MISO resource adequacy auction. For Cleco Power, the costs of such capacity may not be recoverable in its rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Using MISO\u2019s unforced capacity method for determining generating unit capacity, Cleco Power\u2019s fleet provided for 319 MW of capacity in excess of its peak, coincident to MISO\u2019s peak, in 2021.\nReliability and CIP Standards Compliance\nCleco is subject to mandatory reliability and CIP standards. Fines and civil penalties are imposed on those who fail to comply with these standards.\nNERC serves as the ERO with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability and CIP standards, subject to FERC approval, for users of the nation\u2019s transmission system. FERC enforces compliance with these standards. New standards are being developed and existing standards are continuously being modified.\nAs these standards continue to be adopted and modified, they may impose additional compliance requirements on Cleco\nPower and Cleco Cajun separately, which may result in increased capital expenditures and operating expenses. Failure to comply with these standards can result in the imposition of material fines and civil penalties.\nA NERC Reliability Standards audit and NERC CIP Audit are conducted every three years for Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. For more information on Cleco\u2019s current and future audits, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Financial Condition - Regulatory and Other Matters - Market Structure - Wholesale Electric Markets - ERO.\u201d\nManagement is unable to predict the financial outcome of any future audits or whether any findings will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nCleco\u2019s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant. The costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations, as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities, could be significant to the Registrants.\nCleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal, state, and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities. Existing environmental laws, regulations, and permits could be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to Cleco. As a result, some of Cleco\u2019s EGUs could be rendered uneconomical to maintain or operate and could prompt early retirement of certain generation units. Any legal obligation that would require Cleco to substantially reduce its emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of some fossil fuels as fuel for new and existing EGUs. Cleco will evaluate potential solutions to comply with such regulations and monitor rulemaking and any legal matters impacting the proposed regulations. Cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with such revisions, reinterpretations, and new requirements. If Cleco were to fail to comply, it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce production from its facilities. Cleco cannot predict the timing or the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals.\nCleco Power may request from its customers recovery of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and regulations. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power\u2019s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nWholesale Electric Service\nCleco\u2019s business practices are regulated by FERC, and the wholesale rates of both Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun are subject to FERC\u2019s triennial market power analysis. Cleco Power and/or Cleco Cajun could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates.\nFERC requires a utility to pass a screening test as a condition for securing and/or retaining approval to sell electricity in wholesale markets at market-based rates. An updated market power analysis must be filed with FERC every three years or upon the occurrence of a change in status as defined by FERC regulation. Cleco filed its most recent triennial market power analysis in December 2020, and it is currently pending FERC approval. The next triennial market power analysis is expected to be filed in December 2023. In the future, if FERC determines Cleco Power and/or Cleco Cajun possesses generation market power in excess of certain thresholds, Cleco Power and/or Cleco Cajun could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates, which could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nCommodity and Commercial Transactions\nCleco may enter into fuel supply contracts, energy hedge transactions, and/or commercial transactions, including sales to wholesale customers. If risks related to these transactions are not managed effectively, they may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Registrants.\nCleco Power and Cleco Cajun may each enter into purchases or sales of certain physical and financial commodity contracts for the purpose of supply, customer transactions, hedging, and market operations. Cleco adheres to internal controls and risk management guidelines approved by EMT in order to manage risks related to those transactions. However, those internal controls or guidelines may not be effective or implemented as expected. All risks associated with these transactions cannot be fully eliminated. Therefore, the judgements and assumptions made in the underlying decisions related to these transactions could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nCommodity Prices\nCleco Power and Cleco Cajun\u2019s financial performance could be exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices and other factors, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nBecause Cleco is exposed to uncertain market prices of electricity, natural gas, coal, and other commodities that can impact costs of fuel supply for generation, generation revenue, cost to serve its contracted wholesale electricity customers, and revenue from these customers, Cleco may enter into transactions to mitigate the volatility in those costs that are accounted for as derivatives.\nFor Cleco Power, the changes in fair value of transactions accounted for as derivatives are deferred as a component of deferred fuel assets or liabilities in accordance with regulatory\npolicy. When transactions expire or are offset through liquidation, actual gains or losses are deferred and included in Cleco Power\u2019s FAC. Recovery of these costs included in Cleco Power\u2019s FAC is subject to, and may be disallowed as part of, a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the LPSC. For Cleco Cajun, the changes in fair value of transactions accounted for as derivatives, as well as the actual gains and losses at settlement, are reflected in current period earnings as either a component of fuel expense, for gas-related derivatives, or purchased power expense, for FTRs. As a result, Cleco is unable to accurately predict the effect that these transactions could have on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nCounterparty Risk and Guarantees\nCleco may be required to provide credit support to its counterparties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 liquidity.\nCleco may guarantee the performance of all or some of its commercial transaction obligations and may also be required to provide counterparty credit support in the form of cash or cash equivalent collateral or margin to secure all or part of those obligations. Downgrades in Cleco\u2019s credit quality or changes in the market prices of transaction-related energy commodities could increase the collateral or margin required to be on deposit with the counterparty or clearing house. The required credit support or increase in credit support could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 liquidity.\nCleco is exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their performance obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial performance of the Registrants.\nCounterparties may fail to perform on their physical or financial obligations. Currently, Cleco has industry accepted master agreements in place with counterparties that provide credit default language. Some master agreements with counterparties contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Cleco. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Cleco may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided; however, in the event of a default, credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Cleco may incur losses in excess of amounts already paid, if any, to the counterparties or due to an adverse replacement cost of the transaction.\nThe credit commitments of Cleco\u2019s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. In no case would Cleco Power bear any commodity or credit risk of Cleco Cajun.\nGlobal Economic Environment and Uncertainty\nAdverse capital market performance could result in reductions in the fair value of benefit plan assets and increase the Registrants\u2019 liabilities related to such plans. Sustained declines in the fair value of the plan\u2019s assets or sustained increases in plan liabilities could result in significant increases in funding requirements, which could adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 liquidity and results of operations.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nthat are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under Cleco\u2019s defined benefit pension plan. Sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by Cleco and could increase Cleco\u2019s funding requirements related to the pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the present value of Cleco\u2019s liabilities under the pension plan. Adverse changes in assumptions or adverse actual events could cause additional minimum contributions.\nCleco Credit Ratings\nA downgrade in Cleco Holdings\u2019 or Cleco Power\u2019s credit ratings could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs, a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources, and a restriction on Cleco Power making distributions to Cleco Holdings.\nNeither Cleco Holdings nor Cleco Power can assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. If S&P, Moody\u2019s, or Fitch were to downgrade Cleco Holdings\u2019 or Cleco Power\u2019s long-term ratings, particularly below investment grade, the value of their debt securities would be adversely affected. Downgrades of either Cleco Holdings\u2019 or Cleco Power\u2019s credit ratings could result in additional fees and higher interest rates for borrowings under their respective credit facilities and term loans. In addition, Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power, as the case may be, would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings, may be subject to more onerous debt covenants, and their pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease. In addition, the 2016 Merger Commitments provide for limitations on the amount of distributions that may be paid from Cleco Power to Cleco Holdings, depending on Cleco Power\u2019s common equity ratio and its corporate credit/issuer ratings. As a result, Cleco Power may be prohibited from making distributions to Cleco Holdings in the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade. Following Hurricane Ida in August 2021, S&P revised the outlook on Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power to negative from stable.\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s Unsecured and Unsubordinated Obligations\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including, without limitation, its senior notes, will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt of Cleco Power LLC and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities and preferred equity of any of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s subsidiaries.\nCleco Power LLC\u2019s senior notes and its obligations under various loan agreements and refunding agreements with the Rapides Finance Authority, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority, and other issuers of tax-exempt bonds for the benefit of Cleco Power LLC are unsecured and rank equally with all of Cleco Power LLC\u2019s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, Cleco Power LLC had an aggregate of $1.81 billion of unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness net of debt discount and debt expense. The unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Cleco Power LLC will be effectively subordinated to, and thus have a junior position to, any secured debt that Cleco Power LLC may have outstanding from time to time (including any mortgage bonds) with respect to the assets securing such debt. Certain agreements entered into by Cleco Power LLC with other lenders that are unsecured\nprovide that if Cleco Power LLC issues secured debt, Cleco Power LLC is obligated to grant these lenders the same security interest in certain assets of Cleco Power LLC. If such a security interest were to arise, it would further subordinate Cleco Power LLC\u2019s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Cleco Power LLC had no secured indebtedness outstanding. Cleco Power LLC may issue mortgage bonds in the future under any future Indenture of Mortgage, and holders of mortgage bonds would have a prior claim on certain Cleco Power LLC material assets upon dissolution, winding up, liquidation, or reorganization.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nPresidential Administration\nThe Presidential administration has made and may continue to make substantial changes to environmental, fiscal, and tax policies that could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 business.\nThe Presidential administration may propose substantial changes to environmental, fiscal, and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform, more stringent requirements for reducing GHG emissions and other air pollutants from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, and other objectives that may impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Since taking office in January 2021, the current President has issued several executive orders designed to address climate change and GHG emissions, as well as an executive order requiring agencies to review past environmental actions. Furthermore, the current President has recommitted the U.S. to the Paris Agreement and announced the U.S.\u2019 nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement at the summit on climate change on April 22, 2021. The target aims to reduce U.S. emissions by 50-52% compared to a 2005 baseline by 2030. The Presidential administration has also issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the administration has reviewed and approved the rule. The executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations and it is possible that these changes could adversely affect Cleco\u2019s business. Until any such changes are enacted, management is unable to determine the impact of any such changes on the Registrants\u2019 business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nTaxes\nChanges in taxation due to uncertain effects of the various tax reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), commonly referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, was signed into law on November 15, 2021. This act includes new investments for all modes of transportation, water, power and energy, environmental remediation, public lands, broadband, and resilience. Management does not expect this legislation will have a significant impact on Cleco, but will continue to monitor the impact of the regulations under the IIJA.\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nOn November 19, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act (BBBA); however, the U.S. Senate declined to vote on the legislation in its current form. The act targets individual tax relief, clean energy incentives, and increased spending on healthcare, education, childcare, and other programs. There are several tax and renewables provisions in this legislation that could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial conditions, or cash flows of the Registrants. Management continues to monitor the legislative status of the BBBA and any successor legislation.\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants make judgments regarding the utilization of existing income tax credits and the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. Tax obligations include income, franchise, property, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results, or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by the Registrants could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nInsurance\nCleco\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient and may become more costly to maintain.\nCleco currently has property, casualty, cybersecurity, and liability insurance policies in place to protect its employees, board of managers, and assets in amounts that it considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Cleco\u2019s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLike other utilities that serve coastal regions, Cleco Power does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because it believes such insurance to be cost prohibitive. In the future, Cleco Power may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm recovery bonds or a change in Cleco Power\u2019s regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Cleco Power may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nLitigation\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nThe Registrants are party to various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary operations of their business. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Registrants may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and, as a result, these matters may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainty and Access to Capital\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nCertain of Cleco\u2019s current debt agreements bear interest at rates based on LIBOR. These agreements include Cleco\u2019s revolving credit facilities, term loans, and the floating rate senior notes due in 2023. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. In November 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR quotations, announced a consultation on the extension of the quotation of most LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, for legacy contracts only. This deadline has been extended and most key U.S. dollar-denominated LIBOR tenors will continue to be published until June 30, 2023. Cleco\u2019s revolving credit facilities, term loans, and the floating rate senior notes due in 2023 issued by Cleco Power incorporate fallback language mechanisms to accommodate the eventual establishment of an alternate rate of interest, including alternative benchmark rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, upon the occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of any applicable interest rate. The overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or liquidity.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the Registrants\u2019 cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital to operate and grow the business.\nThe Registrants\u2019 business is capital intensive and dependent upon the Registrants\u2019 respective abilities to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. The Registrants\u2019 liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster or when there are spikes in the price of natural gas and other commodities. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel, purchased power, or storm restoration costs; higher than expected required pension contributions; an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines; less cash flow from operations than expected; or other\nCLECO\nCLECO POWER 2021 FORM 10-K\nunexpected events, could cause the financing needs of the Registrants to increase materially.\nEvents beyond the Registrants\u2019 control, such as political uncertainty in the U.S. (including the ongoing debates related to the U.S. federal government budget), as well as volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, may create uncertainty that could increase their cost of capital or impair their ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on their respective bank credit facilities. Additionally, upon approval of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, Cleco made commitments to the LPSC including, but not limited to, holding Cleco Power retail customers harmless for any adverse impacts, increased costs of debt or equity, and credit rating downgrades attributable to the Cleco Cajun Transaction; and the repayment of $400.0 million of Cleco Holdings\u2019 debt by 2024. At December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Cleco Holdings\u2019 debt to be repaid by 2024 was $200.0 million. The Registrants may be unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their respective credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If the Registrants are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants\u2019 ability to fund\ncapital expenditures or to service debt, or on the Registrants\u2019 flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nESG\nIncreased focus on and changing expectations regarding ESG programs may result in constraints on the Registrants\u2019 access to capital and increased costs and expenses.\nStakeholder scrutiny of companies\u2019 ESG practices has been increasing across numerous industries. In recent years, certain stakeholders, including an increasing number of investors and lenders, have started placing more importance on ESG criteria when making lending and investment decisions. Although the Registrants are not currently aware of any instances where their access to capital was limited due to these developments, the increased focus on and activism related to ESG may potentially limit their access to capital or financing as some investors or lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the Registrants or reallocate or not commit capital based on their assessment of the Registrants\u2019 ESG profile. Additionally, failure to address and meet stakeholders\u2019 ESG expectations, which continue to evolve, or failure to report progress on ESG initiatives may negatively impact the Registrants\u2019 reputation and business or could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.", "PERMNO": 64557, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "CNL"}
